Possibly the worst book I have ever read+N+While I realize that the majority of people thought this to be a stellar book, it reminds me of the story, "The Emperor has no clothes".  Yes, Choan can write a beautiful sentence and yes, the first several pages were intriguing but the switching of years was very annoying.  The "flipping back and forth" was not accomplished in a smooth, flowing manner.  In addition, the subject matter was incredibly depressing and the characters were so flawed that one did not even care about how their lives evolved.  The kidnapping was predictable and the ending contrived.  It would be impossible to recommend this book to anyone+books
BORING WITH A TOTAL  LACK OF CLARITY+N+I had never read any of  Vernor Vinges books before, but i had heard he was an excellent author, so I thought I would try this.  Boy, am I glad I bought it used on Amazon for about only $4.  I simply had no idea what was going on in this novel. The plot is unintelligible. I dont know what the Bioweapon  the jacket refers to is? I dont know what "the Rabbit" is.  I see that numerous other reviews here, did not know what was going on either. I do not understand how someone could write so incoherently.  The concept of someone who had Alzheimers getting cured & entering a future society is great - but it never goes anywhere.  The only reason I did not fall asleep, was that I was trying to figure out what was going on, but I did could not  even finish this book+books
Author sneaks in biblical misinterpretation, poor editing.+N+I got this as both a book and an audio file.  I had waited to read it and was surprised by both the enthusiasm of the content and its author, but also by how he snuck in some odd biblically unsound thoughts (e.g., I gasped when he suggested Christ went to Hell...what Bible passage evidences this?).  I agree with how he suggests the enemy is out to deceive us and keep us asleep...but wonder if I go further how much more Eldredge will slip in of his own peculiar biblical misintrepretations.  Where were his editors when this was being written?  Why take sensible good sections and mar them with oddities?  I havent read all the reviews here but as one of those "conservatives" frequently mentioned in them I have to admit I may not even finish this book for fear of what else Eldredge has slipped up on.  I did appreciate his story about Daniel and the "delayed" angel...but am left wondering if I need go deeper into researching that as possible misintepretation too.  What a shame this book is turning into such a questionable venture for me.  We are at war as the author suggests and we must guard the source material well..the Bible well.  So far...I may join others and ditch this valiant attempt to energize Christians and return to the Word itself.  I wonder if I can get a refund+books
Horrible Layout+N+The content of this book is adequate, but the layout leaves much to be desired.  The only way to find a chapter is through the table of contents.  Pages are not labeled with chapter information, such as which chapter that page belongs to.  The content is often broken up with cases and excercises that divide paragraphs in half. This makes it very confusing to follow the flow of the book.  You can be reading along and jump into a case or excercise without knowing it and become very confused.  If the authors and publishers would rework the flow of the book, I would rate it much higher+books
Please be very careful!+N+This book can be very damaging if you approach it with the idea that it is absolute truth.  As some readers have complained, this is not really a "Christian" book because the focus isn't on Christ, it's on YOU.    A Biblically centered way of dating would put the focus on loving other people unconditionally, the way Jesus would, and not on trying to "find the perfect spouse."  The whole premise of the book is rather un-Christlike:  making yourself enticing enough to the opposite gender that someone would want to marry you.  It's rather selfish, really, when you consider the words of John the Baptist: "Christ must become more, I must become less," as well as the warning in Song of Solomon "Do not awaken love until it so desires."    Shouldn't our primary goal be to glorify Christ and not search for earthly shortcuts to fulfilling our desires?  Finding a spouse is not like science nor business which have clear procedures or even guidelines.  Hearts can be broken, and therefore authentic, Christlike love must take precedence.  I don't mean to sound accusing, but this book borders close to the type of manipulation that the world cleverly calls "seduction."  My brother humorously commented that the book also tries to turn you into a "poser." This happens when 'forcing yourself' to be more masculine or feminine in order to entice the opposite sex.  You have to ask:  What kind of people are you trying to attract...people who are enticed by your masculinity/femininity or people who are excited about you for who truly are?  I personally would rather a lady be attracted to me for my fruits of the spirit than my looks or personality.  It is a combination of both action and faith that is important.  Faith to set the situations up.  Action to knock em down+books
More than dated...+N+More Than Human is one of those books that has garnered high praise from the science fiction community because of its strong prose and original ideas.  The writing is often compared to that of Faulkner but I wouldn't make that connection having read a few of Faulkner's works.  Sturgeon uses many of Faulkner's narrative trademarks (i.e. streaming conscious, first person perspective of low IQ individuals, disorienting changes in first person narrative) but I didn't feel the net effect really compared to say something like As I Lay Dying.  I love science fiction books and the readers in general love the genre which is why they want it to be taken seriously.  This results in undue adulation and comparisons to mainstream books.  More Than Human is slow, dated and not what I would describe as genre transcending nor would I recommend it to others.  So the idea might of been original in the 50's but topics like telekenesis, ESP, computer-brain babies, and self produced morality and ethos have all been tackled more successfully in other science fiction classics before (Asimov) and since.  This book rarely set off that wow! button in my head or kept me turning pages.  This book simply did not have enough meat in it to make it anything more than mediocre at best.  In 1953 there were 5 Hugo Award nominees for best science fiction book (Determined in a retro hugo award ballot in 2004)  The Retro Hugo awards are fascinating because the voting (in this example) takes place 50 years later so the impact of the book on society can't really be ignored.  Besides More Than Human, the far superior The Caves Of Steel, Childhood's End, and Farenheit 451 were among the other entries in a banner year for classic sci-fi.  Needless to say, More Than Human did not win (Farenheit 451 did and rightfully so)  Bottom Line:  I wanted to like this book and it doesn't surprise me that others give it such high praise.  These are probably people that don't read other genres enjoy congratulatory wankfests+books
Too much+N+This book places too much emphasis on spending money instead of eating...well if we all had money to burn that would be a wonderful lifestyle.  Read "The Fat Fallacy" instead, it provides much more practical information+books
I guess I just don't get it.+N+I certainly agree that Portis is a talented writer, but I just didn't find him all that funny.  Perhaps I'm missing something, but I thought that the characters were strange enough, not amusing, just strange.  I was frustrated by the characters and the world that they inhabited.  I forced myself to finish the book and I was rewarded by the one funny line in the whole book, which comes at the very end of the novel+books
More entertaining than watching television+N+I can attest to the author's views, because I too have precognition, telepathy, and remote viewing ability. For example, right now I see the author counting his income from the book and laughing at the gullibility of new age readers.+books
Exploding myths about Red Hollywood+P+Remember the Hollywood blacklist? The Hollywood Ten? I'll bet you know a lot about these events even if you weren't alive in the 1950s. That's because Tinseltown has a vested interest in keeping the memory of this era alive. It was the era of the Red Scare, of Senator Joseph McCarthy waving his infamous list of communist subversives during a speech in West Virginia. It was the time of congressional investigations, a time when invoking the Fifth Amendment might keep you safe from a contempt charge but would make you look guilty as sin in the public eye. For a select few the McCarthy era was a time of great fear, and no one feared this witch-hunt against communism more than Hollywood. Why? Because, despite the mountains of claims to the contrary that have emerged over the years, the movie industry oozed communists. There were so many Reds in Hollywood that they should have renamed the town Little Moscow. Yet even today, you won't hear about this truth in the media. You will, however, get the skinny on what really went on if you pick up a copy of Ronald Radosh's "Red Star Over Hollywood: The Film Colony's Long Romance with the Left."   Talk about exploding myths! Radosh's book, which he co-wrote with his wife Allis, cuts through the layers of denial and presents us with an ugly picture of the real Hollywood of the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. Vladimir Lenin, the little pipsqueak who brought the nightmare of Marxism to the Soviet Union back in the early part of the twentieth century, had a soft spot for film and theater. He believed that the best way to spread communism around the globe was through movies and plays. This is exactly what the Kremlin crowd set out to accomplish in the following decades. They managed to gain converts to their cause--men who later became movers and shakers like Budd Schulberg, Joseph Losey, and Maurice Rapf--by allowing them to work closely with the Soviet film industry. Once these people came back to the United States, they spread their plague to others with the help of party apparatchiks Willi Munzenberg, V.J. Jerome, and John Howard Lawson. In no time at all, writes Radosh, a branch of the communist party flourished in Hollywood. So many big names signed on that newcomers to the industry, in an attempt to make contacts and find work, had to become communists or fellow travelers themselves.  The Hollywood branch of the communist party worked to increase their membership and influence in several ways. One of the most successful methods involved the tried and true "United Frontism" and "Popular Front" techniques, or the forming of organizations that on the surface embraced popular progressive causes to lure in unsuspecting liberals while maintaining strong communist control behind the scenes. Radosh reveals that the concerns many people had about the rise of National Socialist Germany in the 1930s helped increase membership, although the party's propensity to change direction, oftentimes overnight according to directives issued from the Kremlin, tended to alienate many members. Also off putting was the heavy-handed discipline that could fall on an unsuspecting member at any time. Albert Maltz, for example, discovered the inflexibility of the party when he wrote an article deemed "revisionist" by the upper hierarchy. His very public refutation of his article left little doubt about the strong-arm tactics used behind the scenes. Despite the ugliness the Hollywood Reds occasionally displayed, they were somewhat successful in spreading their propaganda through films like "Mission to Moscow," "The Spanish Earth," and "The North Star." Congressional investigations threw some of these dupes in the slammer, and silenced a few more, but many never repudiated their warped views.  I enjoyed Radosh's book, the first one of his I've had the chance to read. The author and his spouse obviously know what they're talking about and, since Ronald Radosh himself was a communist for many years, he understands how these groups think and act. "Red Star Over Hollywood" occasionally suffers from dry prose and a bewildering number of groups and individuals, but the authors always manage to bring the book back up to speed by throwing in some great anecdotes. For instance, the part where we learn about Ronald Reagan (at the time a liberal) and his buddy William Holden crashing a communist get together in an attempt to inject some common sense into the proceedings is great fun to read about. Reagan got up and started talking only to find himself under verbal attack for some forty minutes. God bless him! The account of Albert Maltz's forced rehabilitation is absolutely chilling, a sobering tale that hints at the violent tendencies inherent in communism. Arguably the best part of the book, however, involves the long, strange trip writer Dalton Trumbo took from the time of his blacklisting to his repudiation of the communist party later in life.  So many intriguing stories pop up in the book that the actual creation of the blacklist takes a backseat.  I have one recommendation and one warning to those readers about to attempt the book. In the case of the former, if you're not very familiar with this time period, read a background history of the Red Scare first. Doing so will assist you in learning the context for what happens here and help you learn the basics about a few of the groups and personalities associated with the blacklist. In the case of the latter, the topic is so huge that Radosh doesn't have the space to cover many of the important Reds. There is almost nothing here about Lillian Hellman or Dashiell Hammett, for example, and both of those individuals had a lot to do with the influence of communism in film and books. Nevertheless, this book is well worth your time. Read it and remember it the next time Hollywood releases yet another "we were innocent" propaganda piece.     +books
not good science+N+while I appreciate what Tipler was attempting to accomplish, he fails miserabley both from a theological and a scientific perspective.  skip this one!+books
A disappointment+N+Some of the Reacher novels--such as The Killing Floor--have been incredibly good, but I was genuinely disappointed in this one.  The author describes Reacher as heroic, a loner, etc., but instead he should write in such a way that we reach these insights without being told.  Phrases, such as "back in the day," get repeated much too often.  Reacher has become a caricature of himself+books
Huge Disappointment+N+The others in the series were great, and I really looked forward to A Breath of Snow and Ashes. It read like it was all Gabaldon's discarded notes for the previous installment.  I felt really cheated to have spent my time and money on this book. +books
Disapppointing+N+A few good things, but she's lost her edge AND I find it impossible to identify AT ALL with women who regularly have themselves stitched up here and there, Botoxed, massaged, PT-ed...  Plus I've never made $150,000+ per year so I feel like I live in another cosmos.  Besides, I live in France, where real faces are appreciated.  constance rodrigu+books
Do not buy this book+N+Words cannot describe how ripped off and disappointed I feel about buying this book.   Having read RDPD and CFQ in the Kiyosaki range previously and finding them great, I thought this book would be great as well. I'm sorry to say it's the worst book I've ever read. The entire book is a blatant sales brochure for all his other books.   There's all these annoying references where you get a little bit of information and then instructions that if you want to know more, you need to buy one of his other books. I didn't get any useful information and it's certainly not a 'how to' book. I thought I would be reading about him and his wife's story but all I got was the same few points said over and over again. He doesn't even try to say them in a different way.  The other annoying thing was his promotion of network marketing as a good business option. It was obviously done to help sweeten the deal he has with the network marketing association who recommend all his books to their members.   I could seriously go on and on about why you shouldn't waste your money on this book but I won't.  I have NEVER written a book review on amazon before as I have never felt so strongly about a book. I generally feel if I get even just 1 thing out of reading a book then it was well worth it. In this case I didn't get anything out of it and felt really used and taken advantage of which is why I decided to post this review.   I hope it saves someone else from wasting their money. Buying this book WILL NOT HELP YOU RETIRE YOUNG OR RETIRE RICH+books

Too popular to bother trying anymore.+N+J.K. Rowling successfully put me off this book series within the first two chapters of this book.  The characters personalities were wavering in book 5, in this they completely vanished or mutated.  I'll only be getting the 7th one because it's the last one and I've read this far so I might as well go the whole way.   In books one through four the trio of Harry, Ron, and Hermione were loveable characters tenaciously and cleverly seeking out the answers to the mysteries that came up each year and saving the day.  Book 5 had them doing more angsting and screaming than mystery solving, and more whining than day saving. Book 6 made them stand in paper doll doing a bad job miming the motions the real characters would have done.  This book Harry seemed to care more about romance.  A very poorly done romance littered with cheezy phrases and romantic moments on par with the worst of bad fanfiction; which had no background or build up from previous books.  A female character from the background, whom Harry barely even notices all through the past five books, is suddenly the most perfect and beautiful girl in the school in mary-sue fashion.  Several other characters in both the foreground and background were also unfortunately treated to Rowlings amature attempts at romance, none of which bore any revelance to plot or story.  Harry also had a significant decline in morality and intelligence.  The clever boy who put clues together with his friends now cheats in one of his classes and makes one stupid mistake after another.  The image of Harry that stuck with me and seemed to glare off the pages every time he spoke or did anything was of him lying, frozen in a curled position on the floor of the train with blood coming out of his broken nose, under his invisibility cloak and rolling around with the trains motion after a particularly stupid episode with Malfoy.  As to the general plot of the book.  Poorly done.  Continually backstaged by sickeningly done romance and angst it barely made an impression on me.  Most of the 'revealations' in the book revealed nothing not already known or obvious from old information, and the culmination of what Harry was not-quite-solving didn't amount to anything.  My final opinion: Don't bother to read past book 4 if you're just starting the series and care anything at all about characterization.  A very disappointing book+books
Great book!+P+I suggest this book to anyone who wants to, or are thinking of, delving into C - no matter how deep!  What I love about this book is that it's good for a non-motivated person like me as well, because the exercises at the end of each chapter really make me wanting to finish them up (sort of like how teacher used to make us do it in high school.) If you think you already know the material of a chapter, then just skip to the exercises and try to see if you can do those - if you can, then just continue on. If you can't, then simply check over the chapter again to re-test your knowledge+books
Obsolete+N+This book completely fails to realistically convey the relative risks and profit potential for the average wannabe day trader.  Im talking about someone with less than a few thousand to play the market.  Unless you have big bucks and Level II quotes forget day trading unless you are very lucky. In the trading parlance, I wish I had a short position on this book at its current price, and could cover my short at the current used price! Save your money+books
The Globalization of Guilt+N+1. The persective of most writers is shaped by their own experience. Dr.Steele is an American Black, a baby boomer, a member of the academic elite, a liberal arts major, and a political "conservative".This certainly affects his perpective when he discusses social issues.  2. I felt that he was on pretty solid ground and made some good points when he was telling about his own experiences growing up in a segregated America and during the civil rights movement. His take on the psychological hangover after the 1964 passage of Civil Rights legislation regarding the attempts by the white power structure to regain "moral authority" by doing GOOD....and the black power advocates ready acceptance of those attempts... helps explain some of the dysfunctional after- effects that are still with us.   3. Where I disagree with his analysis - speaking from my own experience and perspective of course - is that he takes the race issue which he says has been pretty well settled in the US and then blows it all out of proportion by saying that white guilt is the underlying cause of nearly every difficult social issue in the last 50 years! And he blames the "dissociating liberals" (whoever they are) for attempting to deal with these social issues. Excuse me, but I recall Nixon and the Reaganites being in power for awhile and the Bush dynasty is still with us and I haven't seen a lot of effort being done to get-together and fix things for average folks here in the good ole US of A. Of course pressing the GUILT button in this mainly Judeo-Christian culture is a sure fire way to get everyones attention.  4. My point is that by injecting  blatant partisanship into the discourse he took a premise that people of all persuasions might coalesce around and instead divides us even further.His statement about Red and Blue States was a hoot! How is this helpful? Where are his suggestions for improvement - other than that he thinks Bush & Co. now have the "moral authority" that has been so lacking in America? Some might be inclined to disagree.  5. Finally, as a black Dr. Steele misreads me as a white liberal in that I have never felt guilty about my white heritage - only ashamed for the historically extremely dysfunctional behavior of many of our fellow humans - themselves victims of misbegotten religious dogma.If we stop trying to improve our world just because we make mistakes in the process.........and if we fail to learn the lessons of the past,we will be condemned to repeat them or be blown into outer space.Not a happy prospect for this social progressive and fiscal conservative.+books
After All These Years, Still Applicable+P+This decades old book will probably go down as one of the most successful books ever. The ideas contained within are certainly valid for any age.  This book is about sensitivity, not sensitivity to the weeping child, but the sensitivity required to maintain a successful business. This books speaks about being not only sensitive to your customers, but being sensitive to your employees, a major problem with many companies finding it difficult to survive.  Actions speak louder than words, everyone knows it, hardly anybody does it. Empowerment, give people the means and freedom to shine. Listen, quit trying to teach the world, let the world teach you. Keep things simple, simplicity allows for focus and leads to success. Easy concepts to understand, not so easy to apply. This book is about principles.  It could certainly be argued that most of the advice given in this book is anecdotal, but this fact is also why it has lasted this long as a viable text. Those that want to argue this point are usually the same individuals that don't understand the principals and don't apply them, hence why they need this the most. Sure, most people intuitively know these principles, but how many need reminded?  People are moved more by general concepts that are flexible enough to be applied to most situations. This book provides just that+books
Unethcial, immoral, impractical+N+This book teaches people the unethical way to advertise on the internet - spamming.  Following these methods, at worse, will put you in legal trouble. At best, you will be making money unethically and making lots of people angry.  These stupid get rich quick internet schemes don't work anyways... don't waste your time or money+books
Another good book+P+Not sure if this is the last book in the series or not. It ends abruptly. However, it was a good book to read, so 4 stars. I had Artemis Fowl, and 2 Charlie Bone books at the same time. I read all, but my kids dropped Charlie in favor of Artemis. Hence the 4 stars. As usual, the series becomes somewhat predictable - evil always bullies, good never seems strong enough to resist, some unknown char has to help them out+books
The Amazing Mr. Franklin+N+Excellent book on the life of Benjamin Franklin.  He certainly was a genius and full of surprizes+books
Excellent Book for those looking for hope+P+I read this book several years ago and it has been  very importan not only in my personal growth as well as being a book I highly recommend for my clients.  Borysenko's ability to write in a profound meaning manner, while  not resorting to technical language.. makes this and other books by her  accessible for laymen.  If you would like to find a light out of the  &quot;dark nights of the soul&quot;, this is the book to read+books
Misleading+N+I have been a huge fan of Michael Crichton for about 25 years.  However, this book is misleading and dangerous.  Almost every respectable scientist in the world now agrees that global warming is real and that we are greatly accelerating this problem (except some scientists affiliated with the petroleum and automobile industries).    Writing a book that disputes global warming would be like writing a book that disputes the holocaust - Mr. Crichton could just as easily have written a book about how the holocaust did not really happen, and provide plenty of "references" to support this premise.  Tragically, in the long term, global warming could be far more destructive than even the holocaust.    I hope that someday Mr. Crichton recognizes that, in addition to his enormous talent for entertaining, he has enormous influence on people's thoughts and actions through his books.  There is a quote: "With great power comes great responsibility."  But in this case it would seem: "With great power comes great profit at the expense of the planet.+books
A Three Hundred Page Sleeping Pill+N+I was given three months to read this book, and each time I picked it up I threw it down in disgust.  Between the none-stop Johnny Appleseed referances to the Collegian's Guide to Growing Pot, it is amazing I got through it.  I am convinced he was once a Columbian drug lord+books
A Primer on Iraq+P+I saw Dr. Polk on C-SPAN a month or two ago.  He was addressing a gathering of concerned and apparently well-heeled citizens in the New York Museum of Art--as I recall.  He had the crowd and the moderator in the palm of his hands.  I found him to be a compelling speaker who obviously was very versed in the subject matter of Iraq.  He seemed to genuinely care about the Iraqi people--and the Amercian people.  His speech and this book was about correcting our "present march of folly"--to steal from Barbara Tuchman's fine book title.  This book is a primer on Iraq from Dr. Polk's point of view.  It does offer a "broad sweep" of Iraqi history in a mere 200+ pages.  It's purpose is obviously as an introductory historical primer for literate, reasonably educated Americans so that they can understand the basic historical circumstances leading up to the present conflict.  I think he wrote the book to try to change more American minds and effect a change in our present policy.  That change seems to be coming about as I hit these keys.  Both the Iraqi public and American public seem to be losing patience with the present intolerable set of affairs in Iraq.  It's quite unfortunate that some of the Amazon reviewers have so much trouble accepting some very basic facts.  They, like the occupant of the White House and the rather motley crew that surrounds him seem to live in their own separate reality.  We need, as a people, to give up our collective fairy tales about our country, its leaders, and its forever "good intentions."    This is a very approachable book.  Highly recommended for those who have little background in the history of Iraq.  Another very good book that another reviewer recommended is:  "The Future of Iraq" by Liam Anderson and Gareth Stansfield.  Their analysis results in the conclusion that Iraq will break into 3 pieces.  Hopefully, in some sort of federated pattern rather than as warring nations.  I remember Seymour Hirsch saying that the three part outcome was virtually inevitable given the circumstances on the ground in Iraq.  He based this on his sources in Iraq.  He made this statement in the spring on C-SPAN.  Seems quite prescient. +books
Different than Rise to Rebellion, but still very, very good.+P+'The Glorious Cause' is the second in Shaara's two volume piece historical fiction concerning the Revolutionary War. 'Rise to Rebellion' was the first, and I believe the superior of the two, but 'The Glorious Cause' is an excellent novel as well.  'Rise to Rebellion' was the superior of the two novels due to the changes of heart that the readers sees in John Adams and Benjamin Franklin concerning the issue of independence from England. 'The Glorious Cause' has little of that type deep soul-searching. However, it is a fantastic portrayal of the difficulties encountered by the Continental Army and George Washington, in particular.  If I were to have my druthers, I would have preferred that Shaara had broken this 600+ page novel into two novels and expanded them both by delving more into the politics of the day and the difficulties of fighting a war with the governmental structures and restrictions that the Contintenal Congress was hampered with.   In addition, more battles and fronts could have been explored, such as the ill-fated American invasion of Canada and Benedict Arnold's naval adventures on Lake Champlain.  That being said, these are still a highly recommended novels - either for the American Revolution novice or the enthusiast.   Well done, Mr. Shaara+books
This one will keep your kids interested!+P+Great book!  We had the 2006 edition for my 7-year-old son last year and he couldn't wait to get his hands on the new 2007.  He takes it to school for free reading time and all of the kids love it.  Even our friend's 12-year-old says it's very popular among that age group as well.  It's great because it has something for everyone, is educational, and the sections can be read in short sittings.  The cover is almost worn out because he takes it everywhere.  We now give this book as gifts all the time+books
What happened to Tim Curry?+N+My daughter and I had listened to the first two audio books, "The Bad Beginning" and "The Reptile Room", both narrated by Tim Curry, so we were very disappointed by "The Wide Room." Tim Curry was a fabulous narrator, why did they not continue to use him? His voice has just the right quality of evil mischief to it, and as an actor he really brought the book to life. Often, the person who wrote the book is not the best person to read it and this is the case with Lemony Snicket. His whiney, lispy voice was so bad it was a distraction. Curry's fabulous, velvety voice oozed malice and delight and the loss of him was a loss to the quality of the story. Lemony Snicket narrating his own story is truly an "Unfortunate Event!+books
A different sort of Heinlein book+P+After reading many of the reviews here, I note that opinion seems divided on whether it's truly a good Heinlein book or not. Most still consider it a pretty fair Heinlein yarn, and yet all the reviews I read missed one of the main points of the novel--which is the main reason why it's so interesting--whether it's a great Heinlein novel or not.  Many have already commented on the various themes of the book, most of which will already be familiar to Heinlein fans. The one that was new was the bigotry against the main character, an artificial and genetically enhanced human. It seems most readers found this reaction unlikely, although this theme pervades the entire work. One reviewer asserts that it's even the primary idea of the whole book.   Another important theme is the revolt against authority which many Heinlein readers will certainly know from his other books such as The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, Double Star, Citizen of the Galaxy, Stranger in a Strange Land, Sixth Column, Revolt in 2100, and others.  The theme of the competent man also takes center stage in this book, another famous and familiar Heinlein theme, although in this book it's a competent, genetically enhanced female.  However, all these interpretations, although true, miss one very important point. In Heinlein's novels, the world is often a very unstable and even dangerous place--but there is always hope, and optimism that conditions will be better in the future. Often the main characters in Heinlein's books are intimately involved in this struggle to overthrow oppressive governments--and usually succeeding, thereby creating a better life for themselves.  So no matter how precarious and dark life in the present might be, Heinlein always had hope for the future and seemed confident that humans would throw off the yoke of oppression, establish a better society, and basically good would win out over evil. But in this novel, he appears to have at least partly, perhaps substantially, abandoned that hope in favor of a much darker, more dismal, and depressing future for humanity, at least on earth. Better prospects can be found off-planet on several newly colonized worlds.  The evidence for this isn't hard to find, but is scattered throughout the book in various narratives, and in conversations between Friday and her boss, Dr. Baldwin. By the way, Kettle Belly Baldwin has not appeared, to my knowledge, in another Heinlein book since Gulf, published in 1949. However, all of the other characters are new. So one of the charms of the book is that one gets to meet a lot of new characters, making this book different from almost all of Heinlein's later output, and an old but memorable character is brought back to life in a new context.  But getting back to my point, Heinlein makes it clear the earth is economically and politically deteriorating, with most of the world now completely Balkanized into hundreds of small, petty states, each with its own unpleasant idiosyncrasies. Heinlein says most of these small states are faceless ciphers, with a few larger, powerful states remaining.   The U.S. is no different, being divided into several smaller sovereign states, along with Canada. But these smaller states are often co-belligerants or are at war with each other. It's said that peace rarely lasts more than a month. In one coup that occurs in the Chicago Imperium by militant Republicans, Democrats are rounded up and executed--including their children down to the age of 14.  Another alarming idea is that the large international corporations, such as IBM or the Shipstone Corp., are also participants and instigators of these wars, and sometimes wipe out entire cities, such as Acapulco. These corporations are hard to fight, since they have no single geographical location, and in the book, the internationals seem to be winning over the real or geographically "localized" countries. These super corporations are completely ruthless and immoral and killing for hire and mass murder by them are common.  Heinlein holds out little hope the situation will ever improve--he sees elected officials as venal and corrupt parasites feeding at the public trough and mouthing fatuous platitudes for consumption by an impotent and perhaps naive public--a much darker and more cynical interpretation of politics than that portrayed in Starship Troopers, The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, or Double Star, in which, if I remember correctly, one character remarks that politics is the only game a mature man can take any pleasure in.  Even con artists and grifters Heinlein sees as more noble--at least they're hardworking independents who aren't on the dole and are trying to earn an "honest" living. :-)  Government and personal corruption are also ubiquitous. The police are not to be trusted in the book, and disposing of them if possible is considered a good idea--as long as one can get away with it, of course. For a client who is powerful and wealthy enough, even physicians can be made to arrange for a certain patient to "die" on the operating table. In fact, almost no one in any position of authority--except Friday's boss, Baldwin, seems to be trustworthy.  In conversations with her boss, Dr. Baldwin, he tells Friday she needs to get off planet because of what's happening on earth and asks her how one can tell if a society is truly sick--that being when normal conventions of politeness and manners have deteriorated into rudeness--which the people now take as a sign of strength. In the book, the good people always seem to be on the run and are persecuted--while the evil flourish unhindered. An epidemic of cholera or bubonic plague that could kill millions is predicted, possibly because of a conspiracy. But Baldwin sees this as a social good since cities are so overpopulated and dysfunctional already that thinning out the population--however it is achieved--is a worthwhile goal.  So overall, it seems a darker and more pessimistic future than anything Heinlein had ever imagined up to this time. But one of Heinlein's strengths is his ability to create believable alternate realities--which again comes through here--however dark and depressing it might be. Whether it's one of his greatest books or not, I think it counts as an unusual and worthwhile Heinlein book because of that+books
Lost in a great book!+P+I am an avid fan of Lost and found this book to be a great resource, as well as a starting point for some new thought on the subject.  There is a lot to keep track of in this TV series (characters' current lives on the island, flashbacks to characters' previous lives, plot twists, philosophy. . .etc)  and the details that are catalogued in this book have been revelatory to me.  Having all those details laid out in front of me has helped me to think about my own and others' theories on Lost and make some interesting connections and even some dismissals.  This book is for the thinking fan who wants an accessible resource and insightful discussion of an incredible series.  I have also loaned this book to a friend who I wanted to get interested in Lost, and she has found it most helpful and is now HOOKED on the series.  There is also a section on fansites and blog resources that has been really fun to peruse. I have even run into one of the authors online and gotten to chat. Very cool!  In short, this book has it all!+books
I  LOST CHROMOSOMES READING THIS BOOK!+N+I don't know what to say about this book. It is the single worst book I have ever read in my young life.  I feel like I've witnessed a horrible tragedy and am at a loss for words to describe it.  I would say at some point in the book, maybe about halfway, every line of dialogue, every characterization, every plot point, is absolutely terrible.  This book is truly an offense to literacy, and I cannot understand how a publisher of any merit or author could publish and print this trash.  I can only imagine that Robin Cook either allowed a child to write this book,or was chronically drunk while writing it. Either that or he has lost his faculties altogether. I have read children's essays that have been better written. While it would take a novel to explain all the problems with this book, the highlights are: -knowing the mystery 50 pages into the book and being forced to painfully watch the dumb characters discover the mystery -cliche mania with lines like, "I going to get to the bottom of this mystery" and when the character's discover something, giving each other high-fives. -racist remarks about blacks living in harlem about how they like to steal televisions, own guns, and play basketball. -stereotype characters such as mafioso that like to eat spaghetti and named dominick and vinny. -incredible suspension of disbelief when the heros, nyc coroners, fly off to africa on a moments notice because they want to finish their case of a dead body. (also paying for their friends to come too) -wandering around the main installation easily where the evildoers are working, and asking questions, and getting answers to them real easy. -incredible annoying characters that make inappropriate jokes. (i.e. making sarcastic remarks to a guy holding a gun on them) -the book spirals into total madness in the last 50 pages to a beyond implausible ending. I got a sense whoever wrote the end of book was on sleeping pills when he wrote it. If anyone thinks this book is better than two stars, they need their head examined.+books
awful!+N+Thank god I got this from the library and didn't buy it.  It's terrible.  And the ending is so abrupt I turned the next page expecting to read more and was shocked that the book was over.  The sex is icky and there's little else in the book+books
Amazing book+P+I acutally read the entire book unlike almost all of the people who gave this book a bad rating.  Ann Coulter is a Conservative genius.  She pokes holes in the liberal agenda like no one else.  She is intelligent, and makes very good arguements.  The only reason this book got 4 stars instead of 5 is because the last chapter was a bit dull.  This is some of her earlier writing, and therefore was not the best.  She should have put this chapter closer to the beginning, so it wouldn't be the last thing the reader remembers.    Other than the last chapter, this book is filled with great humor, while still being informative and making her arguements.  She includes some publisher notes from her articles to show that the media does have a liberal bias (even though they say they don't)...this book should be on everyone's must read list!!+books
Readalbe but junky+N+Timeline is equivalent to a 99 cent taco. It's an indulgent bit of junk food. Timeline starts with a Hillerman-esque scientist turning up in the middle of New Mexico - an intriguing idea, but goes to the land of mediocracy right after that filled with cartoon characters. There are so many preposterous story elements that it's just really difficult to take seriously. The story is ever-predictable and ludicrous. But, a 99 cent taco is worth the effort if you're real hungry. Go back and read Andromeda Strain.+books
I wouldn't recommend this book... lacks credibility.+N+In his book, The Four Agreements, Don Miguel Ruiz, embodies four principles for experiencing personal freedom in life.  He says that we should be impeccable with our words, not to take anything personally, don't make assumptions, and to always do our best. The basis for some of the agreements we make with ourselves stem from early childhood training through a series of rewards and punishments from our parents.  He calls this process "domestication" (p. 6). Ruiz says that 95% of the beliefs we hold are nothing but lies and that most of our agreements are based upon the fear of rejection.  The agreements that he gives are meant to free us from the emotional bonds that get in the way of our personal energy and to transform our lives.  While there are various nuggets of truth throughout the book, some of it goes off into the abyss where he takes a thought and carries it to what I would consider to be to be an illogical conclusion. In some instances he uses biblical scripture to support his claims; however, in looking further, he takes some of the passages from the Bible out of context.  Some of his ideas are presented as if they were new ideas, but I would think most of us by a young age, should already an understanding of these principles. Although his book has been highly rated, I hold the position that Mr. Ruiz lacks credibility and logic as a writer, therefore, losing good standing with me as a reader.  According to Ruiz, as children we are not given the opportunity to choose our own beliefs.  When we go against the rules we are punished (or rewarded for compliance). The fear of rejection leads us to agree with, or become something that we are not. In essence, we become a carbon copy of someone else, such as our parents.  He says our normal tendencies are lost and we judge other people based upon these agreements.  He boldly states, lacking statistical data to back it up, that 95% of our beliefs are based upon a lie (13).  The implication is that we are merely nothing more than a society of mindless, "domesticated" individuals, hurting ourselves, judging and victimizing other people along the way.  This kind of thinking negates the teachings associated with parenthood and the positive aspects they bring to our lives. By his interpretation, if 95% of what we believe is a lie, then 95% of what our parents taught us is also a lie.  I would disagree.  There are many people who exist today as viable, productive members of society who I'm sure would point out they too became a copy of someone else's beliefs and values.  If these role models are only filling our heads with lies and teaching us how not to be ourselves, by his interpretation, we don't need parents, teachers, or leaders. He undermines our personal paradigms and omits that as adults we do have the ability to choose a different path, which I believe is our right of passage. By his rational we lose the ability to choose our own destiny.  Instead, we become victims of it.    One of the few things we agree upon is his first agreement, be impeccable with your word; however, he misquotes the bible (John 1:1) when he says "In the beginning was the word and the word was with God, and the word was God."  He uses it to epitomize the use of "word" as in what one speaks (26).  Looking a little further down in that passage, it also says "The word was made flesh and dwelt among us".  This passage is not talking about a form of speech, or speaking, but rather "Jesus Christ".  Christ became flesh and dwelt among us.  In that same chapter he says that "sin begins with rejection of yourself" (31).  However, in Christianity it says that sin is a transgression of the law (1 John 3:4) and that sin is neglecting to do God's will (James 4:7).  It's not about self, but about disobeying God's ordinances. While I agree that watching what we say is something we all need to strive for, this is not a new concept.  Most children have learned by the age of 6 that if you don't have something nice to say, don't say it at all.  In his second agreement, don't take anything personally; he says that nothing people do is because of you. While this is true to some degree, he leads the reader down a path of illogical extremes when he says that even if someone took a gun and shot you in the head, it was nothing personal.  So in essence, when Mary Jo Buttafuoco was shot by Amy Fisher, her expression of displeasure regarding Amy's behavior was nothing more than a fundamental form of projection because according to Ruiz "you are dealing with yourself, not me" (51).  No, realistically, Mary Jo Buttafuoco was shot because Amy Fisher wanted her dead. This kind of logic encourages victims to remain in dysfunctional relationships and perpetrators to continue abusing victims.  As an American, I'm glad that someone took 9/11 personally.   According to Mr. Ruiz he takes neither destructive nor constructive criticism.  It seems arrogant to place myself so far above reproach, that I would turn a deaf ear to all forms of criticism.  When my College writing professor, gave me his opinion regarding my work, if I were following the authors line of reasoning, I would believe that my professor was "trying to poison my mind and was feeding me his emotional garbage" as Mr. Ruiz suggests (49). I would rather believe that my instructor has my best interests at heart and is seeking to teach me how to become a better writer.  Another agreement is about not making assumptions in life.  He says when we make assumptions, in essence, we create unnecessary drama.  Unfortunately we live in a world where that is not entirely possible.  Assumption is a necessary part of a thought and reason; even within the scientific community a hypothesis (or assumption) is formed in order to test a theory.  In order come to school each day I must make assumptions that my instructor has a college degree, and that he or she must be reliable enough in life to make it to work everyday.  In his forth agreement, always do your best, he claims it is based upon the actions of the other three agreements, stating they will only work if you do your best.  Again, these are fundamental principles that almost any child has learned.    While Ruiz does indeed present some viable ideas, his concepts begin to unravel when he doesn't back up his statements with facts, but instead takes a basic concept and follows an illogical line of reasoning to reach his final conclusion.  I can't completely discount everything that he says, but he lost credibility with me by some of his assumptions and weak rationalizations.+books
Boycott Robert G. Allen!!!+N+Robert G. Allen is a notorious and relentless internet spammer.  If you should happen to somehow end up on one of his email lists like I did, he will send you several junk emails a day.  Unsubscribing doesn't work, and trying to block the sender's domain is useless because the emails are sent from a different domain every time.  The funny part is that the emails aren't even coded properly.  They always show up as just a bunch of html code.  Would you really take internet money-making advice from a guy who can't even code html properly?  Anyway, his spamming practices are completely illegal and it's only a matter of time before the law catches up with him.  But that shouldn't come as any surprise considering that mister Allen has been in trouble with the law before.  He's had several run-ins with the IRS, lawsuits against him, and a chapter 7 bankruptcy.  I would also stay away from his Nothing Down real estate methods.  Many of those practices are illegal, and the president of the Nothing Down club in Atlanta wound up in federal prison because of it.  For more info on Allen, visit johntreed dottcomm, click on Real Estate Investing, then click Real Estate Guru Ratings.  Bottom line, don't trust this guy and don't buy his books. And if you're reading this Mr. Allen, take me off your @%#&*$ mailing list!!+books
As good as it gets+P+I haven't finished it.  In fact, I'm not a quarter through it; but Stephen has not written better - Salem's Lot, Dark Tower I, Shining, Misery.  For a person who was going to quit, he reached deep inside and grabbed something truely special.  Gary+books
Historically important, but can't stand on its own.+N+This book is important for the historian who wishes to get a glimpse into the workings of the mind of an important figure in American Revolutionary history, but it doesn't stand on its own. It is written almost entirely as a response to Edmund Burke's "Reflections on the Revolution in France", so I would not recommend reading this one until and unless one has read that one. Otherwise, it is impossible to judge the fairness of the rebuttals of Burke's points, as one only sees them through Paine's perspective, and Paine is far from a fair and impartial debater; he misses no opportunity to belittle his opponent's arguments, and even his opponent himself. I would not be at all surprised to discover that he gives an inaccurate picture of what Burke had to say, particularly given that history speaks rather better of Burke's misgivings than of Paine's panegyrics. Both books were written before the Reign of Terror that resulted from the revolution in 1793; the second part of this book came out in early 1792. Also, history shows us just how silly some of Paine's claims for a Republican, representative government are: 200+ years of representative government in the US have hardly banished wars, or the high taxes associated with them, even though the world as a whole is far more democratic than it was at his time. He makes some good points, and certainly it is hard to stand up against him in favor of hereditary monarchy, but it is apparent that he failed to see that not ALL "democratic" movements were necessarily benificent, even if it would be hard to have much sympathy for the autocratic regime that they overthrow+books
Fantasic- best book i have ever read!+P+this is my first stephen king book, well first and a half i guess, i got halfway through dreamcatcher and completely lost interest, so i started this.  I started this book 3 months ago, reading it only once or twice a week, but gradually i started to read it more and more.  I have spent the last week reading it non-stop, i just finished it about 20 minutes ago.  Anyways, this is a great book, i found it especially fascinating because it is a story about 3 kids in their late teens(and of course a killer car) and me being a teenager, natrually loved this book.  From the first sentance to the last, i had full interest.  I found i could relate to the characters quite often.    It starts off with long time best-friends Arnie Cunningham and Dennis Guidler.  While driving home from work ( maybe it was on the way to work) Arnie spots a run down garabage '58 plymouth and instantly falls in love.  He buys the car from a bitter old man named Roland LeBay(little did i kno that LeBay plays such a big part in the book).  Throughout the book, Arnie spends his time with non-other than Christine(the name of the car), until he starts going out with the preetiest girl in school.  Arnie starts to change at this point. He is no longer the biggest nerd in school, and he is changing both physically and mentally.  But pretty soon the car starts to take over his life, and take the lives of others. This book is all about a love triangle(or in this case quadrilateral) between Arnie, Leigh(arnies girlfriend), Dennis and Christine.  I recommend this book 100%. I was actually a little afraid to read the ending of it, because I HATED the end of dreamcathcer( i watched the movie after reading half of the book) and I was not to crazy about the last 20 minutes of IT(the movie, I have yet to read the book), but this book had the best ending (in my opinion) of any book I have ever read. Trust me, you will not be disappointed+books
G is for Gumshoe+N+The second tape does not move backwards or forwards. I am very diappointed+books
Loved it...+P+I loved this book.  The pacing was perfect, the characters well-drawn, and the writing style engaging.  Mickey Haller, the Lincoln lawyer of the title, and protagonist, is a hustler who works out of the back seat of one of his Lincolns.  He gets embroiled in a case that should be a real money maker.  The author uses this background to set up a very believable ethical dilemma that makes this novel a very compelling read.  This is the first Michael Connelly book I've read, but based on this one, I'm going back to read his others+books
Not the best book+N+This book is about Dave's late high school years, while he was in the foster care system.  This book talks about some friends that have helped him through some tough times.  I thought this book would talk more about his experiences and feelings about the foster care system, which we were initially led to believe.  But the book turned out to be more of a "guy" book, talking about his adventures and mishaps with his friends.  This might be interesting to teenage boys, but for a broader audience, this book didn't seem as interesting.  The experiences in foster care didn't really seem to come through as much.  The book seemed to ramble on and on about certain points and seemed to go off in a tangent at times.  As a result, the book became a little boring.  I also didn't care for some of the foul language in the book, which to me, often detracts from the point that the book is trying to get across.  About the review from the lady from New Zealand...it was not necessary to single me out in your review.  The point of these reviews is to review the book, not the reviewers.    Secondly, I did not like the book.  Plain and simple.  That is OK.  Not every book jives with everybody.  I don't feel that people who are grateful for the simple pleasures in life are boring.  I said that the book itself was boring and to me, it seemed to lose focus.  You do not have to agree with me, as I don't agree with you.  I am free to express my opinions on these books.  And yes, I read "Lost Boy", but the book initially led me to believe that it would have more in it about the foster care time period in Dave's life.  You see, I was in 3 foster homes as a kid, and to me, reading about foster care experiences from other people is always interesting to me.  So please, just focus your reviews on the books, not on the reviewers.  I had a legitimate opinion on the book and I expressed it.  I'm sure I'll lose helpful votes on what I've just said to "Gingerwoman", but it's important that we focus on reviewing books and not each other+books
Don't Bother with this one+N+Life is too short to be spent reading drivel.  Stuart Woods was really off the mark with this book.  You shouldn't rest on your laurels Mr. Woods, your audience deserves better.  I've enjoyed your past books very much, but this one left a lot to be desired.  I was very put off by Stone Barrington's bed-hopping activities in this story.  With Arrington (mother of his son) one night, then with Holly the next, I don't recall him being quite that indescriminate in other books.  The plot was relly silly and contrived, it must have been that the publisher was pressing for a story, never mind quality.  Don't waste your money on this one+books
Don't waste your money...+N+...you can waste your time and save your money by checking this out of your local library.  If you want to get an "inside view" of the inner workings of Wall Street during the excessive gyrations of the '80s, then read Den of Theives - that book is well written and well worth the money!  What turned me off about this book was the structure and the writing style.  The first half of the book was essentially the author relating fortuitous circumstances that were the product of Serendipity.  He was simply in the right place at the right time, had virutally no idea how he got there, felt out of place the whole time (even when he was raking in the Big Bucks in NY and London), and so now he thought he'd wwrite a book about it.  I also got the sense that he was trying to assuage some guilt from his association at Salomon Brothers.  He was there, he made a lot of money, good for him - get over it!  I was also pretty disappointed because the subject matter has A LOT more potential.  I might have actually enjoyed it - had I not read Den of Theives 7 years earlier, and already had some idea of how things took place.  But, if you can get it for $5 or less (including shipping), and you have little to no knowledge of what an investment banker's life is like (and you haven't also seen the movie Wall Street (which covers the same highlights in this book)), then it's probably worth it.  I did like the wrap up he did towards the end of the book, relating where he had heard everyone from the firm ended up...althought that seemed a little rushed..+books
Suitable for fresh employees+N+I was disappointed with this book after reading all the rave reviews others had submitted.  Carolyn touched on a wide range of topics briefly, and most of her advice would be applicable to people fresh out of school, as those who have already been working for a while would have encountered those situations and found a way to manage them by now+books
Best Valuation Tool Available+P+Pratt took his many years of valuation experience and put it in this one book.  The book reviews the theory and practice of how to derive a discount rate for use in a DCF.  At present, it's the best book in print for appraisers+books
Does strategic thinking impact innovation ?+P+The way you think in the lab and the office really can directly impact innovation.  Even though this book was written about business, I have learned how to reapply its lessons to innovation - specifically Kenichi helps to define and measure success and define the "deliverables" or "outputs" that innovation has to produce in order to become a reality.  Kenichi has a clear description of the biggest factors (the 3 C's) impacting your success in business - the company, the competition,and the customer/consumer.  If you look at innovation in this context, Kenichi is actually also helping us innovators define "what success looks like": the product/technology the company makes, how technically different or better it is than competitive benchmarks or alternatives in the marketplace, and whether conusmers like it and want it.  On the projects I have worked on, advised others on, or simply observed the ones that make consistently hit at least all 3 of these deliverables and often additional deliverables to. Those that fall short of all 3 consistently fail.  Hope this helps scientists, managers, entrepreneurs, and anyone with a creative or problem solving mind.

Exceptionally Dense and Clear+P+Highly recommended for personal insights. Densely packed with information clarifying difficult concepts.  This book will give you some clear insights into things you may not have received along the way and how to get past those. Although it is thin, the book has an incredibly large amount of information in it. This is the kind of book you will read the first time with an expression of "Wow" on your face. It will then be something that you will be drawn back to read again and again.  Even if you don't feel you "missed anything" along the way, the books insights and examples will provide great insights to you. It will provide great understanding of the self and others, therefore anyone can benefit from reading it.  If you liked Fromm's The Art Of Loving you will love this book as well. The premise of this book being, we are all gifted and it is up to us to reclaim that understanding.  EXCELLENT self-help material+books
This book was terrific+P+I loved it and look forward to more of her books.   The lead character was very likable and it was fun watching her journey through the break-up and divorce and how she was able to cope.

Don't waste your money+N+This book, the author and his company is a joke. Don't waste your money+books
Difficult Conversations+P+No one likes difficult conversations, but we must have them. This book guides you in dealing positively with these situations and conversations to make the best possible outcome+books
An Awesome Book+P+It is an awesome book. If you don't believe me and the other reviewers, go to the library and read it to see for yourself. It is definitely worth reading+books
No wonder his wife is friendly with the prisoners+N+This is the story of Sheriff Bell, an insufferable dullard who won't shut up about how criminals these days are really evil (as opposed to all the lovely ones he knew of when growing up?).   He's also a world-class boaster, never going more than a few pages without telling us how fantastic is wife Loretta is. The same Loretta who spends most of her time baking for or writing to evil criminals -- which tells me all I need to know about that marriage.  The yakkity-yakking doesn't stop there. An even bigger gas-bag is Chigurh, the motor-mouthed murderer. In fact, he kills people twice. Before he shoots 'em, he bores 'em to death. His weapon of choice: Lectures about coins. (His final kill took so long, I had to restrain myself from flingling the book across the train carriage.)  On the technical front, McCarthy does not structure the drama in the Classical way. He chose the Boring way. The majority of scenes end exactly as you expect and only one character (Moss) has a believable goal. McCarthy also omits the obligatory final scene, between Chigurh and his prey Moss, which was the only reason I kept reading the book. No doubt this is to defy the expectations of the reader. Expectations that this might turn out to be a decent story, in my case.   What's more, Sheriff Bell has no scenes with either Chigurh or Moss, making him a narrator with zero personal stake in the action. Because McCarthy writes good, visual dialogue, he gets away with an inconsequntial narrator for the first half of the story. But when the man on the run (Moss) exits the story, there is no other character to invest in, so the plot grinds to a halt. McCarthy cannot resusitate it because there is no connection whatever between the two remaining main players.  So, does McCarthy put us out of our misery? No. Sheriff Bell waffles on for pages and pages about Vietnam, not unlike John Goodman's character Walter in the Big Lebowski. And that's it.  My verdict: I hope Loretta runs away with a criminal. Preferably one of them new evil ones+books
Very Good Collection of Comfort Restaurant Food+P+`The Foster's Market Cookbook' by Sara Foster, with Sarah Belk King, I bought in my `buy everything I saw on the Food Network' phase, especially after I saw Sarah Foster demonstrate her killer sticky bun recipe on the Food Network's `In Martha's Kitchen' show. This was also in my sticky bun-baking period, before I gave it up as too much work and went back to straight breads.  One of the main reasons the book sat unopened on my shelves for so long was the fact that the `killer sticky bun' recipe was simply not that killer. Do not believe anyone when they say they have an easy sticky bun recipe, because it probably means the end result will fall below expectations. Around the same time, I did a sticky bun recipe from funny baker Wayne Harley Brachman, and that one didn't come up to snuff anyway. Leave it to Julia Child to come through for me. I did the sticky bun recipe in `Baking with Julia' and it was a LOT of work, but it in fact surpassed anything you can get from the mall.  But getting back to Sarah Foster's book, I have come back to it because I harbored s suspicion that there was some really good stuff in the book, and I was not disappointed.  Part of my attraction is that I am a sucker for any cookbook that covers sandwiches. While I think Foster's sandwich recipes are not as interesting or as complete as those in Nancy Silverton's whole book devoted to the subject, they are a great resource if you happen to have no other source of ideas for sandwiches.  Otherwise, the book covers everything you would expect, and it is especially strong on topics where you would expect expertise such as muffins, biscuits, scones, soups, salads, and egg dishes. On one of my favorite criteria for evaluating cookbooks, the recipe for a classic French omelet, Foster comes through like a champ. The only omelet tip she does not follow is to let the eggs come to room temperature before cracking and beating them, but then, this is probably quite impractical for a restaurant kitchen.  She is also quite good on another of my favorite criteria, the making of stocks. Her recipes are very good for non-foodies and people who care not for haute cuisine, as they do not take very long to produce a very acceptable chicken, vegetable, or beef stock. My only reservations may be that some of her suggestions may lead to waste perfectly good poached chicken on the one hand and include less than edible vegetable cuttings into stocks. There is a reason some people are hyperfussy about stock making. These are but two of the reasons.  I fully endorse Ms. Foster's recipes for muffins, biscuits, and scones. They are as good or better than recipes I have seen in books by professional bakers and books specializing in these subjects.  The hardest aspect of whether it is worth buying this book is how if will complement your current cookbook collection. If you are a cookbook collector, the question is moot. Nothing will stop you from getting this notable title. On the other hand, if all you have is `The Joy of Cooking', this would be a welcome supplement, as like fellow Martha Stewart alumnae, Ina Garten's early cookbooks, all the recipes come from a commercial kitchen which depends on their products for good business and the products are relatively easy to make.  This also means that the selection of recipes is very good fare for church bazaars and bake sales. While Foster is downsizing her recipes to household serving numbers, I am sure that her soups would work well at two to four to eight times her recipe size. Just be a little careful on multiplying some of the spicier ingredients.  I find all the recipes extremely well written. They are full of important details for amateur chefs and unlike some books, everything is printed in good old fashioned black and white with a little highlight shading here and there for sidebars. And, several dishes are presented in living color photographs, and little real estate is taken up by cutsie pics of Foster's Market staff and customers. My only argument with the layout of the book is the chapter title pages where the names of the recipes are written in a kind of multicolored hodgepodge, similar to the maddening typography in Jamie Oliver's otherwise excellent cookbooks.  Fostering this kind of material is what made Martha Stewart so respectable in what she did on her shows. Of this genre of cookbook, this is a very good sample. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for recipes from this `feel good market' venue. I think, for example, that it is more value for the money than Ina Garten's first cookbook.+books
Thin characterization+N+I agree with one the comments posted below. The main problem with this book is Mitch is a totally one-dimensional character and it's impossible to find any depth in him. Over the course of the book he doesn't change, he's unsympathetic, and by the time we've reached page 500, we don't know anything more about him than we did on page 10. I found myself dying to get to the end of this book, just so I could start another book with some substance and some well-drawn characters.  Another major problem is that most of the characters in this book use the same wise-cracking speaking style so there is no sense of the characters being different from each other in any way.  Overall, I thought this was mediocre and a bit of a waste of time+books
Stephen King is the best writter+P+I love all of his books they are great.This one I was a little sad but it has a great ending+books
Increase your Social IQ and Succeed in Business and Relationships!+P+At a time when people are more and more likely to communicate through text messaging and emails, instead of the deeper more nourishing and empowering exchange of a face-to-face, this book truly comes at the right time!   If you are in sales, or journalism, or you want to have a meaningful relationship, have a deep understanding of how to effectively lead a team by understanding what's happening past the overt representations of communication such as facial expression and vocabulary...  ...or just want to understand from a scientific observation what those little instincts and 'inner-senses' really mean and can do for you...  ...this book will take your understanding of the inner workings of social 'energy' to a new level.  Goleman takes the reader to deeper understanding of neuroscience and how humans are hardwired to respond in a number of varied (previously so mysterious), yet effective ways...if we just listen to what we're 'hearing/feeling'.  Humans are emotional and subconconscious sponges of life experience; and Goleman's 'Social Intelligence' great follow-up to his prior hit 'Emotional Intelligence' is the perfect material to beneficially get that deeper understanding and appreciation of your deep, neurological responses during person-to-person interactions+books
Extremely Disappointing+N+Although this book would appear to have a lot of promise, it ultimately fails. Like Mr. Taylor's self-proclaimed &quot;Certified Professional Landlord&quot; title (Fill in your name on page 218 for your own bogus certification!), these phony forms are imaginative but have little to no legal standing. Worse, Taylor apparently has little respect for his tenants. One form, the &quot;Tenant Late Rent Warning and Excuses&quot; form (&quot;To be given to new, renewing, and late tenants.&quot;) asks tenants to mark a box as to why their rent was late. Sample excuses: I was mugged. &quot;You didn't come by when I had the money,&quot; &quot;I didn't have a stamp,&quot; &quot;I'm dead.&quot; A chuckle for a landlord, but also a cynical and unprofessional suggestion. Taylor's advice on handling phone calls from prospective residents is even worse - he promotes using a hard-sell interrogation on the first contact that seems destined to drive away prospective tenants. Anyone with intentions to do good business would be well served to get more professional advice than this extremely disappointing book+books
shallow self-indulgence+N+I like to use the Amazon reviews when purchasing books, especially alert for dissenting perceptions about higly rated items, which usually disuades me from a selection.  So I offer this review that seriously questions the popularity of this work - I found it smug, self-serving and self-indulgent, written by a person with little or no empathy, especially for the people he castigates. For example, his portrayal of the family therapist seems implausible and reaches for effect and panders to the  "shrink" bashers of the world. This "play for effect" tone throughout the book was very distasteful to me+books
No improvement over the first one+N+Most first novels really are not that great but usually when an author produces a sequal there is a definate improvement but I found no such improvement when trying to read this one.  I figured I owed the author a second chance by reading his second novel.   What can I say, for all the hype, this book is typical of many published this day by members of the self styled 'Creative Class'. Politically Correct. As subtle as a Hammer. As narrow minded as the generation that the author condemns except far less productive and much less imaginative. Hardly any good.   Truth is I found it rather juvenile. In my my mind I found myself editing out the excess wordage. Perhaps half could be deleted without effecting the story. There really isn't much here.  Indeed It isn't a good story. No challenge to the reader at all. Blow away the baddies with modern super technology which to make it sporting the baddies are allowed to have some of.    It has all the defects of the first book compounded.   Toss it.+books
Left me empty+N+My kids started reading the Left Behind Kids books, and because I was concerned about the message and theology of the books, I started reading them also.  Then I decided to check out the "adult" books from the library.   I am a born-again, pentacostal believer in Jesus Christ, and parts of the theology are not what I read in the Bible.  OK.  I can stil enjoy a good book, one with interesting characters, realistic dialogue, and a good plot.  The issue of plot is difficult for the Left Behind books, I admit, because we know who wins if we've read the end of the New Testament.  As to the rest, it fell flat.  Most of the dialogue didn't ring true.  After a few of the books, I was interested in some of the characters, but by the end of the books, there were only a few of the original characters left, and they were some of the least interesting to begin with.  How many times do we have to read through the same sermons from the exact same scriptures in Revelation?  How many times do they have to tell us about the almost affair that someone had back in Book 1?  There is nothing new and interesting in this book. The last book is just boring.    It would have been nice, at the end of the book, to wrap up everything.   Jesus comes back, and everyone should be reunited at the end after the battle is over, right?  Some of the characters that were important early in the books are either barely mentioned or not mentioned at all.  It was an incredible let down.  I felt like I had invested in these books only to see what life would be like for everyone after the battles are over.  Nothing.  We stick with that one main guy, and everyone else is left in the dust.  It should have had a really, really happy ending, but even that was boring.  If I had my time back, I would stick to the kid versions, if only to discuss theological issues with my children.  At least in the kid books, the sermons are shorter.  And I will know not to get my hopes up for happy reunions at the end of the series+books
Smart Dogs, Dumb Authors+N+I couldn't even begin to count all the things Stanley Coren gets wrong in THE INTELLIGENCE OF DOGS.  For instance, in one section he claims that dogs have the ability to do math but in another part of the book he claims they can't tell the difference between a tug toy and human skin.  The first is clearly way beyond a dog's capacity, while the second is something which comes totally natural to them.  How did Coren get things so backwards?  And the "intelligence" tests he provides have nothing to do with intelligence but in how focused or driven a dog is to do the test (or game) while you're doing it.  For instance, I tried one of the tests with my dog by putting a piece of food under a towel, then waited to see how long it took him to find the treat.  I'd still be waiting if I hadn't decided he'd never look under that towel.  Then I tried the same game by teasing my dog with one of his favorite toys.  Then I hid it under the towel, and it took him less than a second to get that toy.  So my dog is apparently both on the smarter and dumber ends of Coren's intelligence spectrum.  (This is just one example, by the way: the whole idea of testing a dog's IQ like this is bogus.)  And don't get me started on Coren's pedantic retelling of the alpha myth.  Granted, he wrote this book before the latest research on wild wolf packs proved that there's no such thing as a dominance hierarchy, or an alpha wolf, or the rest of that alpha nonsense.  Though, I doubt if even that data would change Coren's mind.  After all, he seriously recommends rolling your dog over on its back every day and pulling one of the animal's hind legs in the air to create a posture which supposedly "signifies submission to the pack leader."  (Really?  Dogs use "signifiers" now?)  The funny thing is, shortly after reading that passage I saw a wolf documentary on TV and the papa wolf did the exact opposite or what Coren recommends!  He rolled over on HIS back and let the pups jump on top of him and bite his nose!  They loved it!  So I tried what the papa wolf did with his pups with my dog--an alpha male, if there ever was one--and HE loved it.  And later that night, on our last walk, he was ten times as obedient to me than he had been before I'd mimicked the papa wolf's behavior.  Again, Coren had everything exactly backwards to reality.   This "through the looking glass" quality persists throughout the book, with Coren even saying that dogs are capable of hypothetical, symbolic, and conceptual thinking.  Wha..?  I'm sorry.  I love dogs and I think they have wonderful abilities that should be honored and respected, but the abilities they DO have are geared for being a dog, not a mini-me with four legs and a tail.  For one thing, fully one third of a dog's brain is devoted to processing olfactory information, and none to processing symbols and concepts.  I think Coren needs to do a little more research on comparative neuroanatomy and actual wolf behavior before he makes more ridiculous claims like the ones he made in this inane book.+books
Charlie should have burned the manuscript!+N+I've read a lot of Stephen King's work, and loved most of it, but 'Firestarter' was a big letdown!  It's not quite in the 'abomination' category of 'From a Buick 8', but at least King could blame that one on his car accident. This one is probably only about as good as 'The Tommyknockers.' The premise is great, but once it gets away from 'Andy and Charlie on the run', and becomes 'The Life Story of Tom Rainbird', it goes downhill very quickly! Not to knock King too much, but as this books goes along, it seems obvious that SK was losing interest, either because he found the two lead characters too limiting for whatever reason, and wanted to 'explore' the supporting characters more; or simply because this book came out fairly early in King's career, when he was known to partake of certain 'substances' which he later swore off! Worth reading only if you really want to read every SK novel. Otherwise, just be glad that nearly every book he wrote after this one(with the exception of the two mentioned above) surpasses 'Firestarter'+books
Not as good as &quot;Women on Top&quot;+N+While the book was plentiful of wild, sensual fantasies, I was disappointed in some of them.  Many were hard to believe even for fantasies and many sounded like they were written by illiterates.  If you're looking  for this type of book, I strongly recommend &quot;Women on Top&quot;+books
1 cent book provides 3 cents worth of laughs...+N+The only problem is even though it's only a penny you'd still have to pay $2-$3 shipping. Not worth it! Funny book written by a sweaty little fat kid with crazy Christian conservative parents. Hearing a 14 year old virgin boy's opinion on abortion is great. And it's all yours for only one penny+books
Understanding the emotional basis of behavior+P+Patricia McConnell has written a wonderful book filled with engaging stories and much practical advice for dog owners. She incorporates the latest research findings on the workings of the dog's mind in presenting her own cases from her behavior counseling service.  Her discussion of counterconditioning covers an extremely valuable concept that is not stressed (or even utilized) enough by other behaviorists and trainers. This technique is invaluable and of nearly limitless potential in alleviating many emotional distresses and disorders in dogs.    Especially pleasing to see is that in her discussion of counterconditioning and other techniques the author diverges from the decades-old approach of addressing "behavior problems" (a term that should be killed off and unceremoniously buried - it's not the animal's problem any more than if your husband had a habit of talking too loudly to your liking would you tell your friends that he had a behavior problem) by focusing on simply eliminating the behavior. This mechanistic behaviorism approach may be effective in eliminating the behavior but frequently does nothing to relieve the dog's underlying emotional distress that is causing the behavior. For example, if a dog is suffering from loneliness because he is tied up alone in a backyard and barks endlessly for human attention and companionship there are plenty of ways to eliminate the barking. But there is only one correct one: alleviate the emotional pain of loneliness. McConnell understands this and focuses on this underlying emotional distress when working with the dogs to change unwanted behavior. In light of the advances in neuroscience, comparative psychology, and brain imaging, this places McConnell on the leading edge of the changes underway in how unwanted behavior in dogs should be addressed.  The primary focus in treating behavior "problems" is to help the dog rather than the owner. McConnell gets this. Most dog behaviorists and trainers don't.   I strongly recommend this book for all dog owners who want their dogs to get the best emotional care and support in all behavior-related matters.+books
Do yourself a favor and pass on this piece of garbage+N+I also bought the hype of NYTimes Best Seller.  Goes to show you some people have really bad taste.  The story was promising and could have been exciting without the awful dialog.  It seems like the author was being paid by the word - too much repetition, entire scenes which added nothing to the story, etc.  I would NEVER purchase another book by this author.  Glad it's over and this ones in the trash can...  Charli+books
Loved It!! However......+P+I would have liked the hero's character, Diaz, to be developed a little more. He was dark, mysterious, and sexy but even his face wasn't described very well. I couldn't form an image in my mind of what he looked like, like I could with Milla. The story, however, was awesome. I couldn't put it down and my heart ached for Milla. What a read. I would recommend it to anyone!!!+books
Another Fine Book by Brooks+P+The Go-Go Years is the history of Wall Street during the tumultuous 1960s, which saw the DJIA only briefly above 1000.  This book's players include H. Ross Perot (who, according to the author lost more than $650,000,000 when the market fell at the end of the decade), conglomateurs like Ling-Temco-Vogt's Jimmy Ling, Gulf Western's Charles Bluhdorn, and IT&T's Harold Geneen, and Peter Lynch's predecessors at Fidelity, Ned Johnston and Gerry Tsai.  One interesting fact:  in the latter part of the decade, the NASD closed early on Wednesdays to give the back offices of the brokerage firms time to settle trades+books
The only review material you need to pass IT Project +P+Dr. Schwalbe's commonsense approach to teaching you precisely what you need to know in order to pass CompTia's IT Project + exam should be commended.  She did a great job covering all exam topics as well as providing relevant practice test questions.  I had no problems at all passing this test and I owe it all to Dr. Schwalbe's, &quot;IT Project + CoursePrep ExamGuide.&quot;  I highly recommend this book if you're serious about passing CompTia's IT Project exam+books
Her "Nutrition" Advice Made Me Furious and Physically Sick+N+Alright, first of all, I have read dozens of books on nutrition and weight, etc., many of which were inspiring and very helpful. I highly doubt that many women in 2006 lack general nutrition knowledge, but if they do, it can be found easily online or in the library. Dr. Northrup's advice was ludicrous. 30 grams of carbs per day? I was encouraged when she began by citing Geneen Roth, but things deteriorated from there until I wanted to throw the book out the window. If anyone is looking for a mind-body approach to food, please, PLEASE do not read Dr. Northrup's chapter on "nutrition." Instead, I would recommend Fed Up by Dr. Wendy Oliver-Pyatt, Eating Mindfully by Dr. Susan Albers, any book by Geneen Roth, or even How Much Does Your Soul weigh, by Dr. Dorie McCubbrey. These books adress eating mindfully, allowing yourself to enjoy the foods you love while paying attention to your body's responses. Dr. Northrup's "nutrition" chapter is just another externally driven, trendy, but ultimately ineffective attempt to control weight and promote health (She calls herself a "sugar addict" and if you want information about that, read something like sugar busters (until you figure out that ALL diets will never work long-term). Anyway, I think she's a nut, and I wish that consumers were more perceptive and less desperate and likely to grasp at straws like Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom.+books
A critical analysis worthy of acclaim+P+Among the books in defense of globalization, this is among the best for the methodlogical care with which the author has presented his arguments. The text is lucid and very appropriate for students. Perhaps the only deficiency is a reluctance to engage the question of institutional reform with the WTO that could potentially compromise environmental and social protection. The failure of the Doha round and the WSSD in this regard is neglected. However, the author does an admirable job debunking a lot of myths that are so vitriolically presented by antiglobalization activists. +books
Great+P+Great book, definitely one of my favorite King novels. A lot more brutal and a lot better then the movie (which was great). The only thing I didn't like were the exerts from "Misery's Return", I hate romance novels even if they are written by Stephen King so I skipped over most of them. But the rest of the book was amazing and even though I'd seen the movie and pretty much knew what was going to happen it still had me in suspense and hooked through the whole thing, I didn't want to put it down and finished it in 2 days (which is fast for me). So if you've never read a King book before this would be a good place to start+books
Baseball's  Odd Couple+P+John McGraw and Christy Mathewson became two of baseball's most recognizable personalities with the arrival of the 20th century.   McGraw made his name initially as a third baseman with the scrappy Baltimore Orioles in the 1890's.  Mathewson was one of a very few college players, and found himself being tried as a first baseman along with pitching for the Giants when McGraw was brought to New York to lead the Giants for the next thirty years.  Author Frank Deford manages to weave together these two diverse personalities as each left their imprint on the game during their short lives.  McGraw died at the relatively young age of 60, although his bouts with the bottle made him appear much older than he was.  Matty died at the youthful age of 45 due to tuberculosis, probably the result of breathing poisonous gas during a drill among soldiers while in France during World War I.  The information provided on the old Baltimore Orioles can be found in numerous other books, most notably for me, Fred Lieb's history on the Baltimore Orioles as well as the information on Mathewson in other books.  However, I feel Frank Deford does a good job in tying together the lives of these two giants of the game who became great friends as well.  For all his crustiness, combativeness, and profane mouth, McGraw, who experienced tragedy as a young boy by seeing his mother and several siblings die of diptheria, had a sentimental side to him.  He hung three pictures in his office of his favorite players (Christy Mathewson, Ross Youngs, and Mel Ott).  The last sentence is not included in the book.  Following his playing career Mathewson became manager of the Cincinnati Reds.  He suspended one of his players, Hal Chase, because he believed him to be involved in fixing ball games.  When Matty returned from France McGraw offered him a job as a coach on the Giants, only to find Hal Chase now a member of the team.  McGraw had difficulty adjusting to the times as he bemoaned the modern (at that time) player, while the stature of his old Oriole teammates grew with the advancing years.  You can find a lot of the information on these two baseball legends in other individual biographies, but this book will bring these two giants and close friends together in one well done (if you will) dual biography+books
Mildly Entertaining, Completely Unrealistic+N+This book was readable and somewhat compelling in that I wanted to know what would happen next.  However, the narrative was ridiculous in its depiction of the character's lives.  A UCLA professor who seems to have all kinds of free time for attending events with her famous movie star husband?  It reinforces the stereotype of college professors having an easy job that doesn't require any more time than giving lectures (with apparently no preparation), going on sabbatical whenever they feel like it, and traveling to exotic places to do research.  That was just one of the silly descriptions in this very silly book.  I had to work to suspend my disbelief long enough to finish it.  It was like watching a soap opera - a guilty pleasure+books
Favorite book of all time+P+I realize that reviews are wholly based on interpretation and opinion and I respect that.  But I don't get people who don't like this book.  No offense.  That being said (or written, in this case), I loved this book.  I found it entertaining, odd and hugely funny and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone looking for a laugh.  My grandmother wouldn't get this humor, so if you're her, don't buy it.  Everyone else--go for it.+books
Amazing Gracie: A Dog's Tale by Dan Dye+P+Being an animal lover, a volunteer dog walker at our local shelter and a cat owner, I always read non-fiction books relating to animals and Amazing Gracie will be one of my favorites that I will remember.  The author's writing made it so I didn't want to put the book down, it made me laugh, cry, and educated about adopting an all natural diet for our pets.  It prompted me to purchase the other three books about "Three Dog Bakery" to learn more and as I already knew, people who love animals can make wonderful things happen in their lives as well as their pets.  Now we need a "Three Dog Bakery" in Milwaukee, Wisconsin+books
Wow+P+I love pop-up books and this one left me hungry for something sweet---Like a cookie. Wonderful pop-ups. Great premis. My Great Grand children loved this boo+books
Another wonderful resource+P+The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent is another wonderful resource on the Law of Attraction.  While it doesn't contain as many "new" insights as I had hoped, the material is (as always) thought provoking and energizing.  An easy read with outstanding examples of how to apply the principles of attraction in your life+books
Horrible Dissapointment+N+Let me get myself straigh here first. I have always been a fan of the Artemis Fowl series even though its started to fall into ruins. I loved the first one, and it was a wicked twist to the standard fairy tale stuff i ussually have to plow through, with the protangonist antoagonizing the fairies, instead of saving them from some kind of "evil" foe. Also the fairies were pretty cool, and had all of the problems of normal people such as sexism. They were high tech and armed with laser guns. Unfortunately the author put Artemis on the helping side of the fairies which took out some of the pizzaz.  Now let me rewiew this particular book. ITs a horrible read. who in their right mind would read something about a twelwe year old kid who investigates mysteries with no new innovative concepts? no me. now add the fact that this mystery is completely absurd, i mean seriously a "barbie" doll girl who gets kids expelled from school just because they're boys. How old is the author anyways? two years old? well obviously he's not married thats for sure. I always thought that these books were aimed at 13 and 14 year olds, not four year olds. Anyways enough of that, the author also proceeds to put in someothing about a talent show and other garbage abouta possesive father. I read Colfer because he writes futuristic books, that are predominetely fantasy not preschool level books about an obssesed teen ager who doesn't even solve robberies, instead he investigates some dumb boys vs girls war.  All of the wicked humor is lost, there is no action whatsoever, the main charecter isn't a genius with wicked humor, and the book reeks of drawn of bits from the others. Heavily downgraded, adn obviously the worst parts. DO NOT EVEN READ THIS THING. get some other artemis fowl books, or read Alex Rider,. thats a very good read.+books
Mean spirited+N+Woman-hating man writes novel about man-hating woman+books
The Biology of Belief?Unleashing The Power of Consciousness+N+I felt it was very scientific and difficult reading.  I wasn't able to get past 20 minutes with this book although I am sure by the title it has great information in it.  I don't feel it's for the average person more medical / scentific minds.   Truthfully, I feel my money was wasted and wish I would of took the time to return it.  +books
Massive and masterful!+P+With over 1000 recipes, this cookbook is going to take some time to truly put through it's paces, but I've had great results with the few dishes I've tried so far.  The Turkey Wraps with Chipotle Mayo rocked, with a gem of a condiment included - pickled red onion.  I'd use that on any sandwich, anytime.  The sauces for Halibut with Spicy Asian Vinaigrette (really a sambal vinaigrette) and Wasabi Cream were awesome.  Veggie dishes like Asparagus with Shallot and sesame seeds add a special touch to everyday dinners.    Granted, I haven't even put a dent in the vast amount of dishes represented in this massive cookbook - but so far so good!  I picked this up a few months agao as a remainder and paid about 10.00 for it - about a penny a recipe!  What a deal+books
save your money: poor translations/newsprint-like book+N+You don't need to trust me--you can look inside the book and get a load of the first translation of the "Frog King" which is unreadable.  Someone just took an old translation and reprinted it on poor quality paper.  This does not do justice to the tales+books
Disappointing+N+Like "Jurassic Park", this book starts out promisingly but runs out of steam within just a few chapters. My reasons for such an accusation: 1. Crichton overloads the reader with scientific facts. And while these can be quite interesting, they often obstruct the action and progress of the storyline (Dan Brown, for instance, is a writer who can properly balance compelling action with factual sensitivity). As a result, the book comes off as slow and stumbling. 2. The plot isn't all that interesting to begin with. (Vengeful gorillas? Talking gorillas? Misanthropic gorillas? Come on.) 3. The book's ending is utterly terrible. 4. Cricton's writing is weak, and the characters are inconsistent and unconvincing.  Sorry, Michael, but this book just didn't do it for me+books
Interesting history...+P+This was an interesting read.  Napolitano is a Fox News Contributor who is an advocate of interpreting via natural law and reading the Constitution literally for it's intended meaning.  As a result, the Fox News bashers will tend to ignore the book but it's worthy of their attention too because the leftwing liberal idea of reinterpeting the Constitution for today is what lead to legislation like the Patriot Act.  In an unbiased way (politically), his criticisms of the current administration are well-balanced with a good explanation and examples of abuse.  I've traditionally been a supporter of the Republicans and the Patriot act but the Judge's book have made me rethink the Patriot Act.  I was also surprised at how far back in time some of the interpretation contraversies go, some dating back to Hamilton and Jefferson themselves+books
OVERSTATED "HELP" BOOK+N+Although I am not a veterinarian, I have worked in an animal hospital for two years.  First of all, according to our medical practice, this book gives some bad nurishment advice!  Milk (and milk products such as cream and half & half) are NOT a good food for many cats.  Their systems are often not equipped to digest the enzymes found in cows' milk.  Having said what was foremost on my mind, I am also very disappointed in the "behavior" advice from this author.  I found very little information on kittens.....and almost nothing useful (which is why I purchased this book in the first place!).  In fact, I absolutely disagree with Ms. Wilbourn's suggestions about introducing a new kitten into an adult cat home.  From the new kitten arriving via "escort" to you (as the responsible owner) and leaving the new kitten to fend for itself all afternoon, as your adult cat "takes care of himself and his kitten".  What dangerous nonsense this is!  Stop and think.....what a 10 lb. adult could do to a 2 lb. kitten, if so inclined?  Perhaps the cats in Manhatten are far more anthropomorphisized (as opposed to Ms. Wilbourn's coined word "catsonality") then the felines with which the rest of us are familiar?  For the record, I currently have a terrific 15 year old, as well as a very feisty 4 month old.  I should have seen warning signs when this 224 page (LARGE print book) began with a 19 page forward.  No doubt this forward is intended to demonstrate Ms. Wilbourn's considerable knowledge.  Sorry, it doesn't.  Bottom line?  Save your money and try another author....preferably someone with the letters D.V.M after his or her name+books
Good Info/Confusing for Non-Military Types+P+This book provided a clear and tragic story of the invasion. You might want to take notes, however. Acronyms and abreviations should be explained more frequently, as well as military organization, for those of us civilian+books
Great Book....If your name is Chicken Little !!!!+N+To see my point read Edgar C. Whisenant's "Why The Rapture will be in 1988"  HA-HA-HA-HA!!!!!     Don't be taken in by Tim LaHaye's false prophecies asd broken promises.  This book has stated NOTHING that Christendom has not heard before. It's the same old "The sky is falling", superstitious, nonsense that has been rehashed since biblical times.  For example: 1John 2:18, 4:4 - John thinks he is living in "the last times." He "knows" this because he sees so many antichrists around.  1 Peter 1:5, 7, 20 Peter believed that he was living in the "last times. 1 Peter 4:7 "The end of all things is at hand." James 5:8 James thought that Jesus would return soon.     Readers, has there ever been a time in our world history that the so-called "End Time Signs" did NOT apply?  The Civil War, WWI, WWII, The Could War and all other wars and rumors of war wasn't good enough?  One of the signs of the "mark of the beast" started in 1948.  The Doomsayers were in a tizzy over the modern bar coding system then the Social Security Number system.  Recently, someone "set a bad precedent" by coming up with a novel way to find lost pets via an implanted chip (In the wayward animal of course)     It seems the statute of limitations has not ran out as to when the human race will meet its end and all the Chicken Littles has been making excuses ever since it all began.    2 Peter 3:4 "Where is the promise of his coming?" The author of 2 Peter is aware of the failed expectations of early believers. He knows that Jesus, who was to come soon, didn't come at all. Many have begun to ask, "Where is the promise of his coming?" He tries to cover for Jesus by claiming that "one day with the Lord is as a thousand years."  Mat:-16:28 Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.  Revelation - 3:11, 22:7, 12, 20 quotes Jesus (1900 years ago) as saying, "Behold, I come quickly.  Lahaye's book reads like tabloid trash. !!!!!     +books
Alex Rider Series jumps the shark . . .+N+Some of the other Alex Rider books may have been a little predictable, but Ark Angel is by far the worst book in the series.  As if someone with a cheesy tattoo of the world covering their head isn't bad enough, this book really "jumps the shark", not only does Anthony Horowitz yet AGAIN use the "corrupt rich guy" plot (this may have something to do with his childhood . . .), but at the end of the book Alex gets launched into space.  Save your $15 and buy Maximum Ride by James Patterson or a Scott Westerfeld book instead+books
She has done better work+N+This book is an enjoyable read if you have nothing better to do.  I failed to be captivated by it.  The characters lack the heartwrenching dramatic intensity that you find in her other works.  Maybe it is because Alice Walker is such a phenominal author that people just expect so much from her.  Still, this book is NOT making the cut for my personal library+books
Daring new way to teach C - successfully!+P+After having read this book I very much regret coming to C from a self-taught Pascal and C background - it could have been so much easier. Many introductory texts on C assume a background in one of the procedural languages and consequently start teaching the C subset of C first. This is, according to the authors' experience, counterproductive to understanding 'proper' C and programming true to it's paradigms and design. Thus they follow the radically new approach of discussing whatever (sometimes advanced) facilities C offers to solve a particular problem instead of going from one isolated language feature to the next. This leads to the somewhat unorthodox chapter sequence, which teaches the design of user types (classes) after introducing template functions (a feature many seasoned C programmers still don't know how to use effectively) or even stranger: the explanation of pointers and arrays (chapter 10) in terms of the standard library iterators and containers, which have been introduced as early as chapter 3. What I particularly liked are the useful and real world examples, although the book does cover the omni-present 'hello world' program, it otherwise fully delivers on it's promise of teaching 'practical programming by example' (subtitle). Due to this approach and the well constructed exercises at the end of each chapter the book gets the student writing non-trivial, useful programs taking full advantage of advanced C library features almost from day one. The authors also lead by example and show proper commenting and programming for flexibility techniques even in the smallest code fragments. This is in refreshing contrast to many an author's crime of showing the 'quick and easy' way first and the 'proper' way later. If you read The Design and Evolution of C you'll soon notice the repeated mentioning of Koenig and Moo as two of the key players in the development of the language. Their in-depth knowledge and experience really shows in this work. Although the book is mainly aimed at beginners, veteran C programmers can still profit from it, even if only by loosing some more bad old C habits+books
A book with to many numbers and figures+N+I bought this book to learn some interisting new facts that I have not heard about before. Well this book didn't do that. Most of the stuff in this book I have read in other places and it was written better. Like The "Red Queen" by Matt Ridley & "Why is Sex Fun" by Jarod Diamond.  This book relies to heavely on statistical data to come up with anything very interisting. I found myself skipping complete pages and chapters because of the boredom for having to read to many statistics. If you are looking to use this book as a resource to quote statistics about sex then you are in good shape, this book will give you plenty of that. Other wise i recomend that you stir clear of this book.+books
Not a good enough reference to be worth the money+N+This is a tremendously expensive reference that one should expect to be trustworthy. But it isn't. Nor is it as definitive as should be expected, though it does have some fascinating entries, such as the role of dogs in the history of food. For the price, there should be line drawings for some of the more unusual fruits and veg, because as it is, the verbal descriptions would lead a reader to think that something looked quite different than it does. So I use these two volumes with caution, referencing further anything said here before I take it as a given. Although some other reviewers here have criticized the dryness of style, that is what I want in this sort of thing, so I have no complaints there. Of far more importance is the slant that many of the articles have, which clearly have a political agenda that the information is wrapped around. So, while the bibliographies for same are useful, they also are selectively chosen. Given the guides to food now, and the many histories, I would think that a few books judiciously chosen are better value than this one reference, though if you are monied, this is an interesting addition to your library, to be read with a grain of salt in every 'Oh, my! I didn't know that.'+books
Who believes this?+N+This novel is absolute dreck, at the best. I don't think I could ever pick up another Grisham novel without vomiting. Pelican Brief was Okay. But, I honestly cannot read him again, because of this.    The reason for this one star rating is this.  First, the protaganist is a stupid punk kid, who by the end of the novel you are actually hoping gets shot or SOMETHING!  Second, 496 pages filled with "blah blah blah" There wasn't enough content to constitute a five hundred page novel. Maybe one hundred, and then it would have been decent.    Third, When reading about a murder mystery with the mob involved, you would at least expect more blood-shed, or more death. Especially since this is targeted at a group that enjoys those kinds of things.   Fourth, although written at a fourth grade level no fourth grader should be allowed within three hundred feet for all the swearing that takes place. Speech and the written word, are signs of intelligence, Vulgarity is something people use when they don't know how to convey something accurately. Honestly every page has at least some.   Now you know,that unless you want your socks bored off, you shouldn't even look in the section that has Grisham in it. If you want to read something light, that's believable, not Fantasy and not Romance, read Crichton.+books
I really liked this book+P+I liked this book alot, it was very different and it gave me alot of ideas of books to read based on what &quot;mood&quot; I am in.  It also gave me some insite to some of the books that I have already read, and how they perceived the books+books
Concise and Precise+P+Peter Drucker is a subject in and of itself.  His insights into the movement of people and their actions are legendary within the business world.  This book provides a clear, essential summary of his life work.  If  you are in business (which is most of us), if you are looking for ideas, or  just plain interested in who thought up some of the &quot;common&quot;  business maps of the day, chances are you can read this book and find out  that they are all linked to Mr. Drucker.  This is not your normal  biography- there is real substance here+books
Calvino could have written better stuff+N+This book says nothing. He brings you on a journey through nothing that will you unfilled. Don't read it+books

I Hate Stephen Hawking+N+Why? Because this book says nothing more than what he had already said in A Brief History of Time. However, I will say that unlike A Brief history of time, this one is a really, really big book with lots of colorful pictures so that they can charge an extra 30 dollars. And that he also changed the titles of the chapters. That's something...and the pictures were pretty!   Believe it or not after I read Universe in a Nutshell I decided to give good ol' Steve one more shot so I picked up A Theory of Everything. However, to my surprise, within those pages I didn't find a theory of everything...but I did find somehting that amazed me more than a theory of everything every could...Inside, I found A Brief History of Time! He had fooled me again!  It's a conspiracy, this man is publishing the same book over & over again with different titles to fool people into buying them. And he's including illustrations now because he discovered how well worthless pictures sell! Don't buy into it! It's a trick, underneath the new dustjacket, pretty pictures, and new chapter headings, these are same words!  I proclaim myself to be the first to say "I will not be fooled by Mr. Hawking again.+books
Another fine book by the master+P+Poirot is given a case by his old pal Spence which takes him to a small village, where the fussy detective must unravel clues behind a crime in which the main  suspect has already been arrested and sentenced... Hercule's indignities at the run down boarding house he's staying at make up the bulk of the story's humor, but the mystery is great fun, too and I doubt anyone can guess the killer, unless you're paying amazingly close attention. The characters here are some of Agatha's most entertaining, and Mrs Oliver, with her uncanny intuition,  always makes a nice flighty side kick..+books
very objective, indeed.+P+Intellectual, straight-forward, candid and objective-&quot;From Slavery to Freedom&quot; gives the actual picture of how African-Americans have been treated and where they stand in American History.

Riveting excursion into small town relationships.+P+Salem's Lot has become a yearly staple for me.  When the days begin to grow short, and the air gets a little thick and crisp, I like to pull this book out, and go for a lie in the hammock.  It has been a fall favorite, since my freshman year of college.  Though not entirely wholesome, this book is one of the most puritan of Stephen King's prolific library.  There are really no graphic sexual scenes, and the language is tame, in comparison to . . . say, The Stand.  But you don't care about that.  You want to know why I thought it was a heck of a good read. King is fascinated by small towns.  I can say that with a good deal of authority, because two-thirds of what he writes about takes place in small, Maine towns.  It's not the four-way intersections, and the cowpoke attitude that seems to capture his interest, but the dynamics of the small town, itself.  There is a certain attitude, in a small town; kind of like high school cliques, but on a grander scheme.  A small town has its own atmosphere; its own incestuous existence.  Stephen King enjoys watching as relationships frazzle, and small towns are demolished, with the ghoulish glee of a small child knocking over sandcastles.  'Salem's Lot mixes stark dread with a Rockwellian nostalgia that oozes out of the pages.  The result is a horrifically delicious milkshake that covers some traditional vampire ground, but also manages to stay fresh and poignant.  If the cemetery scene (in which a father grieves for his dead son) doesn't give you goosebumps, you are truly a jaded individual.+books
Excellent+P+This book was excellent and easy reading.  My 12 year old granddaughter, her mothe , my father and I read all of Dave Pelzer's series of 3 books.  We also read his brother's story+books
A very good book but you will need others+P+This is my 3rd book on real estate investing and I must say that each is totally different, with different ideas and different strategies.  I think it's important to keep this in mind because there is not one single book that can tell you everything you need to know.  I like how she talks about goal setting, something I've learned from Tony Robbins and that I feel is really important.  I like how she calculates the rate of return.  I like her differing point of views.  I would have never considered an adjustable rate mortgage before reading this book.  Overall I learned a lot, despite having already read 2 other good books.  A few things I didn't like:  I would have liked more information on selecting and comparing properties.  And especially calculating if I can afford it or not.  The information she gives is quite good, but since this is the most important topic I think it deserved even more.  The book is well worth the price and if you're serious about investing I highly recommend it.+books
Sexy Years for Who?+N+Some of this book is good and normally I love Suzanne Summers but.... A few comments like " no wonder men leave us for younger woman". Like what is that about? Woman need to feel better for themselves not some guy. Does she not know men also have hormonal problems and aging? When I ran into a few comments like that in the book it turned me off. Woman need to feel good about themselves and look good for themselves first. I just felt the book was a push for the S Principle Book and to be hot for your guy.  Usually her stuff is good but I wasn't crazy about this one. Sorry nothing new in this book. Maybe helpful to someone else. Jud+books
Good Grief+P+Like many reveiwers have already stated, this is a different type of King novel. There definitely is a slow unwind at the start for the first hundred and fifity pages or so, but I personally found much of it engaging. Beyond the main love story and Lisey's coping with grief over the loss of her writer husband, much of the book deals with Scott's damaged childhood, and the outlets the creative mind take to cope and fabricate in order to survive, but also in his case, to thrive. The climax for me was a slight disappointment, however the book overall was a reinvigorated and different world for King+books
A book about what overconfidence can do to a person.+N+I really do congratulate Bill Rancic for being HIRED by one of the richest man in the world. But being hired does not mean that Bill Rancic just became the next Bill Gates or Warren Buffet.

I'd rather retake my 'X100 intro to business administration' class in my college than to buy this book+books

Peter Smith hardcover WARNING!!!+N+If you're considering buying the Peter Smith "edition" of this book, note that it is NOT a new "edition" in hardcover but the Vintage International edition rebound in red cloth, with the cover of said trade paperback glued onto the front. It looks like it's been rebound for libraries, is the type of thing that's usually not for sale to the general public (. . .) The book is WELL-REBOUND, and may still be worth it to you Cormac McCarthy diehards out there -- it is for me, and ultimately I'm just gonna keep the copy of it I bought, but it's still quite disappointing. Thought you deserved a warning, hope it came in time. McCarthy's a great writer, of course -- feel a little guilty about the one-star, but it's an issue of the edition, not the book+books
How to behave and contribute in this KNOWLEDGE BASE WORLD.+P+This book is first published in 1999.  Right in the beginning, Drucker defined management as NOT only business management, but management in all kinds of organization: government, university, hospital, army, non-profit organization, etc.  The book is easy to read, just below 200 pages.  The scope and content is much wider than how we think management usually is.  It describes the CERTAINTIES: collapsing birthrate, shift in performance, global competitiveness, etc, and of course, how it affects all kinds of organizations.  It talks about information challenges, the knowledge worker and how one manage oneself in this new century.  Concepts like "individuals will outlive their organization", "how to defines one's goal and contribution" are all interesting topics and issues that everyone have to face, since, this is the REALITIES.  I highly recommend this book to anyone, not just CEO/executives, but those want to know more about oneself, how to behave and contribute in this KNOWLEDGE BASE WORLD+books
The garden of eden+P+I find Rousseau especially creative in the way he describes how inequality  progressed from the time the first humans made contact. He makes a good  case for the solitary life. I think Rousseau believes it is destructive  whenever humans come together in groups.  Governments were formed to  protect the weaker from the stronger or as Rousseau thinks to actually  protect the rich from the poor.  This is an outstanding book. It will haunt  you+books
Wow, how did this ever get published?+N+This is just a REALLY bad book.  First I blame James Patterson, but I really REALLY blame his editor.  What editor worth his salt would allow this mess to be published?    The villains are so grotesque as to be almost cartoon villains.  Just - over the top. The plot line is unbelievable.  Aside from Alex Cross and the two villains, nobody in this book gets more than a few pages before they disappear forever.  Alex Cross spends more time eating meals than using the resources of the FBI to foil the villains.  This is supposed to be one of those "the villains have given us a deadline before they blow up the world" type thriller but - there's no sense of urgency, and the law-enforcement agencies on the case are poorly sketched, and inept (but not deliberately written that way).  I could go on and on but it's not worth the words.  This book is REALLY a waste of time.  I can't believe anybody published it+books
Novel goes nowhere, can't believe this won something+N+Talk about a waste of time!  I was wondering if it was just me so I asked several friends who dutifully read this prize winner and they said they could barely get through it.  It is boring, tells you instead of shows you, hyperactively jumps around the timeline like a flea and provides no payoff at all.  I also found the protrayal of the grandmother's flirtation with Islam to be shallow, un-informed, unbelievable and ultimately dismissive. Don't waste your time on this or your money. Luckily I had picked it up at a book sale for $0.25, about what it was worth+books

Run, don't walk, to buy this book+P+HI.. I would say most people should run, not walk, to buy this book. It doesn't matter where you are starting from, everyone can benefit from this stuff, and there are a variety of ways to compile wealth that the authors talk about. I found it to be very inspiring and well worth the money. I would recommend it to all my friends, especially those who are befuddled by the markets, because it has simple straightforward advice. good luck to all the savers and investors among us! for socially conscious people, they also tell how to help society (as well as get wealthy.+books
Not The Best Choice+N+There is no doubt that Sun Tzu's little book on war is an enduring classic, but this little edition is ridiculous.  There is a reason it is so cheap.  It is all of 96 pages long, including the introduction.  If you are going to take the trouble to buy and read Sun Tzu's masterpiece, you should at least get a version that explains what Sun Tzu was really talking about.  The best translation is by Giles, as is this, but in the original Giles translation there is a running commentary, between the lines by Giles and several classical Chinese scholars, explaining both the context and meaning of the text.  It is virtually impossible to really appreciate what Sun Tzu was talking about without the background that the original Giles translation provides.  There are several editions of the full Giles edition available.  Any of them are a better choice than this little stripped down version.  The best is the Special Edition that contains two copies of the translation - one stripped down version, like this edition, in addition to the Chinese text and the fully annotated version that is twice as long as the unexplained translation.  Sometimes you really do get what you pay for+books
Murder, Romance, Wine who could ask for more !+P+`The Villa' was magnificent Nora Roberts's novel. The basis story is about a family of wine makers who find themselves fighting to save the family business after numerous murders, bad business, affairs and fire ~ all with a mix of romance. This book has some nice twists that you will enjoy. If you are looking for fun romance with a story I would also suggest Kate Angell `Crazy for you' and The Ice House by Minette Walters+books
Shocked.  Stunned.  Horrified.+N+I realize that Patterson is known for his exciting, page-turning reads.  I realize that he is famous for the relentless pace of his novels.  And, most importantly, I realize that he is famous for stunning twists at the endings of lots of his books.  Keeping all that in mind, I have to say that I was shocked and hurt by the, well, absolutely horrifying surprise ending to this book.  To say it came at me out of left field would be a massive understatement.  It's more like I was standing at home plate in Dodger stadium and was hit by a ball thrown from left field in Yankee Stadium.  Truthfully, I never saw it coming.  And I was horrified by it.  I finished the last pages with my mouth hanging open.  And I feel betrayed as well.  I realize that twist endings happen often, especially when it comes to Patterson, but I DID NOT LIKE this one.  I felt hurt by it.  Putting that aside, it was a good read overall, which is why I give it 2 stars instead of one+books
Edge Of Evil+N+This is J.A. Jance at her worst and the readers simpering narrations doesn't help+books
Not Lewis's best, but still a great book about Silicon Valley+P+Reading this book, you get the impression Michael Lewis just moved in with Jim Clark for a year.  Sadly, these direct interaction stories and anecdotes are not as compelling as the more standard journalistic backstory:  the tale of Clark's rise from abject poverty, the founding of Silicon Graphics and his eventual war with management and the board there, and the story of NetScape.  The up to date stuff is less interesting, unless you are really fascinated with big sailboats.  If we were rating Lewis books on a scale of 1-5, this would only rate a 3.  But since other authors have to also fit into the scale, this gets a 4..+books
Possibly the worst book I've ever read+N+Since I loved Jurassic Park and The Andromeda Strain (way back in high school) I happily picked up Congo at the airport. What an enormous disappointment - the book has the feel of having been written in an hour and a half. Nonsensical details are never explained (what's with the gray gorillas and the paddles? The gorillas were trained by the Zing-ites, back in the day, to execute people with the paddles and they sort of got into it? This is never made clear), the dramatic arc is entirely hosed up, and the characters are ridiculously one-dimensional. This is one of these books where you get to the last 30 pages and you realize that you're SOL - the plot is not going to come together, and you're not going to be satisfied. That, plus the obsessive detail about boring 1980 technology, left me entirely cold - this book hit the airport trash can the minute I debarked+books
Underworld+P+Underworld is an ambitious book.   By examining politics, economics, and popular culture in the United States during the last half of the twentieth century, author Don DeLillo engages in some interesting speculation about hidden meanings and connections that lie beneath our notice.  In the world that he depicts, people and events sometimes seem to be connected by some kind of field or ether through which unnamable forces operate.  In his opening scene, the lives of hundreds of thousands of people are joined by an historic baseball game, where a young man senses "the body heat of a great city ... small reveries and desperations, the unseen something that haunts the day."  In other passages of the book, these connections take the form of history or a system: "that thing you feel in an office ... sensing the linked grids lap around you."  The book focuses on Nick Shay, a man with some grit who escapes a meaningless life in the Bronx and becomes an executive in a waste disposal firm and a kind of savant.  It takes a long time and many people to produce this transformation, and this results in a pretty long book: 827 pages in the hard cover edition.  DeLillo is even more interested in conspiracy theories and secrets than in Nick's personal transformation, so along the way he shares a lot of arcane knowledge with the reader about the nuclear weapons industry, environmental degradation, and J. Edgar Hoover.    The connections between a few of the minor characters and subplots and the rest of the book are not obvious, and I would venture to say that a few of these could have been omitted without great harm.  Also, DeLillo's dialogue has a definite style:  his characters seem to hoard their words, and an awful lot of them don't finish their sentences.  Whether these are defects or not probably depends on the reader's tastes.  For me, this is a much better book than DeLillo's White Noise and Libra, which have been widely praised.+books
Satisfying read+P+A very romantic story. Somewhat graphic with quite of bit of swearing but in a low-key way. I read it and then read it again a few days later. Too long to read in one sitting. It made me cry+books
Don't waste your time+N+I very much looked forward to the ending of this book not to see what would happen but so that I could be done with it and move on to a different book! I found this book pointless. After reading 482 pages, I can't even think of two adjectives to describe Sally and Clare. Moody does such a poor job of character development that I don't feel like I know all that much about these two women. I did not like the main characters and I didn't feel as though they had much of a real friendship at all. The book is way too long, the plot is unbelievable, the characters are unlikable, and the writing style is annoying+books
Questioning what really drives the future...+P+I just had the pleasure of reading an advance copy of John Naisbitt's Mind Set!: Reset Your Thinking and See the Future.  There's a lot in this book that I'd like to recommend for those who think everything is "the next big thing"...  It's really not.  Contents:  Part 1 - Mindsets: Most Things Remain Constant; The Future Is Embedded In The Present; Focus On The Score Of The Game; Understand How Powerful It Is Not To Have To Be Right; See The Future As A Picture Puzzle; Don't Get So Far Ahead Of The Parade That They Don't Know You Are In It; Resistance To Change Falls For Benefits; Things That We Expect To Happen Always Happen More Slowly; You Don't Get Results By Solving Problems, But By Exploiting Opportunities; Don't Add Unless You Subtract; Consider The Ecology Of Technology Part 2 - Pictures Of The Future: Culture - A Visual Culture Is Taking Over The World; Economics - From Nation-State To Economic Domains; China - Will The Dragon Devour Us Or Will It Be The Dragon We Ride?; Europe - Metamorphosis To History Theme Park; Our Evolutionary Era - No Next Big Thing End Notes; Index  Naisbitt, the author of Megatrends, came up with a number of mindsets that can help someone understand where things are going in the future.  From that initial list, he pared down the items until he came up with what he felt are the most important eleven items that matter.  These mindsets, if understood, directly affect how you view current events and interpret your surroundings.  For instance, it's easy to look at each new technology and think that it will change everything.  But in reality, the same underlying forces continue to drive people's lives.  Business is in a constant state of flux, but it still ends up being all about buying and selling.  In sports, the one-handed jump shot in basketball completely changed the look of the game in 1936, but the game itself was still the same...  score a basket.  Once you strip away the fluff and hype, it's easier to understand where the general flow of life is going.  Or my favorite...  don't add something unless you subtract something.  Setting a cap on a situation (be it a sports roster or a number of menu items in a restaurant) forces you to weigh the merits of each item, keeping only the things that return value and dropping items that no longer measure up to the others.  Something to remember before you make yet another commitment...  Part 2 of the book applies a number of these mindsets to different current events and situations.  Personally, I found this part of the book a bit more unfocused than the first.  While I understand that the visual is becoming more important in today's society, I had a hard time staying focused on where the chapter was going.  He does tie the mindsets into the conclusions he draws, but I found the mindsets themselves to be more personally useful for my own life.  Definitely worth reading, even if you don't necessarily agree with him on how the mindsets play out.  I'll be revisiting the mindsets a number of times to get them firmly embedded in my brain.  And don't be surprised if I turn down some "adds" because I'm not ready to "subtract" something..+books
Whining Muckraker wants attention badly, misplaces causality+N+Anti-corporate Cassandras grind axes to sparse audiences these days.  In O'Boyle's piddling attempt to make us outraged at GE, he destroys his own credibility.  By attempting to pin every social ill of the late 20th  century on Jack Welch-- a good, if ruthless CEO-- his ideological ship  spins wildly out of control.  Downsizing is his fault. (Hello,  organizations are becoming streamlined all over the developed world)  Media  sensationalism is his fault. (Welch personally delights in the bottom  dwelling content of Dateline NBC) Anybody who has ever worked for a  corporation, especially one as big as GE, knows a few things that should  make readers way of O'Boyle's hokey cause and effect analysis: 1. The CEO  does not micromanage his or her company-- thousands of important decisions  are made under a CEOs jurisdiction every day. 2. Corporations are not  social utopias, and shouldn't be.  People get fired sometimes.  But people  are also given opportunities to do interesting work.  And competition is  good. 3. If there is a ubitiquitous problem in society, e.g. families are  no longer as stable, a corporation, which is sample unit of social  organization, will usually reflect, or possibly be linked more directly to  that problem.  However, small minds confuse this with causality, not  understanding the methodological pitfall of ad hoc ergo propter hoc.  For  example- families break up more, partially because people don't balance  work and family very well. Lots of people work for corporations.   Corporations caused the decline of the American family. Read the book--  O'Boyle is guilty of not understanding these truths and more+books

I left off a few chapters into it, there was no point in finishing. +books
A Waste of Money-- 5 pages of nothing ....+N+Save your money and just make a guide yourself.

Who to blame?+P+The major strength of this book is that it goes right to the heart of the debate on social welfare policy.   Who is to blame?  Is it the person or is it their circumstances? Normally hysterics on both extremes of the political spectrum try to place all the blame either on society or on the person.  This book makes a run at splitting the difference. Frankly, I found this book better informed than the famous Nickel and Dimed.  The truth is that poverty is a tough problem to solve, and many of the best minds on the left and the right have failed us+books
Good idea didn't translate into a book+N+I like the idea that Michael Lewis wrote this book/article to defend a man whose coaching techniques are clearly out of style in todays world of my child this and my child that. Having said that I did not like this book:  1) the writing was chopping and hard to follow at times. i had to re-read many sentences to understand lewis' point.   2) the story lacked the depth of lewis' other wonderful books - where's the who/why/what that lewis used to moneyball (and others) educational - i wanted the story behind the story.   3) who were all the pictures of? i found them distracting...   i'll continue to read lewis' books bu thope the next one is bette+books
sweetness!+P+I am loving this book, but let's get one thing straight.  This is not a cupcake book, as the cover would lead you to believe.  In fact, I only saw one reference to a cupcake from a regular layer cake recipe, even though it is written by one of the owners of New York's famed Magnolia Bakery, which has gained notoriety for its cupcakes.  At any rate, the recipes contained in this book are pure magic.  So far I have made the white layer cake with chocolate chips and peanut butter icing (as suggested), and it was quite a hit with friends and family.  Other recipes I'm going to try in the next few days are the sour cream coffee cake and the buttercup golden layer cake.  This book is all about making things from scratch like they did in the olden days, but you could also mix and match homemade cakes with store-bought icing or vice-versa.  Read the introductory section with tips and pay attention to the details (e.g., use cake flour instead of all-purpose or self-rising, use butter/sour cream at room temp., etc.), which will make all the difference.  The section with icing recipes is short but covers a variety of flavors.  It's definitely not an Atkins-friendly cookbook or any of that, so you know it's good for your sweet tooth!  I would definitely recommend this book to any baker, novice or expert, and am looking forward to buying 'The Magnolia Bakery Cookbook' (co-authored by Appel) next+books
A good, but biased, introduction to globalization.+N+In this work, Bhagwati offers valid arguments for globalization.  He is takes some of the strongest criticisms of globalization and is able to find fault in them, and at the same time, declares the benefits of a globalized economy. However, one need not read the entire book to find out Bhagwati's views.  Bhagwati's stance on globalization is almost so extreme that he instinctively and automatically comes to the defense of globalization without providing a fair analysis.  As a Harvard professor, I would assume him to provide more academic and holistic defenses and criticisms.  However, his book is an easy read and one that opens the reader to arguments for and against globalization whether s/he has previous knowledge of globalization or not+books
Excellent application of the MBTI to relationship dynamics+P+Despite its somewhat maudlin title and front cover, this book is very interesting. It based on Jungian MBTI theory which in my view is a very powerful tool for understanding people's personality. The book itself is not theoretical: it gives a brief description of the 16 types and then there is a couple of pages for each of the 136 possible combinations. Much has been printed about the MBTI, but this one has a very interesting practical approach. For each combination, you find a paragraph on the strengths, a paragraph on the weaknesses, and a short list of key recommendations for each partner. Even if you know everything about Jungian psychology you can still discover some new insights on personality relationships. For the anecdote, my INTJ recommendation list (with my ESFJ wife) is a pretty goood summary of everything I do wrong at home +books
totally suprising (in a good way)+P+this book was totally awesome! i mean people think that a sequel would just completly suck but no! it was great. i was very suprised how the author pulled me in with all the quirky romance, AGAIN! i can not express how great this book is. BUY IT! READ IT! anybody who loved the first one will abosolutly without a doubt love the second one+books
She Should Have Stayed Home!+N+I wish I had read these reviews before I bought the book.  I would have saved myself $26.00.  As an American who has traveled and now lives in Europe part of the year I was continually appalled at how she maligned other travelers. She writes of being invited to be a guest speaker on a cruise ship and insults in print all of the other passengers. She had a free trip while others paid, but she ridiculed everyone. I was totally horrified of the things that she said about her former Father-in-law. Those statements had no relevance to the book and they do not belong in public print. This man is the grandfather of her daughter.  I am astounded at how she thrashed him publicly. Her book consisted mainly of telling the reader what town she was in, what was wrong with it and the rest of the chapter boring us with what books she was reading and quoting other authors, and relaying in detail every morsel that her and her husband ate.  I have visited and even lived in several of the towns she wrote about. Of the ones I have not been to unfortunately, nothing she wrote made me want to visit them. I am an avid reader of travel books and essays.  I will never again read anything by Frances Mayes.     +books

Teach your children about &quot;ugliness&quot;+N+A to Z has a big problem in my opinion. It is a very simple children's book with some very cute illustrations of animals (A to Z).  Each animal is engaged in an action that also begins with the first letter of it's name  (e.g. Kangaroos Kissing).  There are lots of made up animals, I'm assuming  to account for the rarity of animals beginning with &quot;Q&quot; and  &quot;X&quot; etc.  The part that I don't like is the fictitious  &quot;Uglybirds&quot; whose action is simply &quot;Being Ugly&quot;.  The  illustration that goes along with this so-called ugliness is very  disturbing.  The &quot;Uglybirds&quot; have atypical bird features that  seem intentional.  They are green and purple, and have messed up feathers  and big bulging eyes and are very &quot;Different&quot; from the  &quot;normal&quot; birds in this and other books.  Upon reading this, my  wife and I agreed that we would never repeat this section while reading to  our daughter.  Although I do intend on teaching my daughter about ugliness  (Racism, Violence, contempt, etc.).  I think that it is a quality that  shouldn't be used to describe physical appearance.  When my daughter  encounters a person who is physically unusual, I hope that I have instilled  in her the values to disregard what others might find &quot;Ugly&quot;.  I  know that some might think that I'm overanalyzing such an innocent entry in  a child's book, I think that parents need to be more careful about the  messages that they are sending about ugliness+books
Myth under the guise of 'science'- A warning from a professional logician+N+If you want to read a Classic of Western Mythology, look no further.  This is specious philosophy under the guise of a supposed 'truth' about reality.  The tragedy of all this is noticing other reviewers' comments about how the contents of this book negatively influenced their lives.  Dawkins belief that we are machines created by our genes is a misleading view of reality, and when evolutionary 'science' catches up with evolutionary 'philosophy,' this view will come out false.  This could only be taken seriously by those who are so blinded by the details that they can no longer think straight, so they are not able to figure out where the argument is wrong, let alone realize something IS wrong with it.  What almost everyone doesn't seem to understand, even about VALID arguments is this: ALL a valid argument does is set up a tug of war between the premises being true and the conclusion being false.  If the conclusion is OUTRAGEOUS, you don't, "bite the bullet," "swallow the medicine," and accept the conclusion anyway.  You say there MUST be something wrong with the premises, even if you can't point out where the mistake is.  It took some 2,000 years before someone came up with a solution to why Zeno's argument that 'nothing moves' is incorrect.  But during that period of time, NO ONE (except maybe a few fools here and there- probably 'intellectuals' like this Dawkins character) accepted the conclusion that nothing moves+books
disappointed+N+This book was entertaining, but... there is only one 19-page chapter dedicated to the problem of "inappropriate elimination" (peeing/pooping in the wrong place), even though the author himself describes it as "the number one behavior problem".  He says "No other problem causes so much grief and leads them so often to consider the final solution of euthanasia".  I want to ask the author: given that, don't you think most people are buying the book for that reason and you should have dedicated more time to this topic???  The stories in that chapter did not contain any revelations for me - his examples all had fairly obvious causes and were easy to fix, such as the owner changed the litter box, boyfriend moved in, owner had 2 litter boxes for 6 cats, or the cat is doing it out of anxiety and responds nicely to medication (lucky them).  Throughout the book, I wish he had spent less time making cute anecdotes and more time detailing possible effective interventions+books
In the era of H5N1-brand Avian Flu, an especially chilling tale+P+In the era of Avian Flu, the First Horseman is a chilling tale. The reappearance of the 1918 Spanish Flu near a North Korean bioweapons facility causes alarms to go off in Washington. The hunt for a potential vaccine leads to an unlikely venue: an Arctic mining town where victims of the flu were buried in permafrost in 1918. These victims, provided they never thawed, would still have virus material in their lungs. These material could be harvested for use in a vaccine.  When American scientists finally reach the frozen town, they're startled to find an unsavory surprise awaits them. And things go downhill from there as an investigative journalist, the intelligence community, and other parties all race to get the vaccine before a biological attack is launched.  Yes, you've got predictable plot twists and the conventional, whoa-is-that-guy-psychotic criminal mastermind. And, true, you know how everything will turn out in the end. But in between, a fair amount of excellent research detail and some chilling analogs to today's world of H5N1-brand Avian Flu make Case's book both highly relevant and truly ominous+books
Concise and Precise+P+This concise introduction to critical thinking presents rules for clear thinking, valid communications, and creating and assessing persuasive arguments. Its 87 brief pages are readily accessible to high school students, and useful to anyone interested in offering correct evidence and valid reasons to support conclusions.  When so much of what we read, hear, and see is intended to persuade us, or even mislead us, it is important to distinguish valid arguments from careless or manipulative ones.  If good writing is clear thinking made visible, then this book provides excellent advice for writers. As a rulebook, it begins by presenting 30 rules for clearly constructing a valid case supporting your conclusion. It then turns to applying these rules for writing argumentative essays. It also treats fallacies and includes an appendix on correct use of definitions. The author recognizes this book is only an introduction to these topics and provides a good list of further reading.  Fallacies are seductive and often go unnoticed and unchallenged. In this book, many fallacies are described alongside the rules they violate. A short chapter then names and briefly describes many types of fallacies. I would have liked to see this expanded. We have long recognized sexist and racist language and work to purge it from use. I look forward to a time when a broader set of fallacies will be routinely recognized and corrected in everyday conversation. Perhaps then it will be common to interrupt the speaker to say something like: "Excuse me, but you just used the fallacy of modus ponens by affirming the consequent. Please correct that logic error before proceeding."+books
Delightful+P+Wintry, restful, appropriate, delightful illustrations accompany one of my favorite Robert Frost poems.  My children will enjoy this poem as much as I do+books
CHARLES DICKENS IS EXTREMELY OVERATED!+N+I love to read great books like BRAVE NEW WORLD by Aldous Huxley or FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD by Thomas Hardy. I love THE AENEID by Virgil, THE ODYSSEY by Homer. I read both long versions of LES MISERABLES and THE HUNCHBACK OF NORTE DAME by Victor Hugo. I read THE RISE AND FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE by Gibbons and gained much knowledge from doing so. I LOVE TO READ.  But GREAT EXPECTATIONS was a GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT! I was somewhat amused until chapter ten where I felt the book became psycho-babble. I was also disappointed in TALE OF TWO CITIES. I could not endure the first two chapters! Dickens did a fine job on THE CHRISTMAS CAROL. But I will NEVER read another of his books+books
Really lousy attempt at depth and humor+N+This is the kind of garbage they teach you to write in college--imitations of what's on the shelf right now, only "smarter," which really just means "condescending to those not born with a silver spoon in ultrawhite Marin County." But you shouldn't be surprised--the authoress also writes a blog which is just as bloated with self-absorption (even if she wants to pretend this is a novel: novels have PLOTS, honey). Bypass this and read some Dorothy Parker instea+books
Overly simplistic..+N+Barber's analysis ignores important facts in order to prove his thesis about how the primary battle in the world being between the free market and religious fundamentalism. It works, somewhat, but fails to take into account numerous instances where this tension is called into question. Not every zealot in the world is an enemy of technology, as the War in Iraq has shown us.+books
A good book, except for the writing+N+Jim Ainsworth clearly demonstrates his extensive financial consulting experience throughout this book.  Much of the information is valuable, and it covers the important beginners' range of knowledge effectively. However,  his 'down to earth' style is not only irritating, it actually makes the  book painful to read. Good written English is not always the same as good  spoken English. Surely the man is a succesful financial consultant, but  that doesn't make him a good writer. It just goes to show that in a hot,  growing industry like financial consulting a book written by a 'qualified'  author will sell even if it is poorly written+books

Excellent resource for understanding a complicated issue.+P+Dr. Rydelnik has done an excellent job of synthesizing his study of history and the Bible to bring clarity to an often-unclear issue. This book gives the reader a good grasp on the history, development, and current state of the the land of Israel and the conflict with the Palestinians. It also provides us with an invaluable, clear presentation of what the Bible has to say on the issues of who can claim ownership of the land, and of Israel and the Arab states in prophecy. I highly recommend it to anyone who would like a better understanding of the Middle East conflict, beyond what the headlines tell you.+books
A Satirical Masterpiece+P+Satirical.  Sarcastic.  Ironic.  Humorous.  Salinger is the master at the concept of deriding and satirizing the elements of life.  This book reveals the emotional roller coaster of a teenage boy's life.  The story starts off with a moody teenager, Holden Caulfield.  He is expelled from his third school, Pencey, and decides to hang around in New York City before heading back home.  In New York, Holden experiences the highs and lows of his life.  One minute, he is in a very elated state and then the next minute, he is down in the dumps.  As Holden journeys through the nice neighborhoods to the slums in NYC, he realizes what the true world holds in store for him.  Holden encounters run down hotels, clubs filled with losers, and plain old phoniness.  But he also meets kind and generous people who, in a way, provide a light to Holden and shows him that the world isn't all that bad.  Holden continually criticizes the phony life led by all those he knew through school and friends.  When he tries to run away from it all, he encounters even more problems with money shortage, unfriendly people, and just plain bad luck which lead him to complain about everything.  Salinger masters the art of satire to emphasize his message that being phony causes the person to lose their true identity and makes them assume another identity which they cannot live with at all.  As Holden tries to rediscover himself and his values, he finds out that his life is not bad at all compared to the bunch of phonies he meets+books
How did this book win an award?+N+I am a fan of Michael Crichton's.  Having said that, I felt that the writing style of this particular book was incredibly choppy, and that certain characters were not well developed at all (e.g. the wife!)    The basic premise was very interesting and the book was suspenseful; it moved along at a fast pace.  However, Crichton added too many characters, and made the book too dense.  I had to skim the last several chapters because I wanted to know what happened at the end, but I was getting extremely bored.  Obviously, he has come a long way since this book :-) Sigrid+books
Bad Journalism+N+One of the more interesting topics in this book is the Arab-Israeli conflict.  While there is much more in the book than this portion, I think Huband's treatment of this conflict is so far off that it compromises the entire work.  And Huband begins the section by quoting an Arab who says that although Israelis say they want peace, they do not really want it.  Well, what are we to make of this?  After all, we know that the Israelis, good or bad, do want peace and do need peace.  They spent the past several decades building up a nation.  And they want to keep it.  That is one reason they need peace.  And that is also a reason why it is easy to tempt them with bogus offers of peace, just like tempting a fish with bait on a hook.  But just as fish need food, Israelis need peace.  Huband didn't say that.    But we know that Israelis really do want peace.  We know that if Israelis are innocent victims, they want peace.  We know that if Israelis are guilty thieves, they still want peace, just to keep their illicit gains.  What does it mean for Huband to imply that Israelis do not really want (or do not really appear to want) peace?    Well such a claim is surely a falsehood.  But more than that, it is a taunt.  After all, suppose a bully decides to beat you up.  And suppose that bully claims you want to fight!  Obviously, you may well prefer to be left alone to being beaten up.  What the bully is saying is a taunt.  It's more than a mere falsehood.  It is a blatant way for bullies to tease their victims.    That means that Huband's book is taunting Israelis.  That's not a very good thing for a journalist to do.  It goes beyond telling mere falsehoods.  Huband also implies that Jews have taken Arab land, and admit to it.  And that they have taken an Arab country!  I wonder which one?  And I also wonder if buying land at high prices constitutes "taking" it.   After all, we humans are living on the same planet as the one that existed in 1805.  Not one human who was alive in 1805 is alive today.  Have we all stolen the planet from them?  Of course not.  We have bought it and inherited it.  There has been some theft, but that is no reason to invalidate the right of all humans to live on this planet today.  Huband implies that the Arabs ought to have a greater right to steal Jewish land than the Jews do to own the land they bought at high prices.  That's bad journalism too.  And there's more.  The author calls former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu an "extremist."  Now, I might understand making some snide remark about former Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who after all was a former leader of the Stern Gang.  One might even do the same for former Prime Minister Menachim Begin, who was a former leader of the Irgun.  But Netanyahu?  Once again, this is poor journalism.  And by the way, you might want to see how often the author calls any Arabs "extremists."  It is true that antisemitic propaganda and incitement in the Arab world has reminded many Israelis of similar propaganda and incitement in Germany in the 1930s.  And that has resulted in some analogies being made between Arab antisemitism today and German antisemitism before and during World War Two.  Huband makes fun of such analogies.  I think he should have taken them seriously.  More bad journalism.  The author does take Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi seriously, though.  Huband quotes him to explain that the Arabs are "innocent bystanders," and that the Jews are visiting revenge on the Arabs for European antisemitism!  This is total nonsense, of course.  More bad journalism.    Now, does a "one-state" solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict make sense?  Maybe so.  Israel exists in order to protect Jewish rights and to provide a refuge for Jews.  It exists to provide a state where Jews will speak Hebrew natively, attend Hebrew schools universities, have Hebrew traditions, and so forth.  It can do all that in a state which has a large non-Jewish population.  And Israel, even with ten thousand square miles, would be rather small for a state which houses over five million Jews.  If Jewish rights to life, liberty, property, and immigration are protected, a one-state solution may be best.  Besides, while many people say that another Arab state is needed as well, I see no real need for one except as a mechanism to attack or destroy Israel.  The author agrees that a one-state solution is best.  And I think he even acknowledges that Israel is part of the Middle East.  But it seems to me that his reason for wanting a one-state solution is to demolish Jewish rights rather than support them.  And getting rid of human rights would be bad for everyone in the region.  This book is a good one to avoid+books
Cynosure Scallions on the Mountain Look Downwards (Upon?) the Zebus & Sevens+N+Really tried to like this book. Premise was grand; story bobbed and weaved; conclusion was flimsy.

Threw it Away+N+The good first. There is a lot of good. I enjoyed and agree with every chapter except the chapter about men keeping a visual rolodex of sexual images for their perusal.   My husband and I have a great marriage. He knows I have the utmost respect for him and he has great love for me. He is certainly not ever wanting more sex, just complaining about how he feel like a piece of meat sometimes. (In jest I'm sure.)I say that to show, that not coming from a prude, the author puts for the idea that men just lust and fantasize about women nonstop and it's normal. I am quite sure she used the word normal at least twice. It was dealt with like, it's a fact so get used to it.  Your man might chase women around home depot to get a better look, or go out to dinner with you and remain preoccupied with the hostess all night. The men give accounts of this, like, oh well, doesn't mean I don't love my wife.  In my opinion, just b/c they aren't willing to risk actually acting on those thoughts, doesn't mean it's ok.   I found the book to be very very discouraging. That a bunch of married Christian men would unapologetically (key word here)see a woman in a fitted worksuit no less (we're not talking lingerie here) and think about what she's like in bed or what her nipples look like. There's no mention that maybe this is lust or committing adultery in your heart. Or maybe they should not do this. It really threw me for a loop! I guess I didn't realize just how insecure or sex crazed men are. Not that I think they don't want a lot of it. But I found it discouraging for Christian wives to think that their husbands can't go to work without picturing everyone naked.  I found it disturbing that the book is purporting this is giving the idea to men a lisence to do this since it's "normal" and women just need to get used to the idea+books

700 pages of reader suffering+N+This novel started out pretty good in that I didn't know where Koontz was going with Martie's panic attacks and fear of herself.

If this had been my first Koontz novel, I probably wouldn't bother with a second.+books
I have a dream too+N+That one day 4 year olds will be able to actually read this book. This book is not meant for kids aged 4-8. It is well beyond what they understand. Frankly , i don't even think a 4 year old can even read this. Nice pictures. But unfortunately , i don't enjoy buying a book for pictures. I can get pictures anywhere. I didn't need to purchase this book to get them. Anyway , don't buy this book unless you enjoy paying a high price for pictures. With regards to the age group. Unless you have a gifted 4 year old this book is a waste of time for him/her+books
Poorly Written and Inaccurate+N+A disappointing rehash of early works on the 1781 Siege of Yorktown.  Half the book deals with the southern campaign of the American Revolution.  The portion of the book dealing with Yorktown strays greatly from the chronological happenings of the siege.  For example, the author starts detailing the story of the assaults on redoubts 9 and 10, which occurred on the night of October 14th.  Before completing the account of the assaults, he jumps to the sortie by the British on the night of October 16th and then after several paragraphs goes back to the assaul on the redoubts.  A better choice for those wanting to read about the siege is Henry P. Johnston's book on the Yorktown Campaign+books
Phillips CAPM is obsolete+N+Do not buy this book unless you are being retested on the old PMP or CAPM exam.   This book is based on the 2nd edition (2000) of the PMBOK and is therefore obsolete.  The current exams use the 3rd edition (2004) of the PMBOK.  Much has changed so this book will mislead you and you will answer exams questions incorrectly.  The processes, process groups, some definition have changed.  As a result, many of his test questions will be wrong also. I am a PMP and I teach PMP and CAPM test prep sessions+books
Ivory tower crackpot theories.+N+No intellectual can afford to be unacquainted with the immortal John Dewey and his "experimental school." Who would dare criticize the education legend inseparably linked with the irreproachable rhetoric of "progressivism?" I would.  Dewey's conception of the child as learner assumes that the uneducated mind is essentially capable of directing its own knowledge by a spontaneous inquisitiveness stemming  from nature study. This he then expects to blossom into a more expanded consideration of the various academic subjects with the teacher merely facilitating transitions and answering the child's self-posed questions. The problems in Dewey's model begin with his science fair-meets-museum-meets-playground-meets-lecture hall school design: the model is untested on any large scale and the cost plus upkeep is prohibitively expensive. Classes are small and require several specialists and non-reusable materials. As if kids didn't have enough problems with the basic skills set already, Dewey would have them heavily involved in shop and home economics. Even more outrageous in Dewey's model is the premise that we ought never force students to study what they do not like. Their own intellectual prejudices reign supreme and by implication, teachers are discouraged from evaluating against solid standards. Experienced teachers know that kids can easily hide their shortcomings even when required to study their weak subjects, and that remediation is hard to implement before they slip further behind. How could Dewey's recommendation to cater almost exclusively to the child's intrinsic likes NOT further disguise and exacerbate low performance?  Deweyism of course, like many other off-the-wall theories of education, denies Behaviorism when it refuses to acknowledge psychological patterns in man. It depicts formulaic teaching and learning as fundamentally faulty and generalized curricula as harmful to student individuality. Nothing could less representative of the quality research conducted, particularly Project Follow Through: the great skeleton in the student-centered advocates' closet. I'd personally like to see Dewey's updated plan for seamlessly moving kids, who come into class with their "natural inquisitiveness" programmed by TV, rap music, and other pop media, into colonial American history, calculations of hyperbolic asymptotes, Tennessee Williams, and the "plus-que-parfait" tense. But of course, such leaps of interest are unnecessary if we utterly throw out the old-fashioned academic corpus along with the old-fashioned school system.  90% of students in high schools today report that they do NOT feel adequately challenged. Maybe the answer doesn't lie in yielding to children's lack of intellectual discipline but in tapping their potential to control that uninformed caprice. Dewey's "progressivism" relies upon the contradiction of allowing uneducated mind educate the teacher on its own education. From the absurdity of it, I can only conclude that sane people latch onto this school gedankenexperiment to maintain an escapist fantasy in light of dismally high drop-out rates, lowered standards, and social discord. But a radical solution is not necessarily synonymous with a good one+books

a 'coming of age beautifully' account+P+I received this book at my 60th birthday party (which was a weekend with women only -30 of us - at a cottage in the Canadian mountains). Everyone autographed it and wrote something to me in it just like in the 50's with your highschool yearbooks. Each woman picked out a page and just wrote what she felt or thought. I also shared it with my friends who couldn't come to the party and they also signed it happily and sincerely. There are many autographs and lines written throughout the book and I still look through the pages with enjoyment. Women of all walks of life, all circumstances, all levels of inner and outer beauty featured within its pages - just like my friends.   Since then, I have bought it for most of my girlfriends at their coming of age parties.  It's a good time to be 60, I will tell you that+books
Knew it was bad after three pages+N+I'm sorry, but I expect more out of a book. Beginning on page one the character development was infantile and the writing sophomoric.

So I get to feed my desire for great fiction, and get my work done at the same time.    Blair Brown did an incredible job as a narrator. She was able to create a unique "voice" for each character in the story,making  it easy for the reader to keep track of all of the characters from the get go.  However, by the time I got to the end of the tape, I was glad that I at least had painted those six hours instead of wasting my time reading this novel!  I was so disappointed at the end, and found myself really irritated by the main character about three quarters of the way into the story. From the beginning of the story, I was irritated by the character's daughters too.  Also, I was irritated that nothing outwardly seemed to change in Rebecca's life.  OK, she had an arc, but it was all in her head. I found it very unfullfilling.  If I hadn't been passively listening to the story, while doing something else, I probably wouldn't have finished the novel+books
Wow+P+Why is it so hard for us to give this man the credit he deserves? We've seen the movies and read the books. And yet, every time I see a book by John Grisham in Hangzhou, I think, "I don't have to finish reading it if I don't like it." I think of his value as trade bait, since he's so popular. And yet, I have never put aside a John Grisham book unread. What more does he have to do? Become less popular?   The premise on the back cover is simple enough. A homeless guy takes nine lawyers hostage, somebody dies, and one of our lawyers is changed by the experience. You have no idea what an excellent novel can come from such a simple idea. I've read almost everything Grisham has written, and I can remember most of it, and I'd have to put this at the top of the list. He's a master of character, plotting, simplifying the complex, setting, words, and accessibility. The writer should do all the work so the reader doesn't have to.   John Grisham, folks. He's the genuine article. Let's say it, okay?+books
Some textbook!+N+This is the longest textbook I have in my collection and it is also a bad investment book at that. I know some readers really enjoyed the detailed explanations, but the book was too detailed and wordy for me. Many of the explanations are unnecessary and examples can be simplified to get to the core of the problem/concept and drive at a much stronger intuitive understanding. But this book doesn't do that. It is cluttered with definitions and wordiness that kill the intuition one could get by reading a more concise, straightforward text. A really good book is Investment Science, by David Luenberger. Although his text assumes you have some background in calc/stat/probability theory, the writing, examples, and organization is far superior. You'll actually begin to understand how investment really works, without getting bogged down by the numbers, terminology, and jargon+books
Not worth it+N+This was the first book by Daniel Steel that I laid my hands on....Really could not make out how she strikes the chord with the readers. There are so many open ends in the story...chartacters are not distinctly outlined...Tremendous scope of improvement on the story is there+books
Connie in NC+N+I agree with the comment below.  Boring.  I also have read all the books in the series and look forward to each new one.   This one was not up to the standard I expected with the In Death Series. By the end of the first chapter you knew the killer and why.  The conflict with Mira didn't fit either. Maybe the next one will be better+books
Disappointing+N+This book has a lot of names.  I'll give it that.  But, there are some relatively common names that are missing.  And so many invented names.  My favorite of the invented names are Schmoopie and Poogie.  As if these names will show up on a birth certificate!!   The definitions/origins of the names are poorly researched and confusing.   For the name "Cowboy" the book tells you it means "country"  for the name "Country" it tells you it means "western".   Not that either of those is a standard name, but, for "words as names" aren't you going to pick it because it has meaning to you?   Also, the lists are totally false, something the author (if you can call her that) made up while sitting around drinking with her buddies.  And some of the names on these lists aren't even found later in the book.  (ex. Lynus on the "Party animals" list) I wish I had held out for a trip to the bookstore instead of just picking up the first book I saw at Walmart.   I figured with so many names I would find one I liked, but I am just so distracted by all the junk that I will never find a good name here. +books
Charlie should have burned the manuscript!+N+I've read a lot of Stephen King's work, and loved most of it, but 'Firestarter' was a big letdown!  It's not quite in the 'abomination' category of 'From a Buick 8', but at least King could blame that one on his car accident. This one is probably only about as good as 'The Tommyknockers.' The premise is great, but once it gets away from 'Andy and Charlie on the run', and becomes 'The Life Story of Tom Rainbird', it goes downhill very quickly! Not to knock King too much, but as this books goes along, it seems obvious that SK was losing interest, either because he found the two lead characters too limiting for whatever reason, and wanted to 'explore' the supporting characters more; or simply because this book came out fairly early in King's career, when he was known to partake of certain 'substances' which he later swore off! Worth reading only if you really want to read every SK novel. Otherwise, just be glad that nearly every book he wrote after this one(with the exception of the two mentioned above) surpasses 'Firestarter'+books
Betrayal of Trust+N+I received what looked like a nicely preserved used copy.  The book literally fell apart from the binding the first time I read it. It continued to come unglued from the binding each time I attempted to read it.  Not a good quality copy.  Would not purchase from this supplier agai+books
Got bored quickly+N+My roommate gave me this book and I thought it would be a good read during the winter break (I am a college student).  Halfway through chapter 2 (pg 18) I decided to stop reading the book. The book can be summarized by saying that we human make decisions based on feeling and not logic. This book explains why is that. But it doesn't teach you how to become more logical+books
Two cold cold worlds +P+This is one of my least favorite Bellow novels. But because it is Bellow it has a lot worth reading in it. His thoughts about society and culture may not always be exactly on the mark, but they usually stimulate and inspire. In this novel the hero is a bit less sympathetic than many of his other main characters. Henderson, Herzog, Humboldt, Sammler , Augie March have vivacity and life that Dean Corde does not.  The Dean's wife too falls short of Bellow's livelier and more appealing feminine creations, for instance the Ramona and Madelaine of Herzog. So too the whole spirit of the work has about it a pessimism and bleakness which contrast strongly with that of Augie March, and Henderson, and even in its way, Herzog. This book is really a winter book, and it has coldness and dying in it. And it has the oppression of the Communist Iron Curtain world in Romania, and the depression of Chicago's most beaten and desperate streets. The characters and the story seem less alive than the ideas.  Again this is not one of his best. Far from it. But it is Bellow and because of that a worthwhile read.+books

Thrilling+P+"The Andromeda Strain" may be an antique in science fiction, having been published in 1969, but that hardly diminishes its excellence.  The caliber of Michael Crichton's research is such that I still found the technology and science in the book impressive (though the computers were obviously dated) despite the book's age.  The plotline is thrilling, and though some of the scientific and philosophic asides are lengthy, most are equally fascinating.  I was slightly disappointed by the ending; however, the rest of the book was amazing and made the reading worth it+books
Still worth reading+P+17 years later and many things have changed. The desire of investors to accurately gauge the stability of the companies in their portfolios remains the same. The incentive of management with stock options to hide the true nature of what the reality of what the company's earnings have been remains strong. Some of the techniques mentioned will be hard to use when companies employ SPEs to hide their true indebtedness and derivative positions mask the Value at Risk. However, many of the technique still have value. The analysis of receivables and inventories can provide insight into the immediate future of the company. The techniques that have lost their clear edge are the debt and write-off analysis. Write-offs are now required by GAAP (although the "big bath" write-offs are still "non-recurring") and SPEs or variable interest entities can obscure debt. It is fascinating in light of Enron, WorldCom, Qwest, Tyco, and Adelphia the stories of companies in the 70s and 80s that were attempting to do the same thing (though often without the fraud).

Great Read for those interested in travel, foreign affairs+P+I finished Kaplan's Ends of the Earth today.  I liked the book.  Kaplan has consistently been one of my favorite authors (Atlantic Monthly) His theme is consistent: many nation states are not really nation states.  I felt that his comments about Iran were especially poignant, given how some view Iran as part of the "Axis of Evil".  I get the sense that when this book was written, Kaplan had great hope for the future  of Iran as they struggle with theocracy.  Ecocide, or the killing of natural resources is a new topic for me that Kaplan introduces.  According to Kaplan, many developing nations have traded immediate benefits for the long term health of their natural resources.  His observations are very very interesting, especially his observations from the  post-Soviet nations like Uzbekistan.  Kaplan is a bold, imaginative and thoughtful writer, he is not merely another journalist or another travel writer. His message, right or wrong, is sincere and based on his own personal observations. I highly recommend this work for anyone interested on new perspectives in current affairs. +books
Amazing little booklet+P+When I first saw it I got disapointed for the size of the book.  I realized how good it was when I started reading it.  It's amazing how much information was placed into such a little thing+books
This book has a special place in my heart+N+This is one of those rare treats in the literary world that grab your attention, keep you enthralled, and refuse to let you stop reading.  I read this book and literally did not sleep one night because I was too busy trying to finish the book.  But what makes this book so rare is not because of how good it is, but it's because how good everything is until the very end.  That's right, the incredible cop-out of an ending made me mad enough to hate the entire novel.  This is "deus ex machina" in its finest form.  This is unexcusable in my opinion.  I just don't get it.  I just don't understand how one can (seemingly) work so hard on a work of fiction only to screw everyone in the final pages.  I gave it two stars (as opposed to one) for fooling everyone into reading through this book.  This is by far and away my most dissappointing reading ever+books
"secrets" revealed+P+The Reiki techniques are presented in a simple easy to understand format. I appreciated the author sharing the healing and psychic attunements; other Reiki authors only mention them and never explain how they are performed+books
Benedict's Three Points+P+Ruth Benedict's The Chrysanthemum and the Sword is an anthropological study of Japanese culture during World War II.  It was her job to "spell out what the Japanese were like." (3)  One of the great aspects of this book is that Benedict's main arguments hold true even to this day.  Although many of her examples may be a bit outdated from our modern perspective, her conclusions drawn from those examples are still valid. However, due to the time that it was written, 1944-6, Benedict was unable to study in Japan.  Instead, she had to rely on articles already written about Japan and interviews with Japanese immigrants.  In doing so, Benedict is able to draw three major conclusions about the Japanese: Japanese society is hierarchically structured, but in such a way that allows class mobility; that everyone has a debt, or &#24681; (on), they must repay to the world; their particularistic society allows them to easily adapt to almost any situation.  For example, Benedict tells us that hierarchy is one of the key aspects of Japanese society, so much so that they have "what is called a `respect language.'" (47)  This means that forms of speech are altered to reflect the status of the speaker compared to the listener.  Before the Meiji Restoration, the Emperor was at the top of the hierarchy, followed by the Shogun, daimyo, samurai, farmers, artisans, merchants and finally the outcasts.  Japan operated in this hierarchical order for hundreds of years and it worked very well.  As a result of this, the Japanese people learned that as long as they did not do anything outside this order "they could trust their world." (70)  It was a system which "guaranteed security so long as one followed the rules." (73)  Although the Meiji Reform attempted, in part, to do away with these class distinctions, it was not terribly successful: Samurai became powerful bureaucrats, merchants still became more and more wealthy, farmers were farmers, and the outcasts were still looked down upon - despite their emancipation.  The same can be said even of today's Japan.  The elite families such as Mitsubishi and Mitsui are still very powerful.  Due to their integral role in Japan's economy, they are able to sway Diet members' opinions their way. Another unique aspect of Japanese hierarchy, Benedict tells us, is that it allows for class mobility.  Just because one is born a merchant's son does not mean one has to always be a commoner.  As merchants during the pre-Meiji era became wealthier, they were able to marry into samurai families.  In this way, the "merchant's descendants become samurai" and the samurai family marries into more money. (72)  Although this still occurs today between wealthy and prestigious families, there is also another way to move up and gain social prestige.  By studying hard and getting into the best schools, one can be sure of a secure future.  If one graduates from Tokyo University, it would be very difficult to not find a good job.  In this manner, even a lowly farmer's second son can be an important man. One point that should be made clear about the Japanese hierarchy is that the American view of hierarchy is not quite correct.  Americans views it as a very rigid and controlling way of life - indeed it is.  However, the authority that a father exerts on his family or a Shogun over the nation is not dictatorial.  The opinions and well-being of the entire group are taken into consideration before any decisions are made.  "The master of the house saddles himself with great difficulty" if he acts purely according to his own will. (55) Benedict's second main observance of the Japanese is their sense of &#24681;, or indebtedness, and the need to repay it.  The Japanese believe, she tells us, that when a child is born, he is immediately indebted to the Emperor and will never be able to repay even a one-ten-thousandth of it back.  The child is also indebted to his parents.  Only after becoming one "does he know how indebted he is to his own parents." (102)  Tied directly to this idea is virtue.  In Japan, repaying ones debts is a very important part of life.  One must always be careful to remember &#24681; to the Emperor and the parents.  Therefore, it is considered a virtue when one works toward repaying any debts and as a burden to acquire more.  This sense of repaying someone continues even now.  It is evident in gift giving practices in which an employee gives a boss a New Year's present as a way of paying him back for employment.  Also, when a guest visits a family he will often bring &#12362;&#37202; (sake) or some other small present as repayment for burdening the family.  A peculiar side-effect of &#24681; is that people do not often help strangers in need.  To do so would be to give that person &#24681; they would likely not be able to repay. Benedict's final insight into the Japanese culture is their ability to adapt to almost any situation.  The most obvious example of this is their attitude toward the Occupation.  When the Emperor announced the unconditional surrender of Japan, the Japanese considered it a natural course of events and "accepted all that such a fact implied." (305)  There are numerous stories of the politeness showed to American troops upon arrival in Japan.  Even the fact that there were no resistance forces or sabotage attempts during the Occupation is a strong testament to this ability.  "Japan's real strength," Benedict says, "lies in her ability to say..., `That failed,'" and take a completely different path. (304)  Benedict then says Japan "could make herself indispensable in the commerce of the East," which could not be closer to the truth. (314)  Japan's economy boomed after the Reconstruction and made it the technological center of the world.  Of course, anyone could make such a prediction given the fact that Japan was no longer allowed to have an army.  All the money that had been poured into the military could now be directed elsewhere. Overall, I believe The Chrysanthemum and the Sword accomplishes Benedict's goal of describing the fundamentals of Japanese culture and is a great addition to the existing literature on Japan.  As I have previously stated, some of her examples are indeed old-fashioned (i.e. the stern mother-in-law and the tale of Hachiko) and may appear irrelevant to the study of modern Japan; however, what she is able to draw from these examples is still applicable.  We should consider that even though America today is much different than the America of the `40's, the same sorts of principles are held today - this can also be said of modern Japan+books
Great Story; Very depressing, but very well written.+P+The Corrections is the tale of the Lambert family, a pretty standard late 20th century Midwestern family.  Alfred Lambert, the father, suffers from an array of old-age medical disorders. His wife, Enid, lives in denial of his (and her own) problems and thrusts her frustration upon their now-grown children:  Chip, the failed academic turned New York screenwriter, Denise, the sexually confused upscale cook in Philadelphia and Gary, the maritally frustrated investment banker in Philly.  The plot follows the three children's lives as the fall apart, seemingly in sync with the collapse of Alfred's health.  The story is driven by Enid's desire to have her three children return home for Alfred's "last" Christmas.  Franzen does an amazing job of carefully winding the story together, introducing fun moments of "aha!" to the reader.  Recurring themes and motifs include mind altering drugs, the boom of the late 1990s, and the former Soviet Bloc.  Secondary characters connect primary characters together via seemingly random (yet believable) relationships.  I found this novel an interesting read, but I had a hard time getting through it.  The novel, at times, is horribly depressing.  The relationships of Gary, Denise, and Chip are painful to read, although maybe that's what makes this novel so captivating at times - you can really identify with the characters.  I think, at one point or another, we've all been a Gary, Denise, Chip or Enid+books
Danielle Give  me a break+N+My husband has a theory that Danielle Steel has a dart board and each circle surrounding the center is labeled either, falls in love, loses family member, has death of loved-one,fights for life of herself or loved one, loses partner,business or spouse. He feels when she is at a loss she justs throws off a dart and whatever she hits becomes the outline for her next book.  I have been a loyal fan for many many years and take his kidding with a smile and secretly pray he's not right.  This book proved me wrong and he was right all these years. It was so obvious from the first few pages what was happening that I was certain I had read this story before somewhere. After having waited  long time to get this book from my local library I was so disappointed that it was so poorly written and so badly not thought through I couldn't even read it completely, but skipped sections to finish it, knowing what was going to happen before I got to it.  +books
Save your time! Save your money!+N+If there was something less than a "one star rating" this book would qualify! Just a terrible collection of short stories going nowhere. Very dis-jointed. Very wordy. I kept reading to the end, in hopes of finding some kind of conclusion. The only conclusion found is to share the bad experience, in hopes of saving others from some pain and frustration! I'll never read Peter Straub again! Ugh+books
Doors that go nowhere+N+Initially, I was excited to pick up a collection of short stories by Straub. But, this has got to be my least favorite of all of Straub's work. Every story seems disjointed an incomplete. I never got a full sense of what happened by the time i finished each story. I kept reading the book, however, in hopes of finding a gem. I came close with &quot;Mrs. God&quot;, but again felt let down on the outcome. Each story is too much buildup and not enough delivery. I was glad to finish this book and put it back on the shelf. Despite the positive reviews, I was not impressed+books
Breathtaking+P+I don't know how I missed this jewel until now, but I'm glad I finally found it.  I haven't been this moved by a work of fiction in a long, long time.  I found myself so drawn to Charlie and to what was happening to him, to his longing for acceptance and love, and to his quest to make sense of his world.  The desire for acceptance and love--from oneself and from others--is something all people have in common regardless their IQ.  I cried as Charlie regressed, all the while knowing what was happening to him, realizing the profundity of his loss, yet finally being grateful for the short period of intellect and what that contributed to science.    I can't disagree more with the reviewer who says the book's ending was predictable.  For a while, I thought the book would be about the trick of combining great intellect with human love.  When Fay put the female mouse in with Algernon, I kept waiting to see if this theme would be played out, first with the mouse, later with Charlie.  One possible ending would have been to let Charlie have his high IQ but, unlike Algernon, be able to integrate intellect with emotion.  Another ending would have been to go back to the lower IQ, and have a completely sterile existence devoid of anyone.  This of course did not happen as the people at the bakery also showed growth by the book's end and were able to truly take Charlie in and befriend him.  I think the author came up with a good ending by causing Charlie to lose the intellect, but to have gained self-love and the love of others, things he did not have at the start of his journey. +books
A fine work of literature that can stand alongside any in English+P+I just reread it recently as an adult. I had this boxed set of three hardcover E.B. White books when I was a kid - Charlotte's Web, The Trumpet of the Swan (which I remember as my favorite of the three, though I hardly remember it today), and Stuart Little.   I was so happy when the cheap paperback they ordered here was the same printing - same illustrations and everything. Anyway, coming back to it as an adult (or sort of adult) was surprising - it was so beautifully laid out, the tone, the story, the dark deep themes - as a short novel, it stands with the best of literature. I know there's no such thing as a "perfect" novel, but as far as any literary criteria can be applied, it is absolutely beautiful - symmetrical in all the right places, gentle as it deals with the harshness of life, all the dark undertones - the sheep in the background with their collective understated cruelty, Templeton the amoral hedonist, the cruelty of time that makes little girls grow up - and yet somehow tenderness persists.   It's elegant and real and cosmic and full of quaint Americana. Certainly not only for children. A fine novel by any standards+books
Night of Many Dreams+N+I cannot recommend this novel to any reader.  It had too many aspects of the countless, over-the-top feminist rants that are becoming so tiresome.  It was predictable that one of the few decent men in the story was dispatched toward the end so that the women could resume their life together.  The history, the relationships and the settings were unbelievable.+books
Compelling Coming-of-Age Tale+P+The title of this novel would lead one to believe that it's about the life of a student in college, but that's not exactly the case.  Sure, part of it takes place at college, but in truth it's more of a coming-of-age story;  a young man's attempt to reconcile his working class, suburban upbringing with the wealth and intellectual glamour he discovers at prestigious Yale University.  It's a well-told and compelling tale, and, like other Perrotta novels, leaves one with something to think about at its end.   We meet Danny in his junior year as he is finally coming into his own.  He's established himself intellectually, he's got new and interesting friends, and he's even a bit of a celebrity in that he's an integral part of a newly-minted literary magazine.  It's now been more than two years since he came to school and his home-town ties are slowly disintegrating.  But some are more difficult to abandon than others.    His father, for one, owns a lunch truck, or roach coach.  In a mid-life change of careers, he's decided to become his own man, to run his own business.  But it is stressful work, and damaging to his health.  Danny finds that he must spend all his vacation time helping him.  Then there is the girl Danny met from his old high school.  She's a secretary now, at a run-of-the-mill, small industrial plant.  He goes out with her knowing full well that the relationship will never blossom into anything.  He is aware he is using her.    Although Danny is doing well, grade-wise, he is painfully aware of all of the shenanigans going on around him, some of which he participates in.  A girl has basically moved into his suite with one of his roommates.  Other roommates smoke dope.  Another spends his time in fascination with assassins of American presidents.  Everybody drinks way, way too much.  One evening, while cavorting with a female on the campus grounds, he is ridiculed by a student-actor dressed as the "fool" from Shakespeare's King Lear.  Is this why our parents spend thousands and thousands of dollars a year?  He thinks.  With his background, he is able to view these goings-on through the eyes of the average working-stiff American, and without ever explicitly saying why, finds that he is ashamed.  His actions, sometimes reckless, sometimes foolish, seem to indicate a subconscious desire to be punished.  This conflict is unresolved by novel's end.    It is unlikely that this novel will ever win a Pulitzer Prize, or even be nominated for one.  There is no huge encompassing theme, there are no substantial truths revealed, there is no scathing indictment of society.  None of that.  It is, however, a tautly told, bright, compelling narrative with characters one would expect to meet in real life.    It is, frankly, the type of thing which present-day aspiring authors should strive for.  The average reader is not interested in being dazzled by an author's research or bombarded with symbolic references to Freud, he is interested in being told a good story.  If an author does this well enough and often enough, all of those other elements--the ones which make a novel great--will fall into place.  Indeed, they did so in Mr. Perrotta's most recent effort, the excellent Little Children.  Joe College works because, at the very least, it is a fine example of the art of storytelling. +books
We love Eric Carle, but this book is stupid!!!+N+What happened???  All we got was, "have you seen my cat?"  "you are not my cat."  "Have you seen my cat?"  "You are not my cat."  What's the point of this???  Seems like Eric Carle just wrote anything to make a buck.  Stupid dumb book!!!  Waste my money!!+books
I agree with Everett -- the audio version is terrible+N+I wish I had followed Everett Logan's advice and skipped this cassette. You can tell that the material itself is great, but the narrator is terrible, terrible, terrible. He dumbs down the text. I bought this to give to someone recuperating from surgery, but decided to listen to it myself first. I'm glad I did -- I would have been embarrassed to give this to anyone+books
Great concepts that go nowhere.+N+I zipped through the first 100 pages of this book unable to put it down.  Unfortuneately the author seems to run out of gas after that.  The main character just goes on a big, boring sight seeing tour.  It reminded me of that show on the Travel Channel where that girl visits hotel after hotel fawning over the interior design. There is not a hint of conflict until the final pages and then it's very short-lived and quickly followed by one of the worst non endings I've ever read.  The book just stops.  Not a hint of resolution or even a cliff hanger pointing to a sequel.  It's a shame because Grimsley had some great concepts to work with.  In my experience novels that mix technology with magic usually fail at both, but Grimsley had a workable foundation he could have developed into something unique if he had focused on the SF concepts instead of minutiae.    Once in a while the characters stop admiring the drapes long enough to notice the GIANT FREAKIN' PORTAL BETWEEN TWO WORLDS--but enough about that.   Gee, what a lovely sofa..+books
where's the beef?+N+The animal rights issue is a tricky one, because it touches on really deep questions about what it means to be conscious, to have rights, and to experience suffering.  So you might expect a philosopher to be able to sort through the ethical issues and suggest a way forward.  If so, you would be disappointed by this book.  The first chapter lays out the philosophical foundation of the book.  Singer argues that there's really no basis for assigning equal rights to all humans, since different humans have different abilities.  Therefore equality must be based on the recognition of another person's interests.  Since animals have interests too, they deserve equal treatment.  That's it.  It's not terribly deep, and frankly not even rational, but Singer doesn't bother to elaborate.  So if animals have interests, then they obviously have an interest in not suffering.  How do we know animals are capable of suffering?  According to Singer there are two signs:  they seek to avoid painful stimuli and they have nervous systems that bear a superficial similarity to those of humans.  He doesn't say how he came up with these criteria, but they seem awfully generous to me.    In fact, based on those criteria one would conclude that monkeys are capable of understanding spoken language and that humans are capable of echolocation.  Monkeys do in fact respond to certain vocalizations, and they have all the relevant physiological structures for understanding speech.  And humans actually can echolocate (with a lot of practice).  The point is that you would never seriously compare human echolocation to bat echolocation, and the ability of monkeys to process speech is negligible relative to that of humans.  Could this also be true of the capacity for pain and suffering?  I don't think anyone knows, and Singer doesn't shed any light on the subject.  The next chapter is about animal testing, and a lot of the chapter deals with the use of animals in scientific experiments.  This is the weakest part of the book.  Singer finds some of the most gruesome experiments in science history, and juxtaposes them with out-of-context quotes from the researchers to make it look like the research was useless.  He mentions in passing that the vast majority of animal experiments don't involve pain, but by the end of the chapter he suggests that all medical experimentation should eventually be stopped.  Part of his justification for ending medical experiments is the notion that such experiments don't actually contribute to medical or scientific progress.  This idea is unfortunately quite common among people who don't know anything about medicine or science.  However it's completely incorrect, and most of Singer's arguments regarding the scientific value of animal testing have been completely debunked.  For example, he continues to exploit the thalidomide tragedy, even though it was already known at the time the book was written that that incident was unrelated to animal testing.  In addition to being totally confused about science, Singer seems uncomfortable with the scientific method itself.  He repeatedly suggests that animal testing should, in the short term, be limited to experiments that will lead to rapid advances in medical treatment.  This is like saying you should look for your lost car keys where you left them.  Science doesn't work this way.  At one point (p. 47), Singer complains about a series of experiments that were shown "first to prove a theory, then to disprove the theory, and finally to support modified versions of the original theory."  This probably sounds ridiculous to a philosopher, but it's actually a pretty good description of the scientific method.  The next chapter deals with factory farming, and here Singer is on firmer ground.  As in the previous chapter, there's no philosophy, or even rational discourse.  It's just page after page of description, in this case of the conditions of animals on a large farm.  However, in contrast to the chapter on experimentation, the conditions he describes are standard practice for the majority of farm animals.  Here it would seem that there's plenty of room for improvement with comparatively minimal consequences for humans (although I imagine the situation has only gotten worse since the publication of the second edition of the book in 1990).  The next chapter deals with vegetarianism, calling for a boycott of meat and dairy products.  Again the appeal is basically emotional, and if you were moved by the arguments of the preceding chapter, you will presumably find this chapter convincing.  Curiously Singer doesn't call for a similar boycott of medicine or medical treatment, even though the argument would be identical.  Even if you belief that animal experimentation is useless for human medicine, you have to admit that the purchase of such medicine directly pays for more animal research.  Anyone who's receiving treatment for cardiac problems or diabetes, or who has ever had surgery, or who takes prescription drugs, is contributing to animal suffering.  Maybe Singer deals with this in another book, but given the chapter on vegetarianism it's a rather obvious omission.  The next chapter is a strangely out of place history of human attitudes toward animals, going back several thousand years.  It might have made sense to put this at the beginning of the book, but perhaps his editor was afraid of losing readers.  The last chapter talks about some popular animal rights movements and their accomplishments.  Singer doesn't draw any line between violent organizations like the Animal Liberation Front (which the FBI considers a terrorist organization) and organizations that actually help animals in a peaceful way (like the ASPCA).  He speaks positively of PETA, which in addition to other extremist activities, supports violence and arson.  I don't know why he would do this.  Ultimately this is a bad book.  It trivializes a serious issue by  substituting emotional imagery for rational argumentation.  The fact is that humans can benefit greatly from actions that adversely affect animals.  In the realm of science, there is no serious doubt that the length and quality of human life have been improved through animal testing.  With other behaviors, such as meat-eating, the benefits are more subjective and the suffering is probably greater.  How we assign weight to these costs and benefits is a very difficult question that Singer doesn't even attempt to take seriously+books
The book that started it all!+P+In this particular edition of the Communist Manifesto, the reader is treated to an introduction by Leon Trotsky, one of the central leaders of the Russian Revolution as well as some correspondence from Marx and Engels.  But it is the Manifesto itself which bears repeated readings and discussion. How could such a short work have been the basis for revolutions around the world?  It is due I think to the fundamental points made: i.e. that workers of the world must unite---as they have more in common with each other than their own national rich and powerful.  In very brief but cogent explanations, Marx and Engels give a concise history of mankind and prove that all history in the "history of class struggles".  Be it feudal lords and serfs or autoworkers and General Motors, it is still the truth.  If you can't get this book from Amazon, try books by Pathfinder under the "new and used" button above+books
boring+N+I am glad to see I am not the only one who thought this book was bad. I listened to it on audio cassette and kept waiting for a plot to come along. I can't even imagine the author finding it at all interesting.  I was expecting at least something of entertainment value having read a couple of her other books that were good+books
Lao's review+P+The Secret History is a record of the Mongolian Royal families, which is thought to have been written during the thirteenth century.  Paul Kahn has kept the original prose format in his translation, which I feel makes this the only version to own.  It begins with the creation myth of the wolf and deer from which the Mongolian people (in legend) are descended from; throught he birth of Temujin, and ending with the ascention to the throne of Ogedai Khan. I highly recommend this to those who are looking for primary sources to add to their Asian history collections+books
She's Right - It Could Happen to You+P+This is an honest, funny, and sweet memoir of pregnancy and the first year as a parent. Brockenbrough takes us along on her journey as she lives the ups and downs of life as a new parent. It's sometimes funny, sometimes endearing, but always entertaining. Brockenbrough is not as outrageous as Jenny McCarthy, which is a good thing, because her book will appeal to everyone. It could be you in this book, for all intents and purposes, and reading someone else's first experience with parenthood is sure to arm a new mom with insights and hope.+books
Captures the nature of the dilemma extremely well+P+Tuch is very insightful in his observations about this syndrome.  Having been involved in this kind of relationship myself in the past, I can say that his description of how these relationships progress is VERY familiar.  This book will provide well-needed understanding by all involved parties.  This understanding is crucial in order to get unentangled from this kind of relationship...or transform the unhealthy agendas/perspectives that often permeate the relationship and give the relationship a chance to either end or work out+books
Europe is so wonderful! So picturesque! (Too bad it's inhabited by all those Europeans.)+N+In 1990 Bill Bryson set out to "do Europe". He says that his motivation was to relive his experiences from tours in Europe in 1972 and 1973 when he was a young student wandering around Europe with a backpack.  In reality it seems as if the primary reason for Bill Bryson to do this trip was so that he could then write a funny book about the trip.  "Neither Here Nor There" is, in fact, a very funny book, at least in the beginning. Bill Bryson can describe situations in a very humorous way, and he's willing to make fun of himself, as well as everything around him.  Unfortunately, after a while the humor wears thin. Then it wears very thin. Then you begin to dissect the humor, and realize that you've been had.  Bill Bryson's method of traveling is to emulate the kind of tourism we all like to ridicule. He typically arrives by train in a new city in the evening. He has no hotel reservation so he has to spend time finding a hotel that is not really what he wanted. He sees "the sights" that one is supposed to see in that city. He makes no effort to get in touch with the local people, to learn about their lives, or to understand their country and society. He spends typically 2-3 days in each city and then goes to work on figuring out how to get to the next city or country on his list, which often leads to further complications.  This is obviously not the way to travel if you're writing a travel book. Nobody in their right mind would want to read about this kind of traveling.   But Bill Bryson is not writing a travel book, he's writing a funny book, and he has a sure-fire recipe:  1. Do things in problematic ways, and then make fun of all the trials and tribulations that result.  2. Mix in lots of flashbacks to the trips of your youth, with much juvenile humor related to the drives that young men are so driven by.  3. Feign incomprehension about everything foreign and satirize everything that is unfamiliar.  4. Make funny remarks intended to reinforce national prejudices.  This last type of humor can be especially tiring. Here are a few examples to illustrate what I mean:  "Let's face it, the French Army couldn't beat a girls' hockey team." (pg 32)  "The (German) women still don't shave their armpits. ... They all look so beautiful and stylish, and then they lift up their arms and there's a Brillo pad hanging there." (pg 91)  "In Norway, three people and a bottle of beer is a party; in Sweden the national sport is suicide." (pg 97)  "But the most preposterous law of all, a law so pointless as to scamper along the outer reaches of the surreal, is the Swedish one that requires motorists to drive with their headlights on during the daytime." (pg 110)  "I love the way the Italians park. You turn any street corner in Rome and it looks as if you've just missed a parking competition for blind people." (pg 123)  In conclusion, if you're someone who "did Europe" in your youth and you want to relive fond memories in a humorous way, then you may well like this book. Most other readers will probably start out laughing, then smiling, then wondering why the jokes seem to have lost their appeal, and finally ending up wishing they'd picked a real travel book or a real humorous book.

Of Two Minds, Again+N+The story is quite clunky and contrived, and yet, I still can't help but feel some affection for it, as, despite my opinions of Mr. Roeder's talents, he clearly feels deeply for his characters, and their none-to-realistic world.  The good things are here--while the characters are cardboard cut-outs, and the fact that the two couples are essentially dopplegangers, their plight is still quite a bit involving.  My negatives, though, really spring from the way the plot unfolds--far too quickly and far too coincidental.  I know that the chamber of horrors at the "mental hospital" is not far removed from reality, but for a lot of the story, the amazing circumstances that abound in the novel are a bit too much to bear.  And I can't quite parse the way Mr. Roeder attempts to ground his characters in a realistic setting, and then throws on paranormal experiences.  As escapist literature, I've read worse, but for something that seems to be striving towards realism, I just don't know+books
Build your Own Earth Oven+P+After attempts to research how to build an Earth Oven, this was the only good literature I found on the subject+books
2005's Most Dishonest Book+N+I can't speak with authority about other deseg cases, but I AM knowledgeable about the St. Louis case, having spent four years on the St. Louis Board of Education (1989 - 1993.).  Simply put, deseg has destroyed the St. Louis Public Schools (SLPSs), which were arguably, the best large public school system in the nation prior to deseg, when they were segregated and run by white Lutherans.  Today, after 26 years of deseg, the SLPSs are probably no more than one year from losing their state accreditation and being taken over by the state of Missouri. Let's consider some facts rather than the disinformation of dilettantes and poseurs such as Kozol:   COSTS  Deseg has cost the State of Missouri about $8 Billion between the Kansas City and St. Louis cases. The bill in K.C. totaled about $3.5 Billion when it finally ended, while the St. Louis case has almost certainly passed the $4 Billion mark. (These statistics are scrupulously hidden by the leftist news media.) What have we realized from this expenditure?  First of all, state money diverted to these two deseg cases was stolen from every school district in Missouri not participating in a deseg case. Small, rural school districts routinely spend between $4,000 and $5,500 per pupil each year. In St. Louis, the per-pupil expenditure has been as high as $11,711: Yet, those rural, so-called "out-state" districts do a far better job of educating and graduating students, despite having half the resources. (I'm sure in Kozol's mind they are merely "goyim," and deserve no better...)  Ironically, while less affluent "out-state" districts were robbed of state funding by deseg, the wealthier school districts in St. Louis County experienced a massive WINDFALL from deseg: Since they are reimbursed by the state the AVERAGE per-pupil cost for each city transfer, (rather than their "marginal" cost,) wealthy districts such as Clayton, Ladue and Parkway benefited from a massive infusion of new revenues, although these school districts have traditionally out-spent almost every other Missouri district by a factor of three or more. (For example, Clayton currently spends about $15,000 per pupil per year.)   ACHIEVEMENT  In the SLPSs, half the students test at the 20th percentile or lower on nationally standardized tests. This stat would be even worse, except that (I am told) the "LD" (or "learning disabled") kids do not take the standardized tests. There are legions of LD kids...  In a rare moment of wisdom and sobriety, a federal judge sitting on our deseg case ordered a test of its efficacy in the early 1990s. That study, called the "Lissitz Study" revealed that city students (i.e., black students) bused to predominately white county school districts improved less academically than did every other category of student in the SLPS. That is, they improved less than students in all-black, the "naturally"-integrated, and "magnet" schools.  When the Educational Testing Service still "normed" the SATs between 400 and 1600, the average SLPS student had a combined SAT of 760. Worse yet, these were the best and most motivated students, with further educational aspirations, who "self-selected" themselves to take the SATs and were therefore, a highly "skewed" sample relative to the average SLPS student.    Deseg is almost universally motivated by the laughable paradigm that, if we throw enough money at our inner-city schools, black kids will achieve at a level commensurate with white kids. Now that even William Coleman has repudiated his own research on this subject, ("The Coleman Report," cited in "Brown v. Board,") Kozol and deseg's other defenders could spend their time far more productively by studying the lessons of "The Bell Curve" in order to understand academic disparities between the races.  VESTED INTERESTS  It has been remarked that the defenders of deseg will never relent until the last white kid has been driven from the system. This is because the NAACP Legal Defense Fund is a "co-plaintiff" in most (if not ALL) U.S. deseg cases, and is periodically distributed "legal expenses" by the federal courts. These are a very important source of revenue to the NAACP, which has experienced declining membership and numerous financial scandals over the last several decades.  Similarly, deseg has meant a great deal more than the mindless expenditure of billions to bus students around. One of the most injurious elements of the St. Louis deseg plan has been a massive affirmative-action program for administrators and teachers. The SLPSs now employ more functionally illiterate individuals than the N.B.A., and have become nothing less than an employment agency for lazy and incompetent blacks with political connections.   Essentially, the same black women who, 30 or 40 years ago were employed in middle-class households as "domestic" help, are now SLPS teachers and administrators. ("I is a teacher.") How anyone who never really absorbed a high school education could be presumed able to teach mystifies all but Kozol and deseg's other defenders. If teachers and administrators in the SLPSs were required to take the S.A.T.s, more than half would test significantly below average: We know this because they have already demonstrated the fact!  Approximately half of all SLPS teachers and about 60% of its administrators attended Harris-Stowe State Teacher's College, which has the second lowest academic standards of any institution of "higher learning" in Missouri. Last time I called their admissions office, I was told that Harris-Stowe accepted applicants with a combined SAT of 780. It should come as no surprise that recent measures of SLPS student SATs do not differ significantly from those of many of their teachers.   HYPOCRISY  A truly fascinating phenomenon I have observed is that there seem to be few defenders of deseg among those whose kids actually participated in such a program. It doesn't take a parent long to understand that deseg isn't so wonderful when your kid gets rolled for his lunch money every day, or your daughter gets beaten up because she won't date outside her race.   Now Kozol may not have kids, but I'll just bet that if he does, they did not participate in any voluntary deseg programs, if any were available where he resides. (The Jews are mustard for this sort of thing, as long as they are merely allowed to posture and it doesn't actually cost them anything...)  I once had the rare opportunity to sit next to Dr. Susan Uchitelle, the  Jewish woman who headed the St. Louis Deseg's "Voluntary Inter-district Coordinating Council" throughout the 1980s and 1990s. (She was paid $60,000 per year, but from what I could discern, her sole responsibility seemed to be running interference with the news media, so the rubes out there wouldn't get the wrong idea about the joys and benefits of deseg whenever there was a stabbing, gun-shot incident, murder, or race riot.)  I considered it an "opportunity" because I was able to ask her a question that no one had ever had the impertinence to ask of her before: "Have any of your children participated in the voluntary transfer program?" (That is, were her kids, who would have been "poster children" for the county-to-city deseg program, allowed to transfer from their all-white county schools in order to be voluntarily bused to inner-city schools?)   What do you think was the answer, oh gentle reader? Your response to this question may have far-reaching implications for your understanding of the world around you and some varieties of its inhabitants, such as Jonathan Kozol...   (I'll give you a hint: Susan Uchitelle's attitude toward deseg is very much like Leona Helmsley's attitude toward taxes...)       +books
Blergh+N+I did not like this book. The organization was abysmal, and I decided to sell it back to the college bookstore for use by future hapless students, because it is not good as a reference guide.  I did not like how the author seemed to gear the book to an audience that is terrified of their computers or anything dealing with *gasp* math+books
Truthiness Isn't Good Enough+N+This was given to me by a religious friend who thought I might be able to find some value in Christianity in Borg's "new paradigm."  What Borg's book amounts to is that Borg admits that Christianity is not historically or factually true, but he thinks the "truthiness" of Christianity (to borrow Stephen Colbert's term) is good enough.  By treating Christianity and concepts like being "born again" as metaphors, he tries to escape the problem of having to defend the actual truth of Christianity.  As a Christian apologist, he gives away the store, but then claims it's worthwhile to come into the empty store because it will give you a warm feeling.  For Christians who don't really believe in Christianity, but want to rationalize why they attend church, this might be what they need to hear.  But I don't think many people who don't see the point of Christianity to begin with will be convinced.  For me, you should either be rational in deciding what you believe or admit that you're being irrational in your religious beliefs and are just going by your gut anyway.  This kind of half-way house between the two just doesn't do anything for me+books
Dr. Dossey seems to view . . .+P+existence and perception in a phenomelogical sense; that is, physical health, emotional well-being, and spiritual contentedness are ways of describing aspects of one single, non-local reality. He advocates an approach to Western allopathic medicine which seriously examines the  conditions of one's emotional and spiritual health. Why? Again, the state  of one aspect of a person's reality influences, or perpaps even determines,  the state(s) of the others. Dr. Dossey, in essence, is presenting an  introduction to developing a healthy and homeostatic relationship within  the world of an individual as well as the world in a very universal sense.  A highly recommended read+books
loved it! so much info from another culture.  amazing, scary+P+I knew the cultures were different, just never knew they were this different.  I am anxious to read another book.  Not because I love it, but because I am amazed at who can survive it+books
Unbiblical and bad writing make for one star+N+This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck+books
beautifully written+P+The "Thief Lord" is a wonderful contemporary story full of loss, beauty, adventure and a little bit of magic.  Cornelia Funke's book has one several literary prizes and even bumped Harry Potter off the best sellers list in Germany and Northern Europe for a time.  It never talks down to kids and is engaging to adults as well.  The imagery of Venice is dead-on (just like I remembered) and the characters(Prosepero, Scipio) are richly portrayed.  This is a story that is light on the fantastic but heavy on imagery and imagination just like the classics!  The main protaganists are boys but boys and girls can enjoy this book equally as there are a few standout female characters also.  Geared to young readers 8-12 and also adults+books
Pure Beauty+P+I cannot rave enough about this book; certainly I have not been moved like this by a literary work in some time.  Gorgeous from start to finish- sometimes whimsical, sometimes heartbreaking, always intelligent, fresh, and full of magic.  Clarke's writing is impeccable and a pure joy to read. One always has the sense that she's subtly mocking her characters even as she allows us to love (or hate!) them.  The story is breathtaking and moves along with exquisite pacing.  Allow yourself to be lost in her world!    +books
Fat Kid Rules the World+N+When I picked this book up, I expected it to be interesting.  As a fat kid, I thought I would enjoy the story, thinking that I would feel connected to the main character.  Boy, was I wrong.  In the beginning of the book, Troy, feeling suicidal, wants to throw himself on the tracks, but Curt, a skinny druggie, stops him.  By the middle of the book, I wish Curt had just held back and let Troy jump.  The book was very slow for me; each new chapter sounded like the last.  I read this short book over two weeks because I just couldn't take it.  The end was unsurprisingly predictable.  I mean, I could've told you what was going to happen by the fifth chapter.  Usually, when I read a book, I take something from it, maybe a lesson or a moral.  In this book, I just felt a sense of nonclosure... the ending didn't really do it for me.  Based on the other reviews on this page, you probably think that I'm just a mean person who writes scathing reviews on great books.  The first part may be true, but I only write scathing reviews on things I did not particularly like.  You may not have liked Macbeth, but I sure did.  Whether it's a good book or not is all a matter of opinion+books
Solid crime/mystery/suspense+P+Unlike the first Repairman Jack adventure, THE TOMB, which was horror/science fiction, this one is a straight mystery. Wilson does try his best to shamelessly tug at your heartstrings, tossing in some abandoned babies with AIDS, and also some child pornography. Add a modern-day Japanese samuri, some American mercenaries, some Arab villains, and you've got is a fast-paced novel that could be made into a pretty good movie+books
Too many cooks (even if they are good ones) spoil the broth+N+This book pulls together a lot of information, but in my opinion it is written and organized very very poorly. I have over 10 yrs of experience in in the healthcare industry and came across this book during a grad level course in CEA.  Long, boring, convoluted sentences fill the pages of this book. It took about 3 times more time and effort to get through a page in this book compared to a page in respected journals like JAMA, NEJM, BMJ etc.  If you have lots of time and are doing research in this field - go for it. Alternatively if you want to quickly determine what CEA is about, I would recommend reading Peter Muennig and Kamran Khan "Designing and Conducting Cost-Effectiveness Analyses in Medicine and Health Care"+books
Fascinating+P+I hightly recommend this book. An easy, quick read that could change your life+books
AMAZING+P+This is an incredible piece of work!  It is one of the top 5 BEST and most impacting books that I've ever read (and I've read a lot).  There are so many thoughts and principles that have stuck with me.  This isn't a book you read where you come away wondering what you learned because you can't articulate what you read and/or learned.  With this book, there are amazing teachings. It is much better than so many other books on business, leadership, and life balance.  As an family man, MBA and non-profit student director, his book and my application of its principles have truly left a great impact on my life and in turn the lives of others+books
Great book for chefs but it's not a cookbook +P+This book will tell you what flavors go well with each other, what starch and veggies will match well with a protein, and there are a few recipes.  This book is great for developing your own recipes+books
Great Source on Culinary History,Business, and Lore+P+`The Encyclopedia of Food and Wine in America' is a great 1500 page compilation of excellently written articles on virtually every aspect of the history, education, manufacture, marketing, personalities, and writing about food in America. Practically the only thing it does not include is recipes or cooking. Even sidebars whose label suggests a proper place for a recipe such as the sidebar on shoofly pie gives not one hint about how to make this delicious dessert. Given the size of the subject, it is not at all surprising that the editors have left these out, as both recipes and kitchen science can both be considered without nationality, plus the fact that there are thousands of good cookbooks and a score of books on food science available today, so why not focus on things which are not commonly covered in these books. This means that this volume can sit beside the `Larousse Gastronomique' with only a very small amount of overlap in material. These two giant books have two entirely different objectives. While both works will have articles on potatoes, Larousse will tell you how to cook them, but Oxford will tell us were they are grown, their commercial importance, nutritional importance, and their appearance in cartoons.  So, unlike Larousse, you are much more inclined to simply read the articles in these volumes for your own entertainment as much as for your need to know something. The articles are filled to the brim with interesting trivia about American food. One favorite item in the article about Spam is the fact that the word `Spam' became associated with junk e-mail on the strength of a Monty Python skit which did the same kind of number on Spam as the movie `Blazing Saddles' did on western films. Another discovery was the renaming of sauerkraut to `Liberty Cabbage' after World War I. In this way, the book follows the style of the Encyclopedia Britannica that leans heavily toward long, detailed articles rather than shorter articles with a greater chance of redundancy, especially with a hundred or more independent contributors.  It would probably take the average foodie about five minutes of searching through these volumes to find something they miss. My first sense of something being missing was when there were articles about Charlie Trotter, Alice Waters, and Rick Bayless, but no articles on Thomas Keller, Jeremiah Tower, or Richard Olney. I would not feel the absence so acutely if the editors had given us biographies on Julia Child, James Beard, Craig Claiborne, and M.F.K. Fisher and stopped there, as all four of these figures are so obviously at the very top of the heap in their influence on American eating and food writing. On the other hand, Tower and Olney between them are probably as much an influence on culinary professionals in the United States as Alice Waters. While Olney spent much of his life living in France, he was born in Iowa and all of his most influential works, most notably his editorship of the Time-Life culinary series of books in the 1960s was aimed at American audiences. This series is mentioned twice in the long article on cookbooks with no mention of Olney as the editor, a position recommended to the publishers by James Beard. Regarding Keller and Trotter, for example, both have received the James Beard best chef in the country award and of the books attributed to these two chefs, I much prefer the two from Keller than the three from Trotter which I have reviewed. I suspect the difference in the eyes of the editors is Trotter's earlier ascendancy, his substantial charitable activities, and his better than average culinary instruction TV shows.  These quibbles aside, I am genuinely impressed by the overall quality of the writing in the thousands of articles in this work. The biographical articles all begin with a crisp statement of the importance of the subject to American culinary history. In spite of the very large number of writers, all articles seem to share this same matter of factness, with virtually no sentimentality or sensationalism. One joggling act that must have challanged the editors is how to limit the book to `American' subjects. And, they seem to have accomplished this with great good judgment. In place of any mention of French or Italian or Japanese or Korean or East Indian or Chinese subjects, the editors have given us articles on `Italian-American' food and `German-American' food. I know the German-American culinary world better than any other and I give the author of this article high marks for capturing the big picture and not limiting himself to the very easy subject of the `Pennsylvania Dutch' cuisine. Although the Amish and Mennonite communities of Pennsylvania, Ohio, New York, and the Carolinas are at the heart of the German / American food tradition, the greater German influence is much broader, overlapping, for example, the Jewish-American culinary world and even the influences from France and Italy.  By far the best use for this work is as a starting point for serious culinary research or simply noodling around the literature of cookery for fun. In addition to the articles with their excellent bibliographies, there are appendices on general food bibliography, general wine bibliography, list of food periodicals and web sites, major food subject reference libraries, major food museums, food organizations, and food festivals.  Be warned that in spite of the title, wine gets much less than half the volume of ink spilled in these volumes. I also detected a few minor editing mistakes and omissions. The web site for the cable `Food Network' is listed as www.foodtv.com, but this was changed close to two years ago to www.foodnetwork.com. This little mistake is less easy to understand since the article on Julia Child notes her death which occurred about 6 months ago. Still, this book is a great source of entertainment and information for foodies and foodie scholars.  Expensive, but of high quality as a reference and entertainment.+books
Laughs galore+P+This is the third Bill Bryson travelogue I have read.  This has several laugh-out-loud sections, particularly if you have travelled in the United Kingdom.  It is excellent for relaxing on weekends or on a plane.  If you have never been to the UK and don't know any British people, then don't form all your opinions based on this one book, but Bryson does a good job distilling some of the differences between our nations into an amusing few hundred pages. +books
A missing link for practitioners of "hard" martial arts.+P+Many buyers of this book are undoubtedly practitioners of "hard" arts seeking guidance on application of the more dubious moves of their disciplines in street confrontations. If readers expect to be instructed in realistic applications of Karate or Taekwondo blocks and stances, they may feel misled by the title since such subjects are barely touched upon.  MacYoung's purpose here is a different one. "Hard" arts generally teach practitioners to exchange blows at a certain distance. Grappling arts show how to fight an opponent from a clinch or on the ground. Authors like Geoff Thompson emphasize sizing up a potential attacker and resolving with pre-emptive strikes. What none of these address is how to handle the wild onrush of an attacker who has already initiated his assault and who is not going to stand back and trade blows.  This book aims to make "hard" martial arts street effective not by re-explaining their existing techniques but by filling in certain gaps, principally by applying "soft" blocking and takedown concepts from Wing Chun and Silat. Karate/Taekwondo practitioners may find this difficult to reconcile with their own styles - unless they subscribe to the opinion (not addressed in this book) that the "hard" arts once had a considerable "soft" content, and that movements like those now labelled "blocks" were originally something else altogether - but is a valuable and effective complement nevertheless. The book also includes good advice on the nature of violence and how to avoid it, and emphasizes "winning while escaping".  Stylistically, MacYoung's easygoing tone and humour may or may not please, but behind it is a well written book which succeeds in communicating concept and technique in words. Some sections can at first seem repetitive or difficult to follow (not helped by the lack of clear labelling of photos - my one major gripe), but this is due to the complexity of the concepts examined. This book requires more than one reading to get the most out of it, and will certainly reward those willing to do so.+books
She made a revolution in the conception of what the City should be +P+This book created a revolution in city-planning when it was published in the early sixties. Jacobs loved the city that she saw from her Hudson and eleventh street apartment New York City apartment. This was not the city that the master planners Burnham, Mumford etc idolized. Her city was small stores, and businesses, and the greatest possible diversity of buildings and architectural styles. People doing all kinds of different things. Life on the move. Density and diversity. Short blocks and lots of people out walking on different destinations.  +books
Audio version is a bomb+N+When purchasing audiobooks, I normally follow a simple but very effective rule: never, never, never buy an audiobook read by the author. Even if the author is a talented writer, he/she is invariably a terrible narrator. Always look for audiobooks performed by experienced readers, as in Bryson's own "Notes From a Small Island" and "A Walk in the Woods", read by Ron Mclarty.  In Bryson's case I made a rare exception when I listened to "In a Sunburned Country" - the audio version had received reasonable reviews and his performance was indeed adequately entertaining. For this reason I assumed that "Neither Here Nor There" would be equally enjoyable. I was wrong. Bryson's deadpan monologue makes it sound as though he was bored out of his mind while reading this book. Passages that may have seemed amusing in the written version are herein delivered in a sleep-inducing monotone. The sardonically comedic talent he displayed in his reading of "In a Sunburned Country" is totally lacking. I would recommend this audiobook only as a cure for insomnia+books
How To Inflame The Situation. Should be the title of this book.+N+One parenting acting like a jerk is bad enough. Advising the other parent to act like a jerk is not going to help the children.  Be as kind to yourself, your children and your X as you can. Don't behave like a jerk or make things harder for any reason. Not recommended+books
Only for suckers+N+Who would read all these reviews, and then actually buy this book? This book is an unfair attempt at pandering to the doddling whims of a major portion of our population...the suckers...of which I am obviously one, because I did read the stupid book! It took me almost a year to get through it - one half paragraph at a time before I would fall asleep each night. If it wasn't for Jordan, I'd have a hard time going to sleep at all. It doesn't even deserve 1 star+books
Chronicles of Narnia+P+This is a great journey into Narnia. I enjoyed every book and every chapter.  I know everyone I talked to has read this book as a child, I think they need to re-read as an adult and really dig deeper into each chapter.+books
not worth the paper printed on+N+We are traveling the US for almost a year and have purchased the East as well as the West edition before we started. Besides the fact, that we found only a few nice spots described in those books so far, our comments are as follows:  1. The contents of both editions are outdated - certain camgrounds do    simply not exist any more for years!! 2. The directions are awful if not wrong 3. We spent more diesel on finding the described campgrounds than we saved     not to mention the hazzle, driving around in circles 4. Lots of directions seem to be copied from other books we have and are    as wrong as they are in those 5. Campgrounds indicated in the maps by numbers (icons) are not part of    the book anymore 6. The icons in the maps are close to impossible to read (use a    magnifier)  Overall we can absolutely NOT recommend those books to anybody+books
Didn't like the writing style at all+N+I have never read one of Johansen's books and after reading this one, I'm not likely to read another.  I usually enjoy reading pretty much any type of mystery and am not a literary critic by any means, but I just couldn't get into the story here because of the flowery and cliche-filled writing.  Exclamations such as "dear heaven" and "lord" were repeated over and over again by all characters throughout the book, which doesn't seem to fit with the rest of their conversational tone (it would suit my southern grandma, however).  As another reviewer said, the big mystery of why Daisy wouldn't leave Geneva wasn't particularly mysterious - if she really wanted Jason to leave she could have just told him.  Character development was lacking and I just didn't care that much about them.  I would have liked to hear more about Cynthia and her antics.  I did finish the book because I was curious to know what happened, but I couldn't wait for it to be over.  Sorry, but this was not my cup of tea+books
Cradle and All+N+Of all of James Patterson books he has written and I have read, this is the most disappointing one of all.  Had I known beforehand what this one was about, I would not have bought or read it.  Sorry, J.P. is too good a writer to put out this kind of trash.  Just my opinion!!!!+books
Great Story, what's with the ending?+P+I love this story, I was loving it from page one up until the last comic. I mean here we have a great subtly running plot in Thorpe, Silver, and the deceased Doctor, but then suddenly in the last issue we see none of the three stories resolved. Yes, we are implied strongly that the doctor does away with thorpe, but that isnt good enough, what of Thorpe's Empire, how does Batman find out, and do we ever see the ghost again, maybe we don't, maybe we're better for it. But as for Silver, at least I was sad to see her walk away as yet another Superhero-girlfriend-itis casualty and not have anything more happen along the lines of her life in general, or Batman's general dealing with it. Anyways, at least these were just issues and not an intended mini-series, so all of these qualms are pretty much null and void. As a whole, ITS AN AWESOME STORY+books
History of Google, Not Search Engines+N+Though I'm coming to a review of The Search a year too late, I can explain why. I bought the book on its release, very excited to read some good journalism about the hottest business topic of the day. I was sure that Battelle, who had been chronically his progress on the book on his own blog, would deliver. Halfway through the book (in a matter of three days - a possible sign pointing to its lack of depth) I'm realizing that this is not the case.   Thus far, I have two major gripes with the book. The first is the writing itself.  The book is written in informal magazine style, in keeping with his roots as a "cutting edge" technology writer (having worked for Wired and Business 2.0, magazines that try desperately to be "too cool for the room").   This would be fine enough, except that Battelle has a habit of jumping around from year to year, talking about decisions made by players in Google's history before he actually introduces them. He never fully explains why it was important for Sergey Brin and Larry Page - Google's founders - to resign their chairman and CEO posts, nor does he tell the reader what their new titles are. Battelle also has a habit of reintroducing people several times, a practice which at times seems a cheap way to up his page count. His writing style thoroughly muddles however much thoughtfulness there was to his project. I considered keeping a tally of how many times he used "well" as an interjection, but lost interested after I ran out of fingers.   On page 150 he discusses a lack of managerial prowess on the part of Brin, Page and new CEO Eric Schmidt. According to Battelle, one of Google's investors, John Doerr, insisted that Intuit founder Bill Campbell come on as a leadership coach. Battelle uses an anecdote from journalist John Heilemann's GQ article on Google, which quotes Doerr as saying, "I don't know where the company would be without him." However, Battelle doesn't include any of his own reporting on what Campbell actually did. Neglecting to explain right away what this `miraculous' shift was is, in my own journalistic view, irresponsible. Not to mention that he doesn't include the actual title of Heilemann's article in either the main book or the citations.   Later in the book on page 172, he tries to play the role of not only a technology writer, and search historian, but also media theorist and critic, waxing about how Google ought to be considered a media company - not just a technology company.  In the book's final chapter, Battelle introduces the idea of having several different kinds of information contribute to "perfect search," including every tech writer and journalist's favorite idea, the blog. He bulldozes through a description of the blog and later posits that we have reached the critical mass point, "but we don't know it yet." I suspect that Battelle means that he's savvier than users and other writers and he knows something we don't, but he doesn't explain why he thinks we've reached the tipping point, nor what that means in the overall discussion of what the blog can do.   Though Battelle tries to play his book as a "history of search," it is nowhere near as comprehensive as such a book must be. It is a book that sings the praises of Google, nothing more. However, that the book is a history of Google is fine. The company certainly is interesting and large enough to warrant an historical account and Battelle ought to be forthcoming with his intent. The short discussions he does include of the company's search engine precursors such as Lycos and Alta-Vista need considerable expansion and deserve to be considered as more than also-rans, if he really wants to be considered the historian of search and not just Google's unofficial corporate historian. +books
Try not to drown...+N+If there were a dictionary of queer literature Radclyffe Hall would certainly have a place, somewhere between "Hall, Maurice" and "Hallward, Basil". She deserves this for having written a taboo-breaking novel. She does not deserve this for writing a particularly good one.  When I started reading this book I thought I was going to like it a lot more than I did in the end; I thought Stephen as a child was an adorable little gentleman and I liked the relationship between her parents and how it influenced her life. When I reached her first girlfriend, however, a married woman named Angela Crossby, I was at the edge of the abyss without knowing it.  I realize this book is a product of its time, but never in my life have I heard so many cliches and stereotypes about lesbians - sorry, inverts - from a woman who was a lesbian herself. Inverts have terrible nerves. Inverts wrongly cling to religion. A "real" female invert is masculine and a "real" male invert is feminine, whereas their "normal" lovers are truly heterosexual.  More drama and angst are crammed into the last few chapters of the book than I would have thought possible, and the ending - which I will not reveal - comes out of nowhere and contradicts the personalities of Stephen and her lover Mary as they have been previously established. Anyone with an interest in queer literature should read this to satisfy their curiousity, and to deepen their appreciation for better-written and more realistic fiction. Someone who wants a good novel with an intense romance should not+books
Post-modern science fiction+N+Maybe I'm just not the right demographic for this novel, but I hated the beginning, tolerated the middle and put it down permanently near the end. The model is the Canterbury Tales of Chaucer, but I don't think it works. I just never got interested in the characters enough to care what happened to them and for me, the story--stories, really--never came into focus. I guess the New York Times Book Review should have tipped me off because they compare it to Frank Herbert's Dune and the Foundation series of Asimov, both of which, in my opinion have aged really badly. I never realized how bad Dune was until I saw the awful movie of it.  The fundamental metaphors operating in Hyperion seem to be backwards living. Well, ok, but I just don't see what it is a metaphor for. Nor, by page 473 where I finally gave up, did I care+books
Excellent introduction to the field for physicists+P+Perhaps the best feature of this book is that it aims to convey the theory of Lie algebras and Lie groups to physicists. In doing so, the author is careful to give a very simplistic approach so that one not familiar with  the subject can understand it. Not to say that the book is elementary,  since it builds rapidly into the far more interesting aspects of Lie  Groups. A very good read+books
A blatant attack on Islam on the basis of deliberate lies, misquotations and twisting of the facts+N+If there is one thing that rings true of the editor's review, it's that Robert Spencer is "lawyerly" - but not in the sense the editor meant, rather in the sense that he deliberately twists the facts in order to argue his case despite the facts.  This book is full of misquotations of the sayings of Muhammad (ahadith), and they are obviously deliberate as Mr. Spencer has taken the time to research the ahadith and yet still makes enormous errors in his rendering of them.  He spends a considerable amount of time quoting from the Bible and comparing his interpretation of the Christian doctrine (which I would guess a great many Christains will have issue with, as well) with what he claims to be the message of Islam.  He also spends a great deal of time attempting to assassinate the personality of Muhammad with the argument that Muhammad is the role model for all Muslims - hence by assasinating this personality he hopes to assasinate the character of Islam and all Muslims.  Despite his opening claim that he is not targeting all Muslims, the goal of his book, really, is to draw suspicion upon every Muslim in America from their non-Muslim neighbors.  His basic premise that Islam in essence is a falsehood and that all Muslims have deceived themselves with a backward and dated belief system that has failed to evolve, as he puts it, as Christianity has evolved from its backwardness by reducing the Bible to strictly metaphorical meanings.  The crux of his arguement is that Christianity is able to do this, because, as Christian scholars have shown, the Bible is in fact not the direct word of God,  but the Quran, on the other hand, is taken by Muslims as the direct, revealled word of God and hence there is little or no room for the religion to be re-interpreted.  If one reads (or listens, in the case of the audio book) carefully, though, it will not be hard to find the many instances in which Mr. Spencer contradcits himself.  All in all, it does read like a lawyer making his case in court, where it is Islam itself that is on trial.  Mr. Spencer seems to be trying to establish that the likes of Osama bin Laden are in fact   only following the letter of their religion, and hence Islam is a danger to be feared and reacted to preemtively.  Mr. Spencer seems to have strong political and religious motivations and is a far cry from his claim of being unbiased+books
Very disappointed!+N+I have read all the books n the series and have come to expect an enjoyable light read with a little mystery. I thought the menace in this book overwhelmed the 'light' plots. There are serious themes here - murder, death, kidnapping, and others. Too bad the authors didn't focus more on the light plotlines that reader's look for in these books - Maggie's romance (this came across as ridiculous considering the fact that Maggie and her daughter were being stalked by a convicted murderer) and the Jamie / Max story  (which unfortunately is treated as a throwaway storyline). I also disliked the way the authors abruptly got rid of Destiny - love her character or hate it - she has been in enough books that longtime readers care about her.+books
your head will split open and ooze goop after reading this+N+All I can say is pass me some aspirin. This is a dozy of a bad novel. As it says on the dust jacket, a Supreme Court law clerk grabs a petition and ends up becoming deceased. Its up to the brother to uncover the truth by finding the real killer who had let a poor black man rot away for a crime he did not commit. At the same time the brother contends with mysterious bad guys out to get him and stop the unearthing of the evidence. Not only does he deal with his family, but his brothers friend, a sexy young law clerk herself and the duplicity on the bench she works for.  And that's only the start of the plot.   Its really pretty bad, it descends into mired pretensions and goofy resolutions. The characters are so shallow that you are left with little notion of who they are except for a faint nasty after taste over their conceded ways. Baldacci is along with James Patterson and Dean Koontz one of America's worst authors. If you want an author who writes on a similar vein to this, try one of Harlan Coben's last four or so stand alone thrillers with out the character Myron Bolitar in it. Or for a more sophisticated read, look for Denis Lehane, he wrote the amazing Mystic River, but his PI series located in Boston is pretty good as well.+books
underwhelmed+N+I've heard Al Lee speak before and thought that what he had to say was sensible.  However, although I basically agree with his approach, I just cannot recommend his book.  I found it to be too simplistic and to contain too much filler.  There are many much better real estate investment books out there.  Some specific complaints: * The margins are ridiculously wide; this book is much smaller than it seems. * Some of the appendixes (especially appendix A) contained too much filler. * much of the book is a painfully detailed description of fields in a spreadsheet.  This sort of documentation should be directly in the spreadsheet (where it will be in sync with the latest version of the spreadsheet, etc... rather than in a book.) * When I heard Al speak in person he emphasized new homes and owning property in remote locations if needed (eg, owning property in Dallas even if one does not live there).  The book did not really touch on either of these topics.  That said, I did find a couple parts of this books to be useful or interesting.  These are: * The chapter on Financial Statements was useful; In particular the ways that items for a rental property (like rents due, funds in lender held escrow accounts, property taxes due, etc...) show up on the statements was interesting. * The tip that you can begin advertising a property for rent before you have closed on it. * The tip that you can try to time your lease expiration dates to  be during times when school is out. * The recommendation that you work with a property manager who is willing to / capable of helping you find properties to purchase+books
science-lovers only....+N+ugh.  as a confessed bibliophile, i honestly try to give every single book its due.  but this one was impossible...poetic, but impossible.  barrett attempts to weave these stories about antiquated botanists into one connective tissue but it is too far a stretch.  unless you eat, breath and sleep xylem and phloem, don't waste time trying to pad through this book+books
How I spent my vacation+N+There are two ways I can describe this book: as an assigned essay on &quot;How I Spent My Vacation,&quot; in which it might receive a passing grade in High School; or as a visit by your brother-in-law, the one you never really liked but tolerated for your sister's sake, who shares his superficial ideas as if they were deep insights.  I suppose there are people who will voluntarily submit to either, but I'm not one of them.  The author (he can only be called a writer in the most literal sense) has no insight to speak of, is manifestly incompetent at background research, and lacks any useful power of description.  He really should look up the meanings of words like &quot;masquerade&quot; and &quot;circumvent&quot; before he uses them. . . The real mystery is how something like this ever gets published+books
True Reading and Visual Entertainment+P+The book is simply superb!! The use of those magnificent photos to enhance the story was the crowning glory to a story that I not only believe, but experience in my own spirit. It is time for the glorious feminine to rise again and, hopefully, repair the damage done to humanity by the mutated females - men. Lois C. Web+books
Not his best work+N+As a fan of Frederick Buechner, I found this volume in our church library and secured it anticipating a summer weekend of ecstasy, reading this book on the back porch while sipping lemonade.  I found it disappointing, as he focuses on his  collection of Buechner  family memoribilia.  As hard as he tries to universalize it, making it accessible to all of us, for me, it just didn't work.  And it reads like  a review of one's summer family reunion.  Sorry.  Read his other stuff.  It's great!+books
Disappointing+N+If it wasn't for the fact that I listened to the audio book version during my daily commute to work, I probably would have abandoned this book halfway through.   The end is confusing, and I'm left wanting more, not in a good way+books
Why should people not listen to both sides of the story? +N+=== quote   Pay no attention to the negative criticisms by those who are obviously Moonies. This is should be required reading. Nansook Hong had the courage to endure and to finally escape the clutches of this dangerous cult led by the Korean flake who thinks he's God.  === end   Funny, so people should not listen to the story of those who are still within the UM, why is this?   Also Rev. Moon himself doesn't claim to be God, this is always said by others, Rev.Moon stresses the point without God he would be nothing...+books
Very old and outdated...+N+Don't waste your money on this one!  A vast majority of the websites are no longer valid.  The author really needs to issue a revised edition.  It is rather unfortunate too because it it put together so well and in a easy to use format...it just needs a refresher edition+books
Nice introduction+P+I like John's style in writing this book. When I started studying manifolds, I had little understanding of some of the deep concepts of topology. This book was an excellent introduction.   What is so cool about this book are the exercises, and they are all connected with each other. It makes a sumptuous meal.   The other book on smooth manifolds is definitely on its way to being a classic among beginners+books
Closest thing to Founding Fathers that we have left+P+These days, you don't see many people with the interest or guts to do what Jon Stewart and his co-workers do. In America, the book, they aim to teach misinformed Americans what their government is really about. Many people don't actually know what the heck goes on in the government, nor do they care.  The book, filled with hilarious tidbits, great explanations, and well thought out presentations, aims to make the government interesting. It's got history, how the government works, modern day conflicts, theories, ideas, people, and what our Founders did for this great nation. It should be a book in every classroom and required reading for every citizen.  Jon Stewart and the authors of this book went out on a limb for this. They went against the grain and did what they knew was right. It's our duty as Americans to criticize the government. When there's something wrong and you have the ability to fix it, you have the responsibility to fix it.  Hopefully this has changed America+books
NOT anywhere near as good as the movie.+N+I realize that by writing this review I'll probably have a fatwa issued against me by the comic book fan community, but this graphic novel was a major disappointment.  I came to it because I liked the movie so much.  I found it to be misogynistic and tedious to read (entire paragraphs of text repeated, as if the writer couldn't think of enough to fill out his story).  The artwork was ugly.  The plot lines were sometimes hard to swallow, characters' motivations not believable.  It was the spark of a great idea that the movie producer(s) turned into something excellent+books
Loren Pope was Right!!!+P+After a personal large university experience back in the 60's, I knew that that was not what I wanted for my children.  We found Mr. Pope's book and the lights came on.  Not only did we use the book, but with some diligent work were able to arrange personal counseling sessions with Mr. Pope for both my son and daughter.  We live in Central Texas and my son just graduated from Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington and my daughter is now a senior at Kalamazoo College in Michigan.  They both looked at quite a few schools, both recommended in the book and not:  Grinnell, Reed, Colorado College, Beloit, Lawrence, Colgate, College of Wooster, Williams & Bowdoin.  My son loved Whitman.  It is a beautiful school in a beautiful part of America. It is not easy.  He was challenged.  There is a great respect between the college and the town of 30,000. (To parents: Walla Walla is a great place to visit.  There are 50 wonderful wine tasting rooms in the immediate area.)  My daugher also is happy with her choice at Kzoo.  The winters are cold for a Texas girl, but the personal attention that so many of the professors have given to her and her friends is amazing.  The K Study Abroad Program which is 65 years old and rated among the best in the nation for all colleges was fabulous for her.  She spent six months in Ecuador and loved it.  Our nephew, also from Texas, will be leaving for six months in Thailand in another good program.  Loren was right.  These schools do provide personal attention and are there to make sure their students succeed+books
Good for a skim, that is all+N+This book speculates about both the advance of computer technology in the 21st century and the socio-political response to it.  Although it is peppered with a few interesting notions worth skimming, much of the speculation is unreasonable and philosophically naive.  In the first chapter, Kurzweil attempts to lay a sort of theoretical framework for his speculations, which boils down to his belief that Moore's Law is just one instance of a cosmic principle of exponential advance which explains everything from the first second of the universe after the Big Bang to the evolution of life on Earth and now the evolution of technology.  The second chapter argues that it is possible for an intelligence to create something more intelligent than itself:  just as evolution "intelligently" created us, we will (soon!) create computers which will build machines of far greater cognitive ability than us.  It is indeed intriguing to consider that someday machines will outperform humans in many ways, but the book to this point is best skimmed, because there's actually very little substance and a lot of dry, pseudo-intellectual filler.  Chapter 3 examines the philosophical problem that is going to be brought to the forefront by super-advanced computers:  what is consciousness, and can machines possess it?  Kurzweil unimpressively touches on a handful of schools of thought here (his sentences on Descartes made me wonder if he has read anything on the subject besides pop philosophy), though he does not try to decide between them.  Instead, his prediction is social:  eventually machines will be accepted as real people -- just as real people will physically merge with technology -- even if that sounds bizarre to us now.  This theme comes up again and again, and it proves to be one of the only thought-provoking issues of the book.  Chapters 4 and 5 talk about the field of artificial intelligence, where it has been, and where it needs to go.  In a section entitled "The Formula for Intelligence", Kurzweil provides his recipe for the strong AI of the future:  recursion, neural nets, and genetic algorithms -- all taking hints from the reverse engineering of the human brain.  This wishful thinking is one of the Achilles' heels of this book.  For a software entrepreneuer, Kurzweil is strangely blind to the evidence:  software is hardly becoming more complex or "intelligent" at all, let alone exponentially.  Today's software systems are perhaps bigger but not significantly "smarter" than systems of past decades, and software quality continues to barely meet the lowest of expectations.  Despite Moore's Law and the faith that it will continue to provide more and more cycles in the hardware world, progress in the world of software seems, to this software engineer of 15 years, to be nearly a flat line, not an exponential curve.  Just compare how many hundreds of man-years have gone into the lastest version of Windows, versus what it would take to design and implement Kurzweil's ideal of software that is able to write more powerful software.  Part of the problem may be that Kurzweil simply ignores the fields of cognitive psychology and epistemology, which are in their infancy.  He does not seem to even be aware of the issues in these fields which would have to be solved (probably by geniuses) in order to create "strong AI."  Instead, the solutions he predicts are purely materialistic:  brain deciphering, massively parallel hardware, and genetic algorithms.  Part 2 of the book focuses on potential technologies.  The most powerful computers he speculates about are quantum computers, and he doesn't waste any time before asserting that someday we will be able to download the entirety of a brain into a quantum computer, so that the computer will in effect have a clone of that person's mind.  Kurzweil, in his materialism, does not seem to even be aware that there is a philosophical argument that this is impossible.  He also speculates about nanotechnologies and how they will eventually give us a unprecented ability to manipulate physical reality.  Part 3 of the book is comprised of specific predictions for 2009, 2019, 2029, and 2099.  This book was written in 1999, and we can already see that some of his 2009 predictions are either just simple extensions of things we were starting to see in 1999, while others wildly miss the mark, such as:  "the majority of reading is done on displays", "the majority of text is created using continuous speech recognition", and "intelligent roads are in use, primarily for long-distance travel."  That Kurzweil could be so far off in his 10 year predictions does not bode well for his 20-, 30-, and 100-year predictions.  Indeed, his predictions for 2019 sound like a science fiction novel, and of the ones that sound plausible I think he must be off by at least 30 years.  His speculations for 2029 are just fantastic.  In general he seems to "predict" based on the assumption that new technologies will be deployed as soon as they are available, underestimating a myriad of resisting factors:  legal, political, social, market, scientific, etc.  Ultimately this book can be fun for skimming and raises a couple of thought-provoking issues, but as speculating about technology more than 10 years in the future is necessarily a foolish activity, there's plenty of foolishness to be found in here+books
NO+N+sorry, i just thought the book was boring and worst of all, its a good story with alot of food for thought, but it was just written so poorly that it was ruined+books
not worth the money+N+A mediocre, intellectually lazy piece of work that will be of moderate value to beginners. Its basic points are valuable to those who have not been exposed to this structure, but it sorely lacks depth, committment to its subject, or the information value to hold the interest of a reader of above average mental capacity. +books
Drinking or fishing?+N+I have enjoyed reading other books by Mr. Prosek, however, this one was a true disappointment.  I couldn't figure out if this was a book about fishing or drinking.  There seemed to be more anecdotes regarding drinking and getting soused than any fishing action.  Even if the author loves to drink, the book is supposed to be about fishing the 41st parallel and all that that should entail.  I may not have learned much about trout fishing, but I sure know where to find booze joints along the 41st parallel+books
This book will never see the bookself!+P+This book is so great it will never see the bookshelf.  As a first time mom, with my mom across the US, this book came in handy a lot.  I started to read this before my baby was born, and learned stuff I never even knew.  Afterwards it came handy as a refrence, especially when my baby got sick(which was a lot).  This book is great for any first time mom as a shower gift+books
Worth reading+P+What can one say about this book that hasn't been said before?  "Speaker for the Dead" is fundamentally different from "Ender's Game."  Those expecting epic space battles and wild technology will instead be confronted with science fiction in which the primary science is anthropology, which is a welcome change of pace.  "Speaker for the Dead" is by turns gripping, moving, frustrating, interesting, preachy and grossly manipulative.  It's not perfect, but what is?    Wise readers will stop the Ender series at the end of "Speaker for the Dead" and pretend that "Xenocide" doesn't exist.  Don't say I didn't warn you+books
Wow I can hardly wait for the movie!!!+N+This is a great read that will have you lol and thinking at the same time. The writer is talented and gifted and can turn a phrase as fast as you want to turn the page. Perspective, compassion and curiosity are operative words in this outstanding work. I can only imagine one of the Wilson brothers playing the writer in the flick. Don't let the title scare you off as once you get into it you will have made a deposit that will reap you interest+books
Absurdity+N+I'm not a big fan of existentialism to start out with, but I began this play expecting at least to find an interesting theme or philosophy concerning the nature of life and existence.  This work, however, is pure tripe.  Critical appraisal should not even be attempted for this drivel- it's akin to the random scribblings of a two-year old or a mud-splattered canvas.  The drawing on the front cover has more artistic value than this play.  In my mind, it doesn't merit serious consideration and analysis, because it is by nature pure absurdity and nonsense.  Beckett sure accomplished his goal though- look how many reviewers commented on the "extremely difficult themes" and "brilliant artistry" of the play+books
Terrible, Terrible, Terrible!!!+N+This book is terrible, awful, and immoral and if you love Danielle Steel books (don't bother to read this one).  My fiancee and I love to read to each other and I got angry/mad after reading this book.  I just don't believe that marriage is based on cheating.  I think Danielle Steel may have had one to many drinks while writing this book+books
Great Read+P+You can read the other reviews to see what the book is about. Fascinating stuff if you have any interest in psychedelics whatsoever.  The long and short of it is that this book is a great read for being written by a doctor and medical researcher. I found it highly enjoyable. The story is as interesting as the research, and Dr. Strassman's sincere account of the project's difficulties and the personal toll it took on him made the book even more of a page-turner for me.  Note that a small fraction of reviewers here did not like it. What's not to like? The book has: A brief history of psychedelics A look into governmental drug-control bureaucracy Fascinating stories of weird trips including contact with alien beings The occasional rogue test subject Pissed off Buhddists An unstable intern Hilarious slogans like: "You don't come back from .04 an atheist" And other fun stuff  Highly recommended reading.     +books
Worthy Is The Lamb+P+Very good commentary on Revelation, from the viewpoint of everything but the Final Judgment occurred in the first century A.D+books
Entertaining and informative look at crossword construction+P+In an age when the advent of computer-generated sudoku seem to be taking over, Matt Gaffney responds with this very eloquent and entertaining exploration of standard crosswords and how they are created.  Gaffney, an experienced puzzle constructor and editor, offers glimpses into the history of crosswords and their attributes, but the real strength of his book is its insight into the effort that constructors go in making gems for puzzlers.   He discusses the way that puzzle themes have evolved over time, the limits of themed and non-themed puzzles, challenges that constructors have posed themselves, and how new-wave constructors have pushed the boundaries of puzzles using technology to help them fill grids and using their twisted brains to find ever-more-intriguing clues.  This book is well written in a conversational style filled with humorous anecdotes and includes interviews with many editors and constructors.  Of most interest to me was a chapter in which four constructors are given partially completed grids and are asked to use their brains or computer assistance to generate "fills" that they think are best. The results are beautifully divergent, and the way that judges viewed them and rated them points out that the nature of "beauty" in crosswords is still a contested area.  Like Amende's "Crossword Obsession" and Romano's "Crossworld" this book focuses on a very small field, but the thoroughness and humor that suffuse it make it a strong addition.  This book will offer you insights into puzzles if you are a novice and will generate laughs of recognition and empathy if you are an expert or constructor. I recommend it.  Will J+books
A great program!!+P+I know DR. Young and Shelley personally. They went to school with my dad and are great people. I have been to their home and retreat center Rancho Del Sol, and it is a great place. I also have been on the Ph Miracle diet for about 6 months now, and it works! I have lost over 20 pounds since then and I have cleared up some nasty protein pools in my blood that Rob found six months ago when I started the program. At first I was a bit skeptical and hesitant to go on the program, but after time I felt that it was working and it was great. The food - which is cooked by a good friend of my family's and is also on the Ph program - is excellent, and the program is great. And, those jerks that attack Rob and Shelley personally are nothing but low-life jerks. Rob and Shelley are wonderful people and great friends of mine. On their retreat to Rancho Del Sol, they went so far out of their way to help me and all of the others on the retreat. And, when you watch Rob do a live blood test, it is fascinating. He presents his findings in conferences that are followed by a great Alkaline lunch. And the findings are very interesting. He bases most of his work on the work of A. Bechamp, an 18th century scientist that was an understudy of Louis Pasture. The facts are there, and quiet fascinating. He (Rob) is brilliant, but a bit excentric. But that is understandable considering his passion for his work. Over all, this program works. I love the alternative path way to health, but do admit that Western methods are needed at times. I just feel that you don't need to "Dope up" on Px drugs at the first sigh of trouble. So I give this 5 stars not just for the program, but for Rob and Shelley as my good friends.  But... Do this in moderation to other healthy lifestyles. Don't just go 100 percent Alkaline all of the sudden. Slowly work your way to that wanted PH and be moderate with other health practices. So 5 stars for me. The book presents it all. A great read on the Ph program for weight loss! But do not assume something until you have read the book. And forget what you might think about the program until you read the book and have a sound understanding of Rob's theory. Thank you Rob and Shelley!!+books
Smart, fun, and pleasingly cynical+P+I'm at home on bed rest and desperate for something good to read.  This book did the trick..  The narrator is smart, funny, and clearly aware that it is next to impossible to do much about most of the evil sleaziness of the world.  Certainly it is impossible to make changes in individual lives, one at a time.  (Or maybe I'm just jaded, too.  Some may call it maturity.)  Clearly, the narrator is the most decent character in a novel full of morally bankrupt people (from both sides of the tracks).  Ironically, his career is blindsided due to what others perceive to be questionable morals.   Anyway, join Max as he watches pathetic people with and without class, power, and agency screw up their lives even more than they already have, and help him make sense of it.  Great literature this ain't, but a smart, fun, cynical read it is+books
How Bush Became the WORST LEADER EVER!!!!+N+Between sending our country to war over false pretenses (ie; Bush's personal greed), terrible response to Hurricane Katrina, this whole anti-gay thing, and the failure that was No Child Left Behind, I'd have to say that Bush is not a very good leader. That and the guy can't seem to acknowledge  BTW, I myself am not gay but see nothing wrong with it. If you can see it in no other way, the gays might strike back, the way the blacks reacted to whites (and believe me, they had a good reason to) when they were being treated like crap in the '60's. So unless you want riots through your city, you'll at least try to be tolerant. This goes out to all you anti-gay people. And remember; Don't hate people without logical reason! (See, I have good reasons to hate Bush!+books
Covers six centuries and twenty countries+P+Born In Blood And Fire is a superbly presented and concise history of Latin America which covers six centuries and twenty countries, linking accounts of individuals, economics, politics and social structure in a uniform, logical progression of events which will delight both general readers and students seeking an introduction to the region's history. Chapters provide many insights on Latin issues in the process of revealing the history of different nations. Born In Blood And Fire is an invaluable introduction and survey for students of Latin American history+books
Hour Game is one of the worst books I've ever read+N+This is the first (and last) book by David Baldacci that I've ever read. He is one of the worst best-selling writers I've ever read. He writes almost every sentence of dialog in the form of a Tom Swifty sentence ("We've got to get out of here," said King, menacingly). His flair for melodramatic overstatement is second to none. The actions of the characters make no sense at all. For example, when Michelle sees a laser from a gun sight pointed at the chest of her trusty sidekick, Sean King, she says, "Sean, don't move!" instead of "Sean, dive for cover!!!" Bottom line - save your money and buy something worthwhile+books
A Timeless Work of Art+P+The story is sweet, set in an earlier time but does not come across dated. There is an opportunity for math lessons (Sal keeps eating her berries = subtraction; tremendous mouthful = size/proportion) here. Beyond that, kids just love this story. I don't know if it is that there is one main character, a child, and another prominent character, a bear, or what, but I have given this as a gift and it is always a favorite+books
What was I thinking..??  UGH!!!+N+First time I looked through this book, was curiosity of my local library.  Checked out, and was blown away with how cool this book is.  That was 9 months ago.    Being a big U2 fan-and since the price had dropped considerably-decided to buy the book.  After a few minutes of 'reading' it, realized how crappy the pictures in the book are.  Seemes like 90-99% of the pictures are washed out, grainy, and horribly reproduced here.  Was there any quality control as this book went to press?  And for those 'new, never before seen pictures' they are pretty ho hum.  Because its not totally horrid, I'd give it 2.5 stars.  Just, well,  disappointing.  If I had to pay the full MSRP, I'd give it ZERO stars.  While I must say, for $14 or so, you do get some good training on how heavy your next laptop will be...+books
Excellent Resource - for Traditional Weddings+P+This book has been a very good resource for our wedding.  However, I have found it lacking in a few areas.  It does not have any information on destination weddings.  I was also a little disappointed to not find a section on how to tastefully handle a departed parent.    Overall, this is the best book I have found on the topic of wedding ettiquette and it meshes nicely with Emily Post's Etiquette. +books
Buckle Your Seatbelt+P+Wanted:  A reader for Flann O'Brien's AT SWIM-TWO-BIRDS.   1) Requisites: Forgiveness of the not-very-linear, willingness to suspend disbelief and attachment to conventions, flexibility to take hairpin turns and seeming leaps of logic without a moment's notice, and tolerance of sloth, drink and the occasional effluvia.  2) Experience and education: familiarity with James Joyce, Samuel Beckett and Irish literary culture of the early 20th century helpful.  Competitive emphasis awarded applicants with a working definition of "metafiction." 3) Job description: Sort out nested narratives of authors and their characters; identify author's concepts regarding the creative process; laugh at author's lampoons, ironies and jokes; develop a high appreciation of author's conceptuality and use of voice; locate surprising floes of prose through which echo all kinds of intelligence; don't worry about getting absolutely every reference; appreciate William Gass's critical introduction to this edition, which adds to the fun and vision, and spoils nothing. 4) Compensation and benefits: Never boring, earns reader the metafictional and modern Irish literature badge of experience without much bloodletting.   5) Work location:  Ideally read in proximity to others with whom insights and jokes can be shared but post-college isolation doable; bed not recommended unless weird dreams desired; does not go overly well with sand, gooey sunscreen and the sounds of the top 40 blasting from the radio three beach blankets away. The local pub would quite suit the content.+books
OK+N+This is a complex and detailed history chiefly of Cuban exiles in South Florida and the influence they have been able to wield regionally and internationally with and without the help of various U.S. administrations. In that sense, it is the story of two cities - Miami and Washington - and two peoples - Americans and Cubans.    I have an objection, though, with the stone-hard style in which this volume is so meticulously, even gorgeously at times, written. Didion strives to be so achingly academic that there is little real heart to this book and, worse, the result is a cold, humorless, colorless story that is at times an unappealing example of ideological abstractions and alphabet soup.   The author, in her conspicuously clean and parenthetical prose, apparently is so charged by the subject of her research that she has forgotten there are people on the other end - readers. It is, in that sense, a boring little disaster of a book. +books
Very disappointing.+N+I saw the Bill Moyer's PBS series on Huston Smith.  I was very impressed.  I bought The World's Religions by Huston Smith and was blown away.  Fantastic summaries of the 7 great world religions and a chapter on the lesser religions.  I've had the question nagging at the back of my mind for a while, "Does religion really matter?"  So, when coming across Why Religion Matters I knew I had to read it.  I didn't read the whole book.  I fell just short of 200 pages before giving up.  The book wasn't getting to the point.  It just kept bashing science and Scientism, over and over.  This is a dreadful book+books
A thorough coverage of this genre+P+'Lowbrow art' blends pop culture, street culture, pop art and surrealism with a strong focus on controversial sub-cultures from bikers to 60s sitcoms. It's about time that a thorough coverage of this genre is presented, and Painter and journalist Matt Dukes Jordan provides a spirited assessment of the high points of lowbrow in Weirdo Deluxe: The Wild World Of Pop Surrealism & Lowbrow Art. Full-page color reproductions of such art, from labels to paintings, present both art displays and commentary on the artists creating them.+books
A gem of a stone+P+Lincoln Rhyme, detective extraordinaire and forensics expert, is hot on the trail of a chinese human smuggler/terrorist nicknamed The Ghost. A couple of the illegal immigrants being shipped to the US have escaped, are in hiding, and are being hunted down by The Ghost. The combined forces of the NYPD, FBI, as well as the INS must stop him before all of immigrants are taken out. Jeffery Deaver excels here and one can almost perceive the inspiration of Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes. Sonny Li, an undercover cop from China, is the most outstanding character in the book. Since most detective thrillers are generic, it's good to come across splendid work like this. Lincoln Rhyme fans obviously will enjoy The Stone Monkey, but initiates will also be thrilled by it+books
Not a handbook for parents+N+This is a very comprehensive book about the general subject of raising bilingual children, based on a number of case studies. I am sure that therefore it would be of great use to anyone studying a linguistic subject in this realm.   However as a handbook for parents who want to raise a bilingual child it hardly offers any advise. I have a different native tongue than my wife, who's native language is English. Living in an English speaking country I would like my daughter to learn my (foreign) native language too. What I was looking for is a book with tips and ideas, such as word games, books, etc. to bring a second language playfully and naturally into a toddler's life.   If you are looking for such a book too, this is not the one. Although the book may be good for a linguistics student I have to give it a low rating because of its misleading title+books
Worst book I have read in a long time!+N+I have never read a Danielle Steel novel, but my friend bought it when we were inter-railing through Europe last week so I picked it up out of sheer boredom.   The grammar is atrocious, and the repetitiveness highly irritating. How many times do Sasha and what's his name need to break up and get back together? How often does Sasha need to cry about this artsy guy?   This book was so annoying that I had to literally put it down and stop reading it.  I will never pick up another Danielle Steel book, and I am still appalled that the publishing world even let this one be published!+books
Superb book for explaining online option trading+P+The book is clearly written and it solved many of the mysteries I had concerning trading options.  An excellent feature of the book is that it gives the addresses of many online sources for stock or option information+books
To Much Detail; +N+Temperance Brennan is an American forensic anthropologist .The author is a anthropologist in real life and I feel she gave to much detail as to body parts & conditions ,& locations in the book , and in about the 3rd chapter to much time and space is wasted talking about "Gabby " including in detail where gabby lives and details that surround the outside of Gabbys place & How Gabby and Tempe were friends from GRad to man parts in life . Book was not for me I dropped it at the 3rd chapter .+books
This Book is a Hit!+P+I am returning to the market after several years in the motion picture industry and was looking for a refresher on the business end of photography.  Vik Orenstein has provided a wonderful primer for both beginner and professional alike, and I unreservedly recommend this book to anyone who is serious about pursuing a career in photography.  She thoroughly covers necesary subjects such as choosing CPAs and lawyers, networking, and the various photographic markets available for pursuit. She does all of this in a winsome way, relating both her successes and failures as she developed and grew her own studios.  If you are considering entering the field of photography as a professional, seriously consider purchasing this book. You will be making a very wise investment+books
The Colorado Kid, The King Flops+N+I was terribly disappointed with this King release.  Could a creative writing student done better?  Perhaps.   It was by far the worst published work I've ever read.  It was unreadable.  Throughout the entire first chapter I waited for a plot to be formed.  The characters were choppy and the story went nowhere.  The book seemed to be published on his name alone.  I have been disappointed in S. King  for some time now and this book really cemented my idea that he has lost his touch.  I am a long time fan, I began reading him in 8th grade and the last good book I read, written by him, was Hearts In Atlantis. +books
Lame detective+N+The premise of the story caught my attention -- a man presumed dead for years, whose wife had already collected a large insurance policy on him, appears to be alive after all.  The problem is that Sue Grafton's fictional detective Kinsey Millhone is too incompetent to solve the case.  How does she resolve her dilemma?  By asking two other perpetrators if they were involved just to satisfy Ms. Milhone's curiosity.  Lame!   And then there is this subplot into Ms. Millhone's personal life that leads to nowhere.  I don't know what "K" or the rest of the alphabet has in store for readers, but I'm not interested in finding out+books
Very good book for security policy enablers and admins+P+This is one of the few books that I have come across that focuses mainly on the innards of security assessments. The services based security and counter measures are helpful for threat modeling. This book is really great for people in the security risk and threat analysis for a quantitative and qualitative validation. Good book to help in setting up corporate security policy model.   Other people have already provided a good chapter wise run-down so I will skip that here...  Buy this book :)+books
Nice Picture Book+P+Basically Diamond Baratta Design is a lovely picture book - If you are a decorator or decorating your own home it can be a good source of inspiration or at least a few ideas .If just a fan of decorators it might disappoint as there is little substantive background information about their careers and philosophy. A good mate to this volume would be a book about Dorothy Draper as the Diamond Baretta team follow through on many of her ideas about color and scale. +books
This will BORE you to death! +N+Im a regular reader of Forbes Magazine, and theres nothing i love more then reading about inspirational stories of entrepreneurs, businessmen, tycoons etc so i picked up this book thinking its by "Forbes" so it must have some great stories. I also rely on Amazon.com reviews for my purchases, so everything i say is from the bottom of my heart...  But im sorry you would not believe how BORING this Book actually turned out to be. The writing style of Daniel Gross, is well "Grossly Boring", Unispirational, unmoving and generally a waste of your money and time.   As far as im concerned:  This Book will NOT inspire you, It will not motivate you, it wont even make you appreciate the Great accomplishments of the very people it writes about.   It is a diservice to the personalities it talks about, and is a diservice to Forbes. Very disapointed, im just hoping to flog it for whatever i can get.   Finally i would advise anyone who is genuinely interested in the personalities this Book writes about to do a GOOGLE search and read about them from there, because you will probably learn and appreciate more that way.+books
No Temperance Here+N+Ms. Reichs has lost the recipe, or at least the focus and formula that has brought her success prior to Cross Bones. Although not nearly as bad as P. Cornwell's last two or three misfires, Reichs is way wide of her usual high mark here. In this offering, Temperance is out of character, out of both style and focus, and the story is just overly convoluted and circuitous; a yarn that meanders around heading every which way except toward a finished product. Even the writing is unfamiliar and not of the same voice Reichs has maintained in her many Brennan novels. Having finally given up on Cornwell, after many years, I'll hang in there for one more Temperance Brennan dig; everyone is entitled to one gong+books
Just very odd......+N+This story should have and COULD HAVE been really good. It presents a great concept, but the story is just so poorly crafted. It is VERY sexist, the prose is stiff, and the plot is dull. I will concede that it was interesting at times; it kept me reading, but I really didn't get much out of it. I can only praise Heinlein for including the "intelligent conversation" which takes place after the press conference, where there is a great explantion on why the English language is so difficult to learn. The whole story is just very odd. Do read it though. It's a title to read if you wish to be considered "well read." Despite its faults, Valentine Michael Smith will be a character in literature that will never be forgotten, just as we will never forget Atticus from "To Kill A Mockingbird."+books
The worst of Catherine Coulter+N+I am a big Catherine Coulter fan, but this book is awful.  You can skip all the Soap scenes, a waste of space.  Much of the dialouge made no sense and the characters were very flat.  Don't waste the $6, borrow from the library if you want to read+books

Before you swallow the hype read all of the reviews!+N+I totally agree with the couple of reviews where the book was sent back to Amazon. Some of the reviews are positively glowing and just why is beyond my comprehension, The book offers (as do most watercolor instruction books)considerable  sound advice about supplies and composition etc etc etc but the pictures SUCK! It is difficult for me to believe this is a professional artist (presuming  making a living on this humdrum output.) She has a vey limited palette mostly autumnal browns and golds and mostly very small (8x8 and 12x12) pictures that are a hash and rehash of weeds leaves and branches,,sometimes a watercolor book is so astoundingly beautiful it is worth having just to admire the pics,,,well,,,not this one! Totally ripped off is the feeling given,+books
unsatisfying on multiple levels+N+Most of the people looking at this book most likely already have an interest in women's studies, feminism, and the like.  If that's you, you're going to be disappointed.  You could already guess the author's point and what she's going to say, and she offers it all up without any interesting insights.  If you're just interested in stripping, you'll also be disappointed, because there's nothing particularly compelling about her story or the "back stage" scenes she offers.  If you're familiar with Eaves's reporting, from Slate magazine and such, you'll already be familiar with her style -- superficial analysis and lack of compelling argument or detail.  Skip this book -- there are better feminist analyses of stripping out there, and there are much more interesting stripper "tell-all" autobiographies as well. +books
Disappointing+N+A thoroughly self-indulgent narrator abandons her family on a whim and ventures out (on her husband's dime?) to "discover herself" and experience the kinds of things her priviledged, sheltered life never offered her. The novel is nicely crafted, but the character is shallow and cloying--sadly, I think we're supposed to support her. I kept hoping she'd return home to an empty house.+books
More spin to add to the spin - where does it end?+N+I was disappointed by this book. It does not help me to understand the 'truth' about global warming. Patrick Michael's subjective ranting throughout the book can be labelled 'humour', and 'readability', but I have to say that, for me, the rhetorical devices just put me off. It's just sensationalising the subject.  I can understand that he may feel he has a point here, and he may have one, I don't know (still), but, as a scientist, I find it impossible to take what he says seriously when it is just littered with remarks that would be better placed in a tabloid newspaper.  He makes some good points about the links between science, media and funding - how organisations will link issues to the cute and furry animals and so on in order to get more support. But these have been made many years ago, and aren't news to me as a social scientist. Ditto for the difficulties for attributing causality (p.128).  What I find, as with Lomborg's book, is that these authors are so busy building a rebuttal to an argument that they themselves produce 'evidence' that is just as biased, if not more so, the other way, and this reduces their credibility to anyone who is not already convinced that they are right. Relying on the rhetoric of powerful soundbites to get those who agree with him is not going to convince those of us who are really trying to learn here.  +books
Massive, Barely Edited Compendium of Sometimes Tantalizing Stories+N+Dr. Steven Greer is a well-known figure on the fringe of UFOlogy, and he claims to have "briefed" senior government figures on the UFO issue, but five minutes with this book reveals why few take the issue seriously.  It's an amateurish, sometimes incoherent clip job of unedited, free-flowing interviews with dozens of scientists, pilots and former government/military figures, most of whom say they experienced a highly strange UFO episode (though some of the "testimony" is second-hand).   The firsthand stories can be very interesting and provocative, especially when they purport to cover the government's secrecy, suppression and disinformation techniques. But any impact the content might have is pretty much overshadowed by the hard fact that "Disclosure" is a disorganized, misspelled, contradictory, somrtimes unintelligible, incoherent mess. It's not even "written" in the strict sense -- it appears to be a bunch of interview transcripts hurriedly set in type, not subjected to so much as a simple spell-checker. Names and geographic locations are mangled, punctuation is absent, and the speakers' weird allusions are left hanging. It's hundreds of pages long, but it feels like the world's biggest high school social studies project.   The one consistent stylistic point is that Dr. Greer's name or initials appear over and over and over again -- nobody ever accused him of missing self-promotion opportunities -- but the amateurish nature of the production is a net negative mark against him. It's a mess.  In a foreword Greer says the material was/is so urgent, because it deals with the future of the entire human race, etc., that it had to be rushed into publication. I would like to think the definitive word on the future of the entire human race will be spelled right and look like it came from grown-ups.  Tragically disorganized efforts like "Disclosure" warm the hearts of the disinformation masters, I'm sure, because the UFO movement hangs itself with this kind of stuff -- or at least consigns itself to eternal fringe status. It's a serious subject and it deserves serious coverage, but "Disclosure," for all the nuggets of interest it contains, helps guarantee that the subject won't be taken seriously for the foreseeable future.  +books
Unbelievable+N+Don't waste your money! The author allegorizes the text to say that Genesis (at least the so called "prehistory") is no more than ancient mythology. Its amazing to me a Christian scholar can claim that the bible is anything other than the LITERAL word of God. If you take the scripture seriously, don't waste your time or money+books
Great Purchase+P+There was no marks in the whole book, and the price was great+books
Only for first year, if u are doing indepth o-chem then this isnt it+N+Mcmurry is a colourful and over-generalized textbook that presents the most fundamental concepts of organic chemistry without fully elucidating on their logic. Mcmurry's style is to induce learning of 0-chem via memorizing of reaction mechanisms, and other trivial components.  The only reason you should buy this book (same reason I did) is if your o-chem course is based on this; that being, this is your prescribed text. It is far too difficult to study organic chemistry with another textbook. However this may not be the case for this edition of Mcmurry. Organic Chemistry by Wade has the same chapter format, covers essentially the same thing but treats  the fundamental principles with more depth; allowing the reader to appreciate the finer points of organic chemistry.  One thing that irritated me the most about this book was that there is no appendix for IR frequencies of major functional groups, and mass spectra is barely covered. It is at best just mentioned...nothing more. Wade treats the interpretation of spectral data with more clarity and depth...something which is essential in second year chemistry.  All in all this book doesnt even provide a good grounding in the basics. When it discuses KMnO4 oxidatation, that at least should be a review of redox.   The chapters on Substitution and elimination reactions as well as further chapters in aromatic chemistry are satisfactory, but it is the basics that are lacking. I would suggest for first time o-chem students to consult Wade and compare it to the writing style of Mcmurry. Albeit Mcmurry is very nice and colourful, you will regret its lack of depth and its over simplification of organic chemistry.  The book itself is supplemented with another spectroscopy book here in Australia, which suggests the severe lackings of this book. This has been inherent in it for the last three editions...Not too happy with it+books
A Not-So-Practical Guide to New Urbanism+N+The suburban landscape of the United States is the subject of this book, advertised as "the first practical guide to creating communities that truly are communities-not merely enclaves near off-ramps." Guided by the principles of the Congress for the New Urbanism (CNU), the book uses excerpts from that organization's Charter to illuminate its advocacy of more connected development patterns. The book's scope extends beyond the commercial strip to include the major building blocks of towns and suburbs, such as apartment complexes, schools, parks and office campuses.  Hall and Porterfield includes passages of fist-thumping suburbia-bashing similar to James Howard Kunstler's Home From Nowhere (1998, Touchstone Books) or Jane Holtz Kay's Asphalt Nation (1997, Crown). They also include graphic material, much of it adapted their earlier book, A Concise Guide to Community Planning (1994, McGraw-Hill).   Readers knowledgeable about New Urbanism will find few surprises here, other than a few glaring factual errors, like a reference to "Tyson's Corners, Virginia, one of the largest metropolitan areas in the United States" (p. 7) and a claim that Edge Cities and urban villages are "two names for essentially the same thing" (p. 210). Good points crop up here and there, but recommendations are so limited in scope that it can be difficult to discern whether the sample site designs are intended to be good or bad examples, which limits the book's usefulness pedagogically. The lack of dimensions on most of the drawings also severely limits the book's utility as a practical reference. Hall and Porterfield contrast "conventional suburban development" and "Traditional Neighborhood Development" options for site plans, but the comparisons sometimes seem forced and nearly always ignore the larger regional issues so critical to the debate.   One ideal audience for this book might suburban planning commissioners, who need guidance from designers in order to understand the differences between conventional suburban development pods and walkable, human-scaled neighborhoods.+books

Mountain Of Life+P+Da Chen's rendition of memories etched within his heart is very descriptive. I especially like this passage:   "...The thoughts tortured me and I squirmed in shame and humiliation, but I had to face reality. The teacher could throw me out with a sneer on his face. That was fine, I had thick skin. A poor child couldn't afford to have thin skin. Only rich boys and well-to-do girls with cute little butterflies in their hair could afford to have thin skin"  For a child of nine, to have such vivid memory of a childhood, is  startling. The innocence and words crafted makes Colors of the Mountain, a reading worth investing time in. Reading between the words give you an insight to how deep Da Chen's spiritual values are.  An amazing, funny and innocent book+books
Men sharing +P+It is good that men should dwell together.  Men should share their experiences with eachother+books
Weak Link in a Great Series+N+I read A is for Alphabet years ago and did not get pulled into the series.  Years later I read S is for Silence and was hooked. I started to read the series--backwards at first and then jumped to the beginning.  I have really enjoyed the books and felt a connection to the heroine (and forgiven Ms. Grafton for making her weigh 118 lbs on her 5'6" frame).  However, I agree with the other readers who feel like this is not Grafton at her best.  You just can't believe that Kinsey would put herself in these ridiculous positions---belting a police officer to endear herself to a woman she is investigating, remaining in an incredibly (and unbelievable) dangerous situation, to name a few.  The dialogue is weak,the sexual situations seem gratutitous, and there is a fair amount of stereotyping of hispanics.  But even with these issues, I did finish the book.  Grafton at her low point is still a good read+books
Great Book+P+Seriously, I had to write this review because of all the people who gave it such a low rating. ARE YOU KIDDING ME. Ok there may be a few things wrong with the book. I wouldn't mind a few pictures here and there. However, to say that the whole book is terrible is a bit extreme. I have a bunch of cookbooks and this is the one I continually go back to to compare recipes. I sold baked good at a farmers market and his Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookies got rave reviews. He also gives so many options on a way to change a recipe. Like his cheescake. He gives you a way to light it up or make a dense one. He troublshoots each recipe in case something did go wrong. Very good book+books
A disappointment+N+Reading the title and description of this book, I was excited about reading it. I found the writing not up to the task! Despite having a great deal of interest in the subject, after scanning the book I decided not to read it+books
Insightful and Hilarious+P+This is a unique and hilarious book on 23 models that the author, Adrian Slywortzky, presents for improving the profitability of a company. The author methodically presents an insightful story in each chapter enabling the reader to gain an appreciation of the 23 models through parables and hilarious stories.  The author did a good job of transforming a rather dry subject into something interesting which both the veteran in accounting and the novice will find enjoyable and enlightening. The reader is made to reflect and think about their business which makes the book unique and useful.  As soon as I got the book, I swallowed it in three days and I have to admit that it was extremely tasty and satisfying. This is a useful book for all people running businesses and those intending to do so. +books
its over guys +N+This is a kids book. First few had my attention but since then its getting worse with each book.+books
Brilliantly written.+P+Having lived in the author's home for two years while in New York I am biased towards this niche masterpiece.  Although my interests are on opposite sides of the map in relation to this book I had the privilege to witness, first hand, the author's diligence and perseverence in putting the finishing touches on his textual opus.    In this book Mr. Gauch brings his statistical mastery with him in his endeavor to reconcile science, philosophy and religion in the public arena.  In so doing he greatly enables scientists to become better at what they do by examining the foundations of the scientific method.  This book is a must read for students of science and scientific professionals alike+books
Accusative+N+There really was good bits to this book.  Unfortunately, her accusation against Bible translators as being male and therefore biased against passages that dealt with women seemed terribly harsh if not arrogant.  The basic line of reason goes as follows: "All Bible translators are bigots and have gotten this passage wrong. 'Authority' in the this Biblical passage really doesn't mean 'authority'in the greek."  What does it mean?  Hubcap+books
Well Done Book, yet...+P+I enjoyed Robert Webber's book and have enjoyed hearing him speak as well. At a recent speaking engagement he echoed my own concern over the "fate" of the church in America. So much "commodification" has happened in the church that one wonders if anyone knows what it truly means to be "ecclesia"? Although I agree with much of what he says and am part of a liturgical church (The Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod which utilizes the church calendar and has had a strong emphasis on liturgy - - - the church body which Webber received his doctorate from), my question is are we truly called to "change" the church in order to meet the people where they are at?  I agree with his assessments yet I question the reasonings behind doing it. Do we begin to emphasize certain things to the demise of others, just because the culture would be more "prone" to come to the church? Or does the church remain faithful to its calling despite the changing tides of culture?  Our self-centered culture always asks the question "What does this mean for me?", and this has been a active question in the church for sometime. I believe the question that we should be asking is how does God give meaning to me, or what do I mean to God? Our focus needs to be off of ourselves and onto the Lord of the cosmos+books
Poor excuse for a thriller+N+Rising Sun was a terrible read.  Crichton uses one device throughout:  the old hand knows everything an hour before the young guy and slowly reveals it to him.  It's tiring and monotonous.  Never mind the even more monotonous lectures on the differences between American and Japanese business cultures.+books
More colonel and less general+N+I have read many books on WWII from many perspectives and have been to visit the D-Day beaches four times. I cannot visit the American graves in Normandy without being moved. Twice I have had the experience of hearing taps played near Omaha Beach. I have the utmost respect for all those who fought and died. I had high expectations for the book. My problem is that the book never finds its voice. At times it is the four star general writing with his perspective of high and at other times it is the young colonel leading his men. I wanted to hear more from this man. Just as he starts to share, the general leaps in and throws off the narrative. Let the colonel talk about his artillery missions and show me more of how his experience was different. (A few photos and maps would be nice). If the general needs to talk, give him a separate chapter at the end of the book. We hear from the privates and generals but not the majors and colonels. Their voices could add to the history. I wish the colonel would have spoken for them+books
Why Do People Love It?+N+This book got great reviews and was recommended to me by someone whose taste I trust, but I've got to say, I just don't understand its appeal.  It starts out as mildly intriguing, and some of the scenes with the unwed mothers in the first section are evocative, but the lovably twinkly and clairvoyant old nun is just too saccharine to bear, and the narrator of the middle section, salt-of-the-earth gardener Son, is not only too good to be true, he's also deathly boring--a dull-witted drone.  I've read Bel Canto and The Patron Saint of Liars only confirms my belief that Ann Patchett's novels are overrated. +books
Try not to get over whelmed by the technicalities...+P+This is a technically meaty book for the medical professional that can overwhelm the layperson. Yet the area of Autism, Asperger's Syndrome and PDD study is in desperate need of the fresh out-of the-box thinking that this book provides. A parent can learn alot skimming over the "why's" and "what fors".  For example; focusing on bold print sub-points instead of trying to follow the fine points of metabolism described in the following paragraphs, will serve you well.  This book will give you a good overview of groundbreaking research and treatment. Most of all, it will give parents hope that our children may still be capable of functioning better, not just coping with limitations.+books
Breathing Extraordinary Truths Into Ordinary Lives+P+I read this novel because it won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction.  Anne Tyler has a gift for portraying ordinary indivdiuals who live ordinary lives.  Yet her novel is anything but ordinary because her characters are simple, yet real and their dialogue rings true.  Moreover, Ms. Tyler, like Hardy and Miller before her, clearly believes and successfully posits that her mundane characters are heroic because they survive, perservere and present (albeit unknowingly) moral and spiritual lessons that are universal to us all. But my hesitation in giving this novel 5 stars is that, while it is great fiction, it is not the greatest fiction of its time. And this raises another issue.  Why have so many Pulitzer Prize novels, such as "Gilead," "The Known World," "Empire Falls," "The Hours," "Kavalier & Clay," and "Middlesex," disappointed me recently? While these are compelling and at times superb works, they are not, in my opinion, deserving of the Pulitzer Prize.  Of recent winners, only "The Shipping News" merits that distinction.  Perhaps I will focus on National Book Award winners, since they seem more uniformly satisfying.+books
Stop Searching.  Begin here+P+I am one of those freaks who would look at a bezillion books before settling with one. (Talking about computer books ofcourse!).   This is especially significant when it comes to XML because there is so much tech jargon out there & it is really hard find a book that does not get lost in the details & instead introduce us to the core right away.  This book does exactly that.  You will start writing decent xml right away.    The following will be helpful.  1.  HTML knowledge (a little) 2. The concept of scripts 3.  The concept of CSS 4. The concept of XML   When I say 'the concept of', I am only talking about a surface level, "Purpose of existence" kind.  Even if you don't know anything about XML, you will be fine with this book.  The book gradually introduces the concepts & does a very neat job of explaining new ideas.   Peace.+books
Just 'ok'+N+I started reading 'The no.1 Ladies Detective Agency' but could never really get into it. I liked the idea of this book however so decided to give the author another go. Sadly, although the book has some funny moments (Bertie's tantrums!)it never really gripped me. I love Scotland but am not familar enough with the places and slang terms so felt i missed out on the 'insider' comments. The book also has a very poor ending which leaves lots of loose ends and you end up thinking 'hold on what happened to..?' and 'what was the point of?'.  On the whole it is ok and i imagine if you are familar with Edinburgh you would enjoy it more than i did+books
Protector has always been entertaining+P+I have always enjoyed the older books by Larry Niven, and recently began collecting them again.  I love the entire integral universe he has created and the stories are excellent.  I would recommend this book for anyone who is looking for a realtively quick sci-fi read for the summer+books
REMEMBER, IT'S A DIARY!!!!+P+Some of the reviews listed criticize this book for it's "opinions," "harsh jugdements," etc. This was written as a private journal, and not to betaken as an indepth, researched, polished project. Just let him speak!+books
The Best World History Atlas Book Anywhere+P+The Oxford Atlas is the best of all competitors. It is full-size, high quality ink and paper, 368 pages and covers most areas of history from the caveman to the present time. I am not speaking of the concise edition but of the full-size edition. The ISBN number is #0195215672.   This book covers about 2,000,000 years of history from the origins of humanity to the year 2000. The Atlas is the result of over three years' work by internationally renowned cartographers, an expert editorial team and specialist academic consultants+books
Not a GOOD detective!+N+Being a long-time Nancy Drew collector, I really looked forward to reading this book, but I found it to be very disappointing. I've read a lot of the 'tart-noir' wacky-gal mystery series, and this book seems to have all the standards - sexy, ditzy gal who just can't seem to get it all together, hunky boyfriend, obsession with glamorous flashy clothes, the need to keep secrets from the police, and on and on. But Cece Caruso just doesn't come off with any realism to me. She's too over-the-top, and she's not even a good detective. By her own admission, over and over throughout the book, she keeps missing the point, and the clues, and everything else that would lead her to understand what's going on and solving the mystery.  Cece is a biographer of mystery writers and in this book she is writing a book about Carolyn Keene, the author of the Nancy Drew books who was and still is a group of ghostwriters. There is a lot of Nancy Drew collecting info in this story that was, for the most, taken from some speculative fan-made guides, honored by some collectors as The Truth but frowned upon as hypothetical by the rest of the bibliographic world. It also seems the author made up some of her own. Her depiction of Nancy Drew collectors at their annual convention in Palm Springs is really unflattering. Believe me, they are not the strange, nerdy, boring people she makes them out to be. For some reason she found it necessary to compare their boring get-together with a wild swinging convention of golf-fan lesbians at the same hotel.  It's disappointing that the first major piece of fiction published about Nancy Drew collecting and Nancy Drew collectors is such a mediocre book that plods along for the most going this way and that in directions that lead nowhere or that Cece just doesn't 'get'. Her obsessions with vintage clothes, gourmet foods, alcoholic beverages, art, and on-again-off-again boyfriend are all pretty interesting, but she and her gang need more characterization, and need to be a little less fabulous-in-every-way to be believable.  Nancy Drew fans who read this book will probably be disappointed. It's less about Nancy and more about Cece and friends and how 'hot' and 'cool' and too-fabulous-to-be-true they are. Let's hope the next author who takes on the Nancy Drew mystique will give it a more interesting treatment+books
Will Be A Collector's Item Some Day+N+I recently saw this book on the bargain bin.  This book was pure garbage, by two arrogant 20-somethings in clown suits.  Basically they are saying valuations don't matter.  Since they wrote the book, it has been prooven that their philosophy, approached over the long term, produces some great damaging losses.  The book may be useful during the next bubble, which if history serves, will occur well after these clowns pass on to the big three-ring circus in the sky.  To the dungeon with these two knaves+books
America's Educator+P+Is Amy Goodman the last honest journalist in America?  Along with maybe 20 others - maybe YEAH !!!  What I admire most about Ms Goodman is her persistence - while there are other hard-working investigative journalists - Seymour Hersh, Robert Fisk, to name a few - no one - but no one - punches in as many hours on the clock as she does.  All of which is evidenced in the book which is a summation of the highlights of her research leading up to the build-up of the war in Iraq and through the war as it stands now.  What is essential in this rendering, however, is that the reasons for our current policy are made explicit - as they are daily on her magnificent show on Radio Free America - Pacifica.  It's nice to see it collected in an easily referenced and indexed hard copy+books
How ironic that this, one of the best in the series, follows what is probably the worst in the series.+P+I've read the Left behind series twice, and, both times, I blazed through 'Armageddon'. In my honest opinion, it was one of the best in the series. Why? Simply due to logical progression.   When one of the main characters make a stupid and fatal mistake, we are taken on a journey with them. When another one of the 'heroes' makea stupid move in judgment, we are taken on the journey with them. When one of the longtime main characters in the series decides to step into the warzone, he is not in the middle of some act of God that will save his life.   Armageddon is simply one of the wildest books in the series and relies on very little, if any, use of deus ex machina to bail out the stupid main characters.   True, the writing is still simple and the characters even simpler, but by this point, you should alreayd know that. The thing about Armageddon that makes it so good is the pace it moves. It's both frenetic and painstaking at the same time. How is this possible? Because we are constantly switching from different points of view. However, each one of them is an ordeal of suffering (especially for the haters of LB that have stupidly stuck with the story for so long... either they have no life, are very, very hopeful, or are too ashamed to admit that they, too, love this story).  Bottom line - things HAPPEN in this book. After the turd that was 'The Remnant', where virutally nothign of note happened, 'Armageddon' puts all the pieces on the board for the final battle in 'Glorious Appearing'.  I should also mention that the title may be a bit misleading. This book simply introduces Armageddon, and the first few battle of the great war; 'Glorious Appearing' is the grand finale where it all happens.  In any case, thumbs way up for 'Armageddon'+books
Description is misleading+N+The Amazon description says Vol. 1-3, boxed set, hardcover.  That is all true.  What they don't tell you is that there are actually six volumes.  The box in which it comes is clearly marked, "Volumes 1-3 (of six)."  That would have been a much better description for Amazon to have used.  If you have volumes 4-6 and you are looking to complete the set, this book is for you.  If you are looking for the complete set, look elsewhere+books
Oriental haute cuisine with no gimmicks, by a master+P+Two weeks ago my girlfriend Snow and I dined at Tetsuya's new restaurant Mju at the Millenium Knightsbridge Hotel in London, prompted by Snow's raving of Tetsuya from her winters in Sydney.  The only dining option is an eight-mini-course tasting menu, but since the man himself was in town (Tetsuya spends only one week a month in London) we were all for it.  We thought the portions were adequate, but I suspect people used to NYC portions might go home hungry.  I must say that his cuisine was awesome - highlighting the flavors of fresh ingredients, and many of the courses were based on raw or undercooked items.  Although the presentation of the food was highly stylised - just look at the photos in the cookbook and they are similarly presented at your table - the cooking is unfussed and the philosophy predominantly reflected the Japanese appreciation for simplicity and French classical culinary techniques.  The result was that every dish managed to emphasize yet enhance the flavor of the main ingredient.  Compared to Nobu, Tetsuya is hardly fusion and very Asian at heart.  Most of the courses served at Mju are included in the cookbook, so we know that these recipes have been tried and tested.  What's most gratifying is the listing at the end of the book of food sources for Mju - London lags NYC in terms of high-end food stores such as Dean &amp; Deluca and Citarella, so the list is very useful, and it allows me to dream about learning to cook at the level of a master like Tetsuya+books
excellent, worthwhile reading all of it+P+It is an amazing journey through our deepest fears and questions about life whether personal or professional.  The first part goes through those questions all of us have or have had combined with real life examples and a second part where the author shares his insight as to what to do with all those questions and answers we start to get by reading the book+books
Choices+P+This is a fascinating, entertaining, short read about a group of travellers who take a bus excursion from hell into a place where they are given a chance to go into heaven. Surprisingly, they actually seem to prefer hell.  This is not a book about what heaven is like or what hell is like.  It's about people like us, and our choices, and how they affect our lives as eternal beings.  Reading the dialogue as heavenly beings try to convince them to come to heaven, I found myself trying to keep track of who was the "right" person and who was "wrong", because the way the hell-people were talking was just the same way I talk! Of course, they seemed so stupid to me because I was on the heaven side of the book. But it reminded me of a quote from the movie The Truman Show (paraphrased): "I think what bothers you is that Truman prefers his cell."   These people lived in hell (and that description is interesting too) and they would rather go back there than swallow the pride that had made them reject God in the first place. One of Lewis' easier reads, for people who find him difficult to follow+books
Disappointing and Overly Optimistic+N+Well, I'd love to read a good book by that title and one might even copy the blurb texts and the table of contets of Woodhouse's book - all its weaknesses are in the fine print, so to say. The paradigm wars the title  refers to are meant to take place between &quot;traditional&quot;  (mechanistic, etc.) science and &quot;new age&quot; (holistic, etc.) world  views, which present levels of complexity not available to the traditional  approaches. No doubt such a war takes place presently... (1) It's an  obvious problem that the &quot;new&quot; paradigm is conceptualized as  being open and unfinished - together with the author's desire to  appropriate all nice and interesting recent scientific developments for his  side, one may at times wonder what the &quot;new paradigm&quot; is and what  limits it necessarily must have. (2) Woodhouse limits is attention more or  less to academic debate - but that's not primarily where the wars are being  fought. (Does he think it really matters? The climate in academic  institutions may depend on quite a number of factors beside rational  arguments...) The bullets fly right in our everyday life situatios - when  we see our physician and argue about a treatment (which may or may not be  paid by health insurance depending on the influence that &quot;traditional  scientists&quot; (aka drug manufacturers and their lackeys) have on the  insurance firm). It also takes place in firms striving for enhanced  effectiveness in the form of the question &quot;will it be possible to make  our employees work harder - or should we consider something new  altogether?&quot;. And it takes many more forms one does not even find  mentioned in this book. (3) On the fronts of these wars I know, the  situation looks rather bleak for new approaches. traditional doctrines are  well entrenched and have lots of powerful allies - economic shorttermism  advocating &quot;tried and true&quot; measures, traditional health  providers, genetic engineering firms, religious institutions producing cult  scares from time to time, etc. If you advocate divergent paradigms, you  need a lot of patience - and you're also faced with some serious problems  Woodhouse does not mention. Let me point here only to the fact that while  publicly recognized &quot;sciences&quot; have something like a memory in  terms of libraries and institutional continuity, &quot;new age  thought&quot; all to often starts all over again, repeats its standard  arguments and, in sum, doesn't get anywhere for lack of such a continuity,  for lack of references one could build on. Altogether, I'm sorry for the  money and for the time I spent on this book. Still, someone should write a  better one... - it's a worthy project, just a faulty implementation+books
Total BULL!!+N+Estrich is far from unbiased and makes an attempt to come off as such. She's in the hip pocket of the Liberals and is exactaly what her book claims Coulter and her fans are. A friend forced me to reed this claiming it would forever change my views. Quite the opposite.  Ann Coulter wrote her book standing up for conservatives and Christians since people like Estrich is out there trying to say the liberal way a good person would think. Everything else is wrong. She now comes out with phony outrage and tries to claim that the conservatives are the ones who have been attacking. Fact is Bill Clinton did do monumentally fould and dangerous things to this country.  When Clinton was in office Estrich defended everything he did. We had 8 terrorist attacks under Clinton and she felt it was appauling to speek so negatively about a seeted president. What a double standard.  Now with this book she shows phoney moral outrage and copies Coulter trying to reverse the flow.   If you can, borrow this book, don't waste your money. reed it if you plan to argue with someone though. It is full of flawed logic and total bull. It will make your arguing easy. Libs hate facts+books
Count me in the minority+N+Unlike most reviewers here, I really disliked this book.  The main reason is that the entire novel is a gimmick without any real substance.  There is no reason to tell such a dull story except for the fact that there is some mysterious story-within-a-story complexity.  The characters, especially the protagonist Iris, are bores.  Iris is like a 300 page wet blanket.  Most of the other characters are 1-dimensional cut outs.  Her sister Laura is the exception, but she got on my nerves too with her one-note quirkiness.  The story-within-a-story is more a gimmick than anything else.  The science-fiction meta-story within that story I thought was the most interesting part of the book, but it goes nowhere and its purpose is even more tenuous than its parent.  Finally, this is my second Atwood book, and I really dislike her writing style.  It reads as if she is trying too hard, and even the simplest situations feel forced.  I don't understand why everyone seems to like this book, but I would just suggest not to believe all the hype.+books
Too long, Too unorganized+N+For all the hype this book has received I am pretty disappointed. I found this book to be written in a very non-engaging style, making it difficult to just follow what the author was saying. Additionally it's absolutely terribly organized.  What kind of programming book spends the first couple of chapters talking about programs that use and implement classes, and then finally halfway through the book actually tells you what a class is and how to make one.  It's absolutely unusable as a reference, and just barely useable as a means of learning C.  C is a very large and complicated programming language, and therefore books on it should do their best to be as helpful and organized as possible.  If programming languages were books, C would be "C Primer", poorly thought out, unorganized, and unnecessarily complicated+books
Broad strokes about student life, not really about the freshman year+N+I expected this book to be about the freshman year experience, based on the title and the way that the book began.  However, the book ended up being more about broad strokes describing student life.  The author did not live in a freshman residence hall and I am unsure if she primarily enrolled in gateway classes or not.  Memorable aspects include her depiction of the student community being comprised of independent networks and the way students learn to manage college (cut corners) as a stragegy to manage their time+books
We LOVE this book. +P+We actually received this book when Cheerios gave it away on the front of their box.  It has turned into one of our favorite books.  I am not surprised that John Lithgow could be funny, but I love that he writes for children too.  So get off of your fann-atee and buy this book. +books
Brilliant viewpoints!+N+Why of course the Chinese government was entirely to blame for the opium imported by the Scotsmen Jardine and Matheson!  It just like when Americans have a cocaine problem, it is the US government, and not the drug smugglers and dealers, that has the responsibility.  And if the Chinese folks got addicted to this narcotic, well, it's for their own good you know.  At least that's Herman's view.  Also, the Scots who thus created Hong Kong for the opium trade did not do all this hard work for money or for themselves.  Yes, they did make a little money but that's not why they were in China.  They imported opium in order to create Hong Kong so that one day it will become a "premier" commercial city of the Orient, with the ultimate goal of teaching China western financial and economic techniques.  If it were not for Jardine and Matheson, how could China have become a great power today, or a candidate superpower tomorrow?  No, these two far-sighted Scots had this noble, lofty goal in mind when they came to China, nothing lesss.  When historians condemn these two for their "crime" (drug-dealing, that is) they forget that they are actually heroes, as Herman sees so clearly and correctly.  And so it is completely unjust that a brilliant people like the Scots don't even have a country they can call their own while the "barbaric" and "decadent" Chinese do+books
Plate Tectonics as told by those that assembled the theory+P+This is a highly informative account of both the ideas that led to the development of Plate Tectonic theory and the concepts of how the earth works. The book is engaging to read and is understandable to an audience at the level of Scientific American. I am using it as a required text in my course at Columbia University titled &quot;Plate-tectonic theory and its geological corollaries&quot;. For those fascinated in how the human mind puts observations together to build ideas and then test them, this book is first rate. Each chapter is crafted by a different researcher describing his or her contribution to the over all theory. The reader encounters brilliant and original ideas discarded by peer review, scientists peeping over each other's shoulder, the rush to the goal line to publish first, competition for access to key data sets, a last minute conversion from the static earth perspective, and the thrill of exploration at sea. The authors presents a wonderful history in Chapter 1 of the intellectual passage from the first inkling of continental drift in the 16th century to the breakthrough in 1966-1968 of the full-blown theory of rigid lithosphere paving stones and narrow plate boundaries+books
love it! +P+This book is one of the best gifts I have ever recieved. I just moved into my first apartment, and was feeling really overwhelmed about getting organized and making the most of a VERY small space. This book has so many great organizational ideas that it actually made me excited to get started. It was a huge project, but thanks largely to this book, I feel really great about my new home and I honestly have never felt more organized--such a great feeling!!! Thank you so much for all of the great ideas and tips!!!  +books
Don't waste your money on the audio book+N+This is a review of the audio book version.  This has to be the worst self- help audio book I've bought.  I thought this was going to be a reading of the book, but instead the author rambles on and on - apparently paraphrasing the book.  I guess its supposed sound like a friend talking to you but I kept getting annoyed at the author repeating herself two or three times.  And where were the 100 tips?  I guess the were in there, but I couldn't listen to more than a couple tapes.  Don't waste your money... there are MUCH better books out there that give you useful, concrete steps for uncluttering and simplifying your life+books
A High School Writing Effort+N+I have read and enjoyed James Patterson in the past, but can honestly say that this will be the last Patterson book I will read.  I was truly disappointed in the lack of storytelling and writing ability.  The book had no depth, and the story suffered for it.  As I read the book I got the impression that Mr. Patterson was simply trying to crank out a book as quickly as possible, and could not be bothered with such things as descriptive detail or creative plotting.  I did not find the characters or their behavior to be believable. +books
Seaside+P+Great book to use in the classroom.  Beautiful illustrations. I have done a lot with Klimt in the classroom and this book will really help the young children enjoy him even more. And maybe inpsire lots of their own masterpieces+books
Needed a hero+N+Well, considering all the exciting things that have been happening in my life, I was surprised that reading about the life of the universe was so dull.  I can watch a sunset or listen to the sound of a bird singing and that can be wonderful.  But I suspect that if the authors were to have written about a bird singing or the sunset, I wouldn't have recognized it let alone enjoyed it much.  If this book was an attempt to synthesize science with the wisdom of all cultures then give me a genealogy from the Old Testament any ol' day.    I could tell that the authors knew a lot, but unfortunately they didn't know enough about how to capture my attention.  Now I'm no stranger to heavy reading so it can't be the density of information concealed in semi-poetic language that made the story unexciting.  I think it was the tell-me-don't-show-me style of overlong explanations of the beauty and wonder of the universe that might have been significant in this regard.  Unfortunately academicians haven't quite got the hang of how to make countless acts of procreation throughout the history of life sexy nor have they been able to capture the mystery of the ever-shy rainbow.

Advice of sibling true - they get better and better+P+My little brother passed away at just 17 years old on July 25th, and I remember when I first started reading year 4, he said that each book only get's better and I have a long way to go. Yes, it took me nearly three months to read this novel, but not because I'm that slow of a reader. More likely, the story and characters were so interesting that I preferred dragging out each chapter to save myself from moving forward to year 5. Year 4 was an excellent read with plenty of Potter goodness, not to mention the building plot's twists and turns, and the mysteries it would take a Sherlock Holmes to solve. Forget Holmes...it's all Potter and gang in this forth book by J.K. Rowling. As a reader, I highly recommend and back the series. As for my brother if he can read this from afar, man I miss you and I'm enjoying reading the stories you told me about. Thanks+books

Highbrow, lowbrow, or just plain cool?+P+A pivotal look at the development of Latin American popular music, novelist Alejo Carpentier's historical tract was originally published in 1946, and came out of raging, decades-long intellectual debates about the nature of Cuban and Latin American culture.  This is the first English translation of this work and includes a lengthy introductory essay by the editor, explaining the author's role in the Cuban intelligensia... &quot;Music In Cuba&quot; was an attempt to settle some of the controversies about the &quot;legitimacy&quot; of Cuban music, and to resolve the apparent differences between tony, Europhilic art music and the grittier rural style that came to dominate the island's popular imagination.  It's an intellectual, somewhat egghead-y book, but rich in cultural depth... The new foreward is also very valuable, giving proper context to Carpentier and his work, and a sense of the academic and philosophical life of Cubans abroad and at home in the early 20th Century+books
Great articles on defining and teaching about leadership+P+The wide variety of articles on leadership covers well items from the basic topics such as the difference between managers and leaders to how someone can be both (and the tensions that can cause!). Two of the best articles were on how leaders really spend their time during the day and how leaders foster an environment in which other people can also be identified and brought forward as leaders.  I would've rated this five stars, but there are a couple of articles (on 'defining moments' and CEOs) that weren't a complete waste of time but seemed too far divorced from the typical leader within a company that I was surprised the HBR didn't find something more likely to be widely applicable to fill the space+books
Warning this book is intended to make martyrs+N+Guerrilla Warfare: Che Guevara by Ernesto Guevara  Warning this book seems intended to make martyrs  Over the years this book has proved far more useful to mislead potential guerrillas than to educate them.  The handmade weaponry described are ineffective and or failed tools of war. The tactics suggested have led to defeat in the Americas and in Africa. The cause described has never helped the poor and down trodden.  One could readily ponder if the real intent was to make martyrs for the cause of mythical communist paradise. One wonders  how many, aside from the author, died violently because of all the above.         +books
A readable  book that deserves some credence+P+This is a warm and readable book about a fascinating subject: What happens at death, or near death? It is written by a world renowned and respected scholar and medical doctor. And, in spite of the fact that I am a Christian, with conservative beliefs, and even though I maintain my faith carefully focused on God, I do nevertheless give the accounts in this book some credence (along with its companion, written subsequently, "Life Beyond Death").  I invite you to read it and see why+books
ruined by its ignorance of female sexuality+N+I found this book embarrassing to read - not because it's risque, but because it so clearly illustrates how the French & Italians got their reputations as great lovers. Is this the best that English literature can give us? This fellow clearly understands little of female anatomy, let alone female sexuality.   It's also mean-spirited. Lawrence proves his points by setting up his version of idealized man and even more idealized woman, and then spends most of the book trying to knock down every other character and concept. This is his only real method of proving the superiority of his ideal. He drips way too much contempt.  Everything outside of sex is dumb, meaningless, ridiculous. Attempting to derive enjoyment from the "mental life" makes one ridiculous; being paralyzed makes one ridiculous; trying to have sex in any way outside Lawrence's own true and correct way makes one pathetic, or defective, or spiteful; not being able to enjoy the sort of lovemaking Lawrence proposes makes one undeserving of the title of "woman" or "man"; and so on.   Looking at Italian art is stupid. Everything in Paris is stupid. Constance can apparently tell from a glance that nobody in France knows how to have sex properly.  Reading the book without his openly contemptuous commentary on what's "wrong" with everyone except C. and M., one might easily conclude that Constance doesn't really seem happier now that she's sleeping with the gamekeeper, and Hilda does seem happier in Venice - the author counters this by ridiculing "that kind" of happiness as delusional and druglike. He even seems to imply that her being so pleased with her life is yet more proof that there's something wrong with her. Of course Constance is wretched, because she does not have that one thing that, in Lawrence's view, really matters in life - not Mellors, but Mellors' equipment. This book does degenerate into phallus-worship, which makes the author's hostility toward "druglike" pleasures seem sort of ironically comical.  Hilda is pathetic precisely because she can derive enjoyment from sensual pleasures: from Venice, from the feel of the sun, from jazz, from dancing. This seems weird to me - as if Lawrence is punishing the uppity woman. Hilda is also described as worse than pathetic - she is a "user", with strong suggestions that she is cold and immoral - because she enjoys that part of dancing which allows her to press up against a strange man, only to walk away when the dance is over. (This may be why at least one reviewer called the book sexist, since obviously Lawrence doesn't mind if Mellors is callous and behaves as a "user".)   It's actually sort of creepy how an author who seems to be claiming that sensuality is good consistently knocks sensual pleasures like the feel of sunshine on one's body. Everything is stupid except sex - and not just any sex, but his notion of real sex.   This is where astute readers will have the most trouble. Lawrence clearly defines a "real" woman - Constance Chatterly - by contrasting her with bad examples.   A woman who lays there "unfeeling" is clearly an example. Such a woman is described in terms suggesting she lacks warmth/decency/heart/womanhood/etc. Lawrence doesn't even seem to have considered the possibility that maybe what the man is or isn't doing could even be related; it's presented quite clearly as a difference between good/desireable women vs. women who are defective not only physically, but in character.  On the other hand, a woman with an unfeminine urge to be In Control - that is, one who insists on moving herself, rather than sitting passive and letting the man do what he will - is forgivable when Michaelis is the male (because he's premature, and meant to be pathetic), but it turns unforgiveable when it's women in general and especially Mellor's Bertha, who just refused to come when she should out of spite. Bertha just had a sick (!) urge to be In Control, demonstrating her essentially vicious and pathological nature. The only thing Mellors did wrong was to not put her in her place promptly - he "spoilt" her.   As for all those touchy-feely things that women so frequently enjoy? Forget it. Lawrence suggests that Mellors does at least sometimes kiss and touch, but if it happens at all it appears to be mostly incidental, nothing important. A Real Woman doesn't need foreplay. Just hop on and go, and if she's what she ought to be, she'll feel crashing waves and dark tides sooner or later.  These were what I found the most embarrassingly inaccurate - that a woman's duty is to lie there, not too passive, but not too active, and come when she's supposed to (and if she doesn't, it's her own fault); while a man's job is to climb on top and "perform". All of this is based on what ought to be a perfectly logical set of assumptions that are, unfortunately, not true. The truth is that a woman's vagina is not the equal-but-opposite inverse of a male penis; there's a thing that both males and females start out with, which in a man becomes the penis, and in the woman becomes (or remains) a clitoris. Lawrence seems to assume that what a woman feels is similar to what a man feels - but he assigns this feeling to the wrong body part.   Women have always known about their own bodies; surely a man so dedicated to the advancement of sexuality could have and should have taken more time to research how women really feel about things, preferably apart from what women think men "want to hear". This, too, is no doubt why it has been accused of being "sexist". The author (or at least Mellors) openly blames women who cannot or will not "come to the crisis" when she ought, as if it were entirely of the woman's doing and had nothing at all to do with the man.   It's also likely that science will eventually prove (if it hasn't already) that women like Constance Chatterly are not the norm or 'what a woman ought to be' emotionally as well as physically. For all that Lawrence spends an awful lot of energy ripping apart what he sees as silly, even noxious emotions and desires - such as "intimacy" and "connection", both of which he has Constance openly ridicule - biologists are increasingly finding that not only do men and women tend to have different feelings and expectations when it comes to the sex act, but that there is believed to be an evolutionary advantage in these differences, based on the notion that a man's biological job is to get his DNA out there, while reproduction for a woman involves a heavy emotional and physical commitment. If this is true, it would be the woman who takes such a cavalier and reckless attitude toward sex who is the deviant, not the one who wants to connect emotionally with the future sire of her child.   So - while there may or may not be women who feel as Constance does, at the same time it's not so clearly obvious that a woman "should" feel that way, as to justify Lawrence's open belittling of women whose emotional states don't match masculine emotional detachment and distance.  There's a lot of talk of "tenderness" - in fact, Constance keeps mentally accusing everyone in Venice of somehow "lacking tenderness" - but quite frankly I am unclear on what exactly is supposed to be so tender. The only thing he values about her is that he quite clearly likes having sex with her, but even there she only stands out particularly because a good sex partner is so difficult to find.   I can imagine a woman putting up with - but I cannot imagine a woman particularly treasuring - a man who rebuffs her when she wishes to talk, who is rude to her instead of treating her as equal (remembering she's a Lady) when she asks him questions, who calls her c--t as if that were her name, and generally treats her as if she were a whore. I could imagine a woman finding this fun if it were a game they jumped into and out of, but this is how their relationship really is; she spends far too much time begging or wanting to beg him for reassurance - for the things he won't say and the questions he won't answer - for me to find her undiluted enjoyment in their relationship particularly credible.  For what it's worth, I think life will be better when this book has become obsolete. It is exactly this sort of schlock that had women feeling pressured to fake their sexual responses - at great cost to their marriages, if not their selves. Those who agree that heppiness is linked to sexual satisfaction should be in favor of replacing this book with something that deals with sex in a way that reflects female sexuality in an honest and realistic fashion. As for those who just want a good read - I'd call it a matter of personal taste. Obviously some people enjoy this book. (Equally obviously, I did not.+books
Writer is a cad+N+I expected this book to be fun take on the Hollywood nanny experience where the reader can peek at the "other side" and perhaps try to guess who might be the real people behind the pseudonyms.  Nope.  Susanne Hansen is a cad who betrays her former employers (and her nanny friends' employers) by exposing their private family dynamics for entertainment and ridicule.  It would have been much, MUCH better had she changed names and focused more on the celebrity lifestyle gossipy end of it than in her own boring self-examinations and snotty judgements.  In every page she obsesses over wealth and then condemns the very people whose assets she admires.  She seems to think that shallow and neglectful parenting is something only to be found in the nanny-hiring set.  There was no joy in reading this book once I realized that while she may have changed the children's names, the names of the parents were quite real.  It puts the lie to how much she felt for her charges that she would so humiliate their parents in pursuit of the almighty dollar+books

Useful Drawings but Worthless 'Analysis'+N+Over the years (decades actually), Peter Eisenman's "Terragni" took on something of the urban myth, an elusive, unpublished work, supposedly of great genius.  Draft copies were jealously hoarded by a few insiders adding to the myth.  Now, after 40 years, it appears in print, no longer only the stuff of legend, but an actuality exposed to real scrutiny.  Frankly, the wait has not been worth it.  Exhaustively drafted from every conceivable projection and angle, the images of the building are accompanied by a text (a `critical text', the author repeatedly informs us), that pushes the limits only of the ridiculous.  For example: the plan of the Casa del Fascio, Eisenman "discovers", is a square, or rather, almost a square.  In order to satisfy Eisenman's supposition, the true square, it seems, is realized only when particular window is opened fully to the 90 degree position, thereby implying a volumetric extension of the building, which then completes the so-called purity of the geometry.  The fact that other windows on other sides of the building might also be opened at the same time thereby undermining the purported geometrical purity, does not seemed to have occurred to the author so blinded is he by the supposed brilliance of this, the most pretentious of studies. Numerous equally untenable speculations flesh out the remainder of this overwrought, but ultimately fruitless examination.  Terragni's classical parti is studiously avoided by the author who is largely ignorant of the precepts that underlie this, the most basic formal arrangement that Terragni carried through his design.  Eisenman stretches similar guesswork beyond the point of irritation as though insulting the intelligence of his readers is one of the underlying purposes of this book.  In the architectural industry, asinine speculation, masquerading as theory or as philosophical inquiry, are now the norm. This particular book has been billed as Peter Eisenman's "eagerly awaited magnum opus".   Certainly the Casa del Fascio is deserving of study.  However, if perchance "Giuseppe Terragni: Transformations, Decompositions, Critiques" does achieve long-lasting fame, it can only be for becoming the late 20th Century's high water mark of architectural pretentiousness and unbounded historical ignorance.

its ok but did not change my life+N+I read the book and it was ok.  The problem I find with alot of these books is the fact that it is hard to apply them to daily life.  The food required is not ordinary food but difficult to obtain and my other family members don't like it.  I would like a book that is easy to apply to my life now. If it is too exotic I don't have time to learn or to apply it and no one in my family is interested either+books
Sheer brilliance+P+I've seen a few reviews here that say "read it, but don't go see it." Most of the time, I would probably agree, because most people who do the play don't get it; they think it's a straightforward comedy, and it is almost anything but.  R&G is all about pace; except for a couple of spots, if the pace isn't almost franticly precise, the end loses its entire effect. The beginning of the second act  "Hmmm?" "Yes?" "What?" "I thought you..." "No." "Ahh."  takes a lot of work to get right; someone missing a beat is almost as bad as someone walking through the invisible fourth wall.  Guildenstern has the first real line in the play: "There's an art to the building up of suspense." If you aren't on the edge of your seat when the penultimate scene begins, then the director and the actors have missed the boat.  Unfortunately, nothing Mr Stoppard has done since is quite as good. His plays are good, especially if you like the Pinteresque types, but just not quite as good+books

A Very Good Start For Eliminating Self Sabotage+P+I Really like this book. As a professional motivational speaker, who is trained and experienced in many motivational disciplines, I find this book touches on some very key things that one needs to master in order to be a success. The part I found particularly relevant was the part on Career Acrophobia. This section really touches on why many people just don't get ahead. It explains the Glass Ceiling and Self Sabotage phenomena very well.  The only reason this book doesn't get a 5 star rating, is that it's a little weak on how to effectively address, the emotional issues it talks about. There are far more effective ways of addressing these issues, but this book does give you a good start.  I'd recommend it.  In Everything Truth, Faith and Love Destin+books

A brilliant conception of vampires which combines sci-fi and horror. Well written, atmospheric, intelligent. Highly recommended+P+Following a worldwide plague, Robert Neville may be the only man left alive. His family is dead. All the surviving humans have been transformed into vampires that surround his house very night in an attempt to break in or entice him out, attack him, and drink his blood. Holed up in his home, which he has converted into a safe house, Robert struggles with his despair and his outsider status, the constant need to seek shelter, food and protection, and the desire to discover the cause and possibly the cure of the plague. A combination of science fiction and horror, I Am Legend is an atmospheric, stark survivalist text with a truly brilliant central concept: the scientific conception and explanation of a vampire. The book is short and difficult to put down, well paced, both intelligent and frightening, and had a huge literary impact on authors in both the sci-fi and horror genres. I highly recommend it, and I consider it one of the most interesting books that I have ever read.  This read through of I Am Legend was my first time coming back to it since I read it in high school (now almost four years ago). The story has stayed very fresh in my mind over the intervening years--or, more precisely, the science of Matheson's conception of vampires. Coming back to the text, it is now very obvious to me why those aspects would stick with me so strongly. For the most part, this narrative is a method of conveying Matheson's sci-fi concepts--perhaps like any true SF author, he puts scientific concept ahead of character, and the most important aspect of the characters is not their personality or emotions but rather then impact that the story's scientific concept has on them. In the case of I Am Legend, that concept is a scientific and (mostly) logical explanation for vampires. And it's a wonderful, brilliant concept, more than unique and interesting enough for me to remember it in detail over the years. I still feel like the final development to this sci-fi idea and its repercussions happens too quickly and in limited detail, making the end of the book feel a little too fast--nonetheless, the concept is a great one, and very interesting to read about.  The flips side of that situation, however, is that the book lacks characterization and emotion. Those aspects aren't entirely absent by any means. Robert, the protagonist, has a back story, goes through emotional phases, and is greatly impacted by the apocalyptic survival setting that he finds himself in. He's realistically faulted and in many ways admirable. Nonetheless, these personal characteristics and even his interactions, past and present, exist primarily to move towards, expound on, and explain Matheson's scientific point, his conception of the vampires. In some cases, this is obvious: Richard's memories serve to build his character, but they also serve to lead him, and thus the reader, to a better understanding of the vampires. At a mere 160 pages, Matheson could have chosen to give greater emphasis to character--not so that it overwhelmed his SF ideas, but so that it provided a counterbalance to the emphasis on plot and idea found throughout the rest of the book. The lack of realistic and independently meaningful character makes those sections of the book unmemorable and makes the book as a whole a little bit too fast and too simple as a result.  Despite these thoughts and critiques, I greatly enjoy this novel and highly recommend it. Matheson achieves an incredible atmosphere in I Am Legend, one of constant paranoia and terror that never grows stale or overblown. His SF concepts are detailed, intelligent, and truly absorbing. The book combines horror and sci-fi in a way that I have never seen anywhere else and find greatly enjoyable to read. I highly recommend the text, and it's a good one to own--although short and easily readable, it's wonderful to come back to and reread. It also makes a great atmospheric yet intelligent horror/Halloween text.  I haven't read the additional texts that accompany the 300-page version, and so I can't speak for those+books
The book to read about the Siege of Yorktown+P+The Guns of Independence is one of the finest campaign/siege studies this reviewer has read on the Revolutionary War.  The volume covers the blunders committed by the British commander Lord Cornwallis and the, for once, amazing cooperation between the Allied forces under George Washington.  Of special interest is the attention given the physical operations conducted during the siege of Yorktown.  The author details the types of artillery used and the construction of entrenchments, redoubts and battery positions.  Photographs of the reconstructed fortifications help the reader visualize the action.  In additon, references to archaeological excavations are not only fascinating, but give the reader a look at the detail involved in siege warfare.       The author has done a superb job of research and his writing, though a bit stiff at times, keeps the reader interested.  The nuts and bolts of the volume are solid with crisp, clear, well-produced photographs and informative, nicely constructed maps.  This volume provides a solid education in the actions at Yorktown in September/October 1781, and for those interested in the siege, this is the volume to read. +books

The Big Bam bashes the big one!+P+It's hard to begin to praise Leigh Montville's biography of baseball's greatest slugger ever. There's a prelude written in a 'foggy,' uncertain-of-detail prose style which deals with the young George Herman Ruth's being committed to a 'boy's school,'and then drops into a dead-accurate lowdown which Montville researched diligently, right down to the brothers and young 'Nigger Lips's' discovery of the game and his rapid mastery. Montville tells true stories about The Babe's slugging, eating, drinking and sexual prowess in sometimes drop-deadpan humour, and he's a hell of a sportswriter as well. Three cheers for Montville and the Babe!!! (But hey,who hit a lifetime .371?+books
and the beat goes on... and the beat goes on...+P+There are several books out there filled with Ginsbergs ponderings (I've looked at most of them)... so why pick this one?  For one... this collection spans 48 years of A. Ginsberg's work. Highlighting poetry that  the author selected personally. Sure here you will find the ever famous  &quot;Howl&quot;, &quot;Sunflower Sutra&quot; and &quot;America&quot; as  well as, &quot;Elegy for Neal Cassady&quot; which was written by Ginsberg  shortly after hearing of his long time friend's death. However, where many  of these sort of books highlight one particular phase the author has gone  through (like a gallery showing of only Picasso's blue phase) this tome  lets the reader experience the entire Ginsberg.  I highly suggest this book  for anyone who is interested in getting to know Ginsberg and in  experiencing his greatness which spanned over 48 years (longer then his  friend Kerouac was on the planet)+books
academic, funny, balanced+P+it isn't al franken, michael moore, anne coulter or michelle malkin.  It's an objective history, with analysis and some predictions.  I'm a left-wing, liberal, european guy with a decent knowledge of US politcs and i found this book very useful in taking that to the next level.  It is definately from the "Economist magazine" stable, which is good - their pieces are well argued and very easy if your reading age is over 16.  A lot of poeple have found that coming to this book with their preconceptions isn't a bad thing - it is well researched enough and well argued enough to stimulate debate in your mind without lecturing or talking down.  They don't assert one thing or another as correct, but present a timeline and show how fragile the Conservative coalition is in reality(christians, economics, guns, "values" etc). But argues that even if the coalition fractures the strands of conservatism will remain (good or bad) for a long long time to come.  W  +books
Didn't care what happened to the main characters+N+I bought this book so I'd have something interesting to read during my son's tonsillectomy last fall.  I was hoping to enjoy the torrid love scenes in it!  I got half-way through the book, and it bothered me so much (my own issues getting in the way?), I put the book away.  I felt Anna was emotionally neglecting her daughter, Molly, while involved in her lustful dysfunctional relationship with Leo.  I didn't like any of the main characters, including Molly---all too unrealistic.  But I picked up the book yesterday and finished it.  The book was too flat!  Though I don't think she was a BAD mom, she certainly exercised poor judgment (and for what?  Like Leo was a good catch?)!  I wasted my time (I don't read books very often) on this story.  Yet I did read the whole book, hoping it would get better, so I'm giving it 2 stars.  I didn't think I'd get any more of Sue Miller's books, but other reviewers said she has better novels+books

Really didn't like it.+N+First off, I'm not a fan of the writing style. It covers so much information and time with little dialogue, or characters for that matter. But that's just the style. The way the story was presented was what I had a problem with.  It seemed like the author had a lot of interesting ideas on what he thought the end times would be like, and he didn't want to write an end-times non-fiction spiritual book, so he just presented it as fiction, but didn't quite know how to do that.   Characters are introduced simply to experience the asteroid plumetting into the earth. Then, they drop off. All of a sudden, near the end, they come back, and now they're like generals or something, or leading some kind of airstrike during the battle of Armaggedon. WHAT?!   This book is a grid, a blueprint for a certain way it COULD happen. It is not a story about people, or a story with a plot. It is just a list of events that read on until Jesus comes.   The only reason I gave it two stars was because it didn't follow the whole rapture-theory at all(that word isn't in the Bible, and even implications of one doesn't say WHEN during the tribulation it would be). In this story, the Christians are here for the whole thing, and everything isn't quite so set and orlderly and expected like the Left Behind series. It follows the premise that throughout the last century or so, we've already experienced the Seal Judgements, and that the asteroid hitting earth is the beginning of a great cataclysm that mankind is about to face.  IF you want a different take and aren't expecting much of anything else, read this, but not if you want a real story with passion or voice. +books

Blix couldn't take the candy from a baby -- just too kind.+P+&quot;Disarming Iraq&quot; is Hans Blix's thought-provoking and historically-important memoir of the few but critical months leading up to the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, during which he tried to paint a clear picture -- for the UN and the world -- of his inspection team's findings, claiming no need for urgency and lobbying for diplomacy.    The polarized atmosphere was palpably tense: while the U.S., the UK and Spain insisted that Iraq was not responding to inspections, France, Germany and Russia asserted with equal force that the inspection program had never been fully explored.     Parting the raging waters (for a few weeks, anyway) was the quintessential diplomat Hans Blix. As it reads, he was too diplomatic, unwilling to state his results confidently for fear that it might drive UN policy. It didn?t help that he had a few doubts of his own; that in spite of not finding any &quot;smoking guns&quot; in terms of banned weapons, he still sensed that Iraq was playing a cat-and-mouse game. Either the regime's odd narcissism allowed it to believe that it did not have to comply with the UN, or it was hiding something. Either way, Blix's hesitation was enough to set the stage for Colin Powell's historic February 5, 2003 presentation of evidence of WMD?s in Iraq, which was more or less the proverbial point of no return.    Apparently, what Mr. Blix was trying to tell us -- before he was drowned out by the noisy din of a fearful and overzealous media -- is now common knowledge about WMD?s in Iraq: Blix's commission failed to find anything not because the Iraqis succeeded at hiding the weapons, moving them ahead of inspections, but because the weapons really weren?t there. Iraq had disarmed at the end of the Gulf War in 1991, just as they?d claimed. The UN inspection program had worked -- without knowing it.    So how did the war move forward under false pretenses? According to Blix, &quot;a deficit of critical thinking&quot; was to blame. He speculates that our Congress would never affirm the use of force merely to end a reign of terror (even though Blix himself wishes for a UN resolution against brutal dictatorships). The Bush administration had to justify war in Iraq by linking it to terror, and since there was no real link, it had to capitalize on the &quot;theoretical&quot; link of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.    This is as far as his speculation goes. Where the phrase &quot;military industrial complex&quot; would seem most natural and expected -- followed by a salacious tell-all about Bush, Cheney and nefarious links to Saudi oil -- Blix cleverly sidesteps the issue of America's impatient itch for war by feigning ignorance. Giving Blix the benefit of the doubt, perhaps he prefers to be thought of as naive and not sensational.    Needless to say, Dr. David Kelly's death (the British scientist who leaked to the BBC that the British government had &quot;sexed up&quot; a document alleging Iraq's nuclear capabilities) was an &quot;unfortunate suicide&quot; -- and not the work of a shadow government. (The entire document, by the way, turned out to be a forgery.)    At least Blix observed the &quot;horse trading&quot; (&quot;intense economic and diplomatic pressures&quot;) our government used to obtain votes from other countries -- votes needed to pass the UN resolution authorizing the use of force -- as well as he disapproved the Bush administration?s spying on UN delegations while on their diplomatic visits to New York. Blix had other objections to U.S.-led efforts, but they are all based on facts and evidence, and are in defense of IAEA (a previous inspection organization, also headed by Blix) and UNMOVIC (the UN's Monitoring, Verification, and Inspection Commission).    Interestingly, the largest setback to diplomacy was related to a 167-page &quot;cluster&quot; document released by Blix in early March of 2003, which summarized all the inspections for the three preceding months. Unfortunately for France and Germany, American and British members of UNMOVIC leaked pre-release draft copies of the document. In other words, France and Germany had much less time to prepare their official reactions to the cluster document than their British and American counterparts. Their positions, in favor of renewed inspections, were not as compelling.    While Blix?s passion is definitely enough to carry his memoirs, one can easily see why it was so difficult for Americans to take Mr. Blix seriously: he lacks that forcible personality that commands respect. Even so, he is gifted with an even temperament, a good sense of humor, and a deeply-imbued sense of integrity, all important qualities for diplomacy. Although he may have been the only individual capable of peaceably bridging the large gap between the UN and Iraq, in retrospect it may have been asking too much from some of our leaders to match Blix?s diplomatic efforts in their reasonableness and patience+books

Yes, Stephen King really IS that good+P+HEARTS IN ATLANTIS by Stephen King  THE GIRL WHO LOVED TOM GORDON by Stephen King   Two reviews in one? What up with that? Well, I read HEARTS IN ATLANTIS some time ago and, beyond "rah rah go read this," I said it exposed my inadequacies as a reviewer. How stupid was that? I'm going to try again.   I finished reading MY LIFE by Bill Clinton late one Tuesday afternoon, then immediately picked up THE MAN WHO LOVED TOM GORDON. I figured my old friend Stephen King could clear my exhausted mind. He immediately pulled me in, and I read it in a single sitting. It's gripping stuff. Incredibly realistic, insightful regarding human nature, and it'll scare your pants off. The Master is most definitely at the top of his game with this book. Ditto with ATLANTIS.   Authors, how do you feel when you spend months (years?) writing a book only to have some reader say he polished it off in a single evening? Actually, I think you oughta feel good. No writer, not even Isaac Asimov, could/can be sufficiently prolific to be the only one a reader ever needs. I think this is very cool, and I love working with fellow authors to promote this thing we do.   Okay, back to my book review. King was always great, right? But there came a point where a certain sameness crept in. It's hard to define, perhaps, but you know what I mean. I don't think he was having as much fun as he used to, and after a time, neither were we.   Then came ON WRITING, which I never run out of breath raving about, and now books like these. He's scaling back the supernatural, which never bothered me at all, because he's found even scarier things to write about. The Master has raised his game, and it's a joy to know I've got a big old pile of unread Stephen King novels downstairs. Expect more rave reviews.   Oh, and Stephen, if you're reading this, and you ever get the desire to raise your game yet again, just let me know. I'll go rent a truck and hit you with it. (It's a joke. Just like the idea that YOU subscribe to MY rag. I know you'd rather read DAVE'S RAG.)+books
Painful to read+N+I have enjoyed Baldacci's work before but this book was simply awful.  I couldn't believe any of the characters and the storyline was terrible.  I was very surprised to get such stilted writing from Baldacci.  You can miss this one in my opinion+books
Outstanding+P+Simply put, this was an outstanding book. If you are a guy then Vince Flynn's books are for you.  Lots of action with just a touch of romance.  You become very attached to the characters, epsically Rapp and Rieley.  In the Mitch Rapp series it is hard to put one book above any other and the third option stays true to all of that, very well written.  I am by no means the fastest reader around and being a soldier myself mt time can be at a primeium but I finished this book in two days, impossible to put down+books
Disappointment!+N+This book starts out telling of the sack of Rome and grabbing the reader's attention. It's all down hill from there. The next third of the book is a long drawn out build up with very little of the book actually dedicated to the finale of the build up. The there is this a bit of drawn out rambling that leads into a sudden ending of the book. It was almost as if the writer either got tired of writing and gave up, or she just didn't know how to end it, so she just ended it. I was highly disappointed. +books
Pretentious and Boring+N+Despite what the tag line promises, this is not an epic story of WW II's most dramatic mission.  It is ridicuous to even suggest such a thing.  At best this is a superficial recounting of a late war mission which turned out not to be not nearly as dangerous as it could have been.  The bravery of the men who took part in the raid cannot be questioned.  However, there are countless other tales of WW II that recount much more horrificly dangerous events than the one depicted here.  The book simply fails to deliver.  If you are looking for a gripping tale of the horror and heroism that defined WW II this is not the one+books
What Happened?????+N+I have never written a review of a book before, but after reading this book I felt I had too. What happened to this series. The first two books were great, but this book dosen't even come close to being as good. Somebody should have cut about 300 pages from this book. The first two books in the series I could'nt put down, but this book was very difficult to finish. I dont think I will read the 4th volume in this never ending series+books
A detailed and excellent guide+P+This book contains valuable documentation of individuals with Asperger's or HFA, problems that arise and how many of the situations can be resolved.  There are some great ideas on making worksheets and charts for the individual to track his/her own emotions. This book really helps someone to realize their potential as functioning members of society.  It really gives the tools to one with Asperger's to understand and comprehend the world around them+books
A bit thin on...+N+Reading this pamphlet is one way to spend 20 minutes. However your 20 minutes would be better spent searching online for a book with a bit more "meat" on Japanese carriers+books
Very enjoyable!+P+At first when I tried to read it I thought the language was a little too descriptive but I realized that it was crucial to the mindset of this time period. In 1870's New York society, detail was everything from what food you served at gatherings to the type of carriage you rode in. Everything one did or possessed made a statement about who they are and what they stood for. You get this point clearly in the beginning when the characters are introduced. The main character Newland Archer comes from a respectable family so it would make sense that he would marry May Welland who comes from the respectable Mingott family. But things don't run smoothly when May's cousin Countess Ellen Olenska returns to America after leaving her European husband. Rumors ensue among members of society forcing Newland to take sides with Ellen because of May. But soon Newland sees in Ellen a free spiritedness that he doesn't see in May. Soon he finds himself trapped in a triangle. The whole plot kept me fascinated because just when you think something is going to happen an interesting development occurs. Just remember everything isn't what it seems in the book. On the surface a party is given for a member of the family, but underneath are harsh judgments and diversions of person's intentions. By the ending I was surprised but then again not surprised. I can see why this book is still acclaimed after all these decades+books
Karen Moriarty's biases+N+I think before people read this book they should be aware that this 'therapist' is hardly an impartial counselor. She had a strong anti-adoption bias from the start, so any testimony from her on how Baby Richard is doing is automatically suspect.+books
Fake memoir+N+This story was probably constructed from a number of real memoirs, other sources like films, and Jung's and the author's imagination.  Helmut Jung may have been a soldier on the Eastern Front but what he claims to have seen there owes more to imagination - perhaps the author's - than reality.  Units composed of seven foot Mongols? (p. 297).  Really. In the fifty or so books I have read about the German-Russian war nobody else noticed such units. In the same chapter, a description of the capture of a group of female Russian soldiers appears to have been lifted from the film version of 'Cross of Iron'.  There are numerous other elements traceable to other sources throughout ths ridiculous book. Avoid wasting money on this 'memoir'.  You will learn nothing about the real experience of combatants on the Eastern Front that you haven't already read elsewhere.+books
Laurie Colwin's best ... I've read it half a dozen times+P+I am a huge fan of Laurie Colwin's writing, so I am baffled by the reviewers who didn't enjoy this book as much as I did.  To me, her writing is sophisticated yet very comfortable.  I can identify most with the main character in this particular book of hers as I also married a bit later in life and am trying to have a child despite being a little long in the tooth.  The longings Jane Louise has for the domestic bliss that other people in her life seem to have so easily are all too familiar.  This book will not hit you over the head with a message, and it does meander ... which is just like life for most of us.  And I for one sometimes enjoy a book that doesn't leave me with a headache.  Reading is so much like eating - balancing what's good for you with satisfying cravings for those things that aren't - and for me, Laurie Colwin's books are like hot tea with milk and sugar on a cold afternoon.  Grown up, but sweet and comforting - they always hit the spot.  And I still find myself in disbelief that there will be no more books by this great writer+books
Yum+P+This wonderful book is not just full of recipes, but full of memories. Any cook book can list ingredients and directions, but not all of them also contain stories about the recipes. Mrs. Small's Crab Cakes are delicious and I don't blame Dorothy Small for keeping it to herself until the very end.  Thank you, Lari Robling and Mark Thomas+books
Disappointing+N+I've read all of Iris Johansen's novels and thoroughly enjoyed many of them--this, however was not one of them.  I found the plot hard to follow with too many references to her previous book.  What mysterious event happened to Jock and Royd?  Who is MacDuff--well if you haven't read the previous novel, you'll never know+books

Be Prepared for an Eye Opener+P+Even a few years after it's release, Eric Schlosser's "Fast Food Nation" still sends a strong message to the reader and exposes the fast food industry for what it really is... a group of very large and very powerful marketing companies... not a purveyor of good food--or nutritious food for that matter.   For many years, food additives and techniques have been the dirty little secret of the industry, but not these things are starting to surface.  The book takes you through the processing warehouses and chemical plants that the industry uses to "make" the foods served at these restaurants.  It opens your eyes to practices done to cut costs and sacrifice your health in the process.  I've recommended this book to many of my clients and many are reluctant to read it at all, probably because of the emotional attachment they have to their favorite fast food.  Since this book came out, there are so many more studies and reports on what is in the fast foods then there ever were before.  Reports including additives, trans-fats and other inflammation causing ingredients are helping the industry clean up it's act.  This doesn't mean that fast food is good for you, it just means that Schlosser has done an excellent job at bringing attention to an industry that wasn't challenged as strongly as it should have been.  I personally haven't had fast food for over 5 years, but--even that far removed--as I was reading this I felt sick to my stomach.  Read this book and you'll never step foot in McDonalds again.

Courtesy of Teens Read Too+P+Russel Middlebrook is pretty sure that he's gay.  After all, he's not attracted to girls, and he spends every day after gym class studiously avoiding the other half-naked guys in the locker room.  He's never had an actual experience with another guy, though, so maybe the attraction he feels toward them is something he'll outgrow--or maybe not.  While surfing the Internet one night, he finds chat rooms for different towns and cities, where you can talk to other people who are also gay.  And amazingly enough, there's a boy he meets with the name GayTeen-- who not only lives in his town, but also attends his high school.  Another gay boy, in his very own school?  There's no way that could be true-- especially when he finds out that the kid with the handle GayTeen is none other than Kevin Land, star of the baseball team, one of the most popular guys in school.  As Kevin and Russel get to know one another, outside of school and hidden away from prying eyes, they realize that there's no way for them to be together inside school walls.  The same is true for Russel's friends Min and Terese, who although they claim to just be really close friends, are actually in love.  So along with a few others, including Gunnar, who is straight, and Brian Bund, the loser of Goodkind High School, the boys form The Geography Club.  After all, no one else is going to want to join such a boring club--especially if they knew it was just a front for a gay/ lesbian school group.  As events at school heat up, with Brian eventually being outed as gay even though he's not, Russel, Kevin, and their friends will have to learn what's most important in life.  And that sometimes, no matter how much you might wish for things to be out in the open, you're just not ready.  GEOGRAPHY CLUB is a great, quick read from author Brent Hartinger, about the ups and downs of daily high school life, and the struggle to find ones identity+books
Class Warfare Comes to the American Revolution?+N+Gary B. Nash's purpose for the book is, "to capture the revolutionary involvement of all the component parts of some three million wildly varying people living east of the Mississippi River." (Nash, xxviii)  Nash bemoans how the "great men" still "dominate the master narrative [of the American Revolution,]" (Nash, xv) and that we are struck with "historical amnesia," (Nash, xvi) because we forgot the stories of those outside of the "great men" clique.  He states that we cannot capture the essence of the Revolution without paying close attention to the experiences of the many groups that made up colonial society.  These groups not only include the poor farmers, artisans, and other laborers, but also of women, blacks (both free and slave), and of the AmerIndian population.    Nash illustrated the problems and plights of the lower order through their myriad of stories.  To illustrate the importance of the lower classes of white society, he showed the importance of these individuals in their role as revolutionaries, which include their participation in riots against the various taxes implemented by the Parliament.  He also shows the tensions between the seaboard inhabitants and their piedmont antithesis to the west which, in his estimation, helped to spur change all along the way.  In the case of the inhabitants of what would become Vermont, he illuminated their fight against the landowners located primarily in New York City.  Led by Ethan Allen, the "Green Mountain Boys," as they would become known as, fought to keep the land that they cultivated with their own hands - against the wishes and land deeds that the New York City landowners had for their property.  (Nash, 110 - 114)  He also showed how the piedmont inhabitants of the Carolinas had to struggle for their rights to live life as they saw fit as well.  (Nash, 73 - 79)  In the case of the "Green Mountain Boys," their struggle proved to be more successful than the struggle of the Carolina piedmont, whose insurrection was brutally suppressed by then colonial governor of North Carolina, William Tryon.  Nash also shows how this sector of the population became mobilized politically during the course of the revolution.  In Nash's estimation, these people were spurred on by the rhetoric of equality in society, as championed by the Founding Fathers in the countless tracts and pamphlets that were produced during the revolutionary war era.  In Pennsylvania, the 1776 state constitution was heralded by Nash as a true revolutionary document because of its unicameral legislature, its weak executive, and its attempt to limit an amassing of wealth within the state.  He also praised the fact that artisans and lower sorts also played such a vital role in the forming of the new state constitution.  (Nash, 271 - 286)  In states where the constitution did adhere to these premises, Nash equated it with a betrayal of the will of the people, as evident by the problems Massachusetts had in ratifying their state constitution because of its more conservative outlook.  (Nash, 302 - 304)  The talk of freedom and equality also spread, according to Nash, to the black population in the American colonies.  These ideals not only spread to the free black portion of the population, but also to the thousands of enslaved blacks throughout the land.  This spread of ideas to the black population, particularly the enslaved portion, troubled white leaders, according to Nash (Nash, 59)  What was more troubling to the white slave owners was their perception that slave restlessness and even revolt was on the rise.  (Nash, 37 - 39)  What else was truly troubling to many slave holders was that the British actively recruited the slaves to fight against their masters - and all other rebels to the British Crown.  (Nash, 157 - 164)  Nash contributed much of the awareness of the enslaved to their plight the rise rising literature of freedom that the Founding Fathers were disseminating across the land.  Nash believes that this rhetoric, and its implications, were inescapable to the slaves.  (Nash, 64)  He also showed us the aftermath of the revolution for those slaves who sided with the British; they were transported off either to Nova Scotia or to the Caribbean Islands where they were subjected to an even harsher form of slavery than on the mainland.  (Nash, 426 - 427)   Women also were praised in this work, as Nash pointed out how crucial this sector of the population was throughout the course of the conflict.  First, women were important to execute the boycotts that were prevalent in the preceding years of the revolution.  Nash argued that without their co-operation in the boycotts, the measures would not have proved effective.  This is because women had a great deal of involvement in the running of the household and much of the purchasing power was in their hands.  If they did not adhere to the boycotts, the measure would have failed, in Nash's estimation.  (Nash, 141 - 144)  Nash also illustrated how the women of the revolution became active during the war, specifically in response to rising prices for necessities.  Nash showed us the response of many women in the Boston area to Thomas Boylston, a merchant whose prices on goods rose as the war progressed.  In response to these rising prices, women marched on Boylston's shop, and the shops of other merchants throughout the colonies, to procure the basic necessities for their families at what they deemed equitable prices.  (Nash, 232 - 235)  The plight of the American Indians was also great as land speculators and land hungry colonists swarmed over the Appalachian Mountain range to claim and settle upon lands that were seen as belonging to various Indian nations.  Nash showed us how the natives resisted this encroachment upon their lands through a myriad of tactics, from essentially engaging in bushwhacking warfare with the colonists who encroached upon their lands, (Nash, 253 - 255) to the fact that many Indian nations chose to align themselves with the British in their cause to suppress the rebellion.  (Nash, 151 - 157)  What was more alarming to Nash is the colonists' "genocidal" policies towards the native population.  (Nash, 377 - 381)  Although it may not seem like it, there is an underlying premise to Nash's illustrations in the struggles of all of the aforementioned groups during the American Revolution.  That premise with Nash, at first alluded to, and then by the end of the book, states bluntly is class warfare.  There is, however, a very real problem in this Marxist outlook on American society during the era of the Revolution, specifically that the colonists did not view the class structure in the same light that we do today, or even as class was viewed in when Karl Marx wrote his tracts on such matters.  As Gordon Wood pointed out in his work, The Radicalism of the American Revolution, "The social distinctions and economic deprivations that we today think of as the consequence of class divisions, business exploitation, or various isms - capitalism, racism, etc. - were in the eighteenth century usually thought to be caused by the abuses of government."  (Wood, 5)  Wood also pointed out that there were complexities and variations to American society, which fell along "local, regional, sectional, ethnic and class differences."  These complexities made, "any generalization about Americans as a whole," quite difficult.  (Wood, 6)  Wood further illuminated the difficulties of following such a class distinction as Nash proposed in his work.  Wood stated in his review on Nash's work in the "New Republic Online": Nash's evidence for popular resistance to all this class exploitation is the incidents of rural rioting and urban mobbing that took place in the decade or so leading up to the Revolution.  This mobbing and rioting is exceedingly familiar to historians, who have produced a literature about it.  Unfortunately, these phenomena do not support Nash's argument.  Not only did the rural rioting have little or nothing to do with the Revolution, but the urban mobs, which were indeed directed at British authority, did not represent the class upheaval that Nash assumes.  The rural riots all arose out of peculiar local circumstances, and were hardly expressions of some sort of coherent class warfare.  (Wood, "New Republic Online Review)   Wood, in his review of Nash's work, went on to illustrate exactly what constituted the true dividing lines in American society when he stated: But what of all the rhetoric about the laboring people contesting the aristocratic few that Nash draws on to make his case for class warfare?  There was indeed a serious division in eighteenth-century American society that reverberated through the northern states over the succeeding decades, but it was not the one that Nash describes.  Instead of being divided between a rich upper class and a poor working class, as Nash sees it, anachronistically anticipating a later nineteenth-century division between employers and employees, eighteenth-century American society was in fact still divided between a leisured gentry and the mass of artisans and other laborers who worked with their hands--many of them the businessmen of the future.   In Nash's work, he viewed many of the Revolutionaries as having ulterior motives for their proclamations of equality and freedom.  Nash, I would argue, hinted toward the idea that the Founding Fathers only took part in the revolutionary movement to benefit themselves.  Throughout the course of the book, Nash takes great care to "expose" the double standards of the Founding Fathers, making them seem as if they merely wanted to continue their "elitists" lifestyle at the expense of the commoners below.  There is no bigger whipping boy for Nash than John Adams, who, according to Nash, was essentially a closeted monarchist who was afraid of the people.  To be sure, Adams did have his reservations about the people, but it was more a fear of a "tyranny of the masses" than it was an outright fear that the people would displace the leaders of the new nation.  However, what is truly ironic is that Nash relied so heavily upon the writings of John Adams to illustrate many of his points.  Not only did he rely on Adams' writings, but also the writings of many of the other Founding Fathers.  Throughout the course of the book, when Nash referred to any of the writings of the Founding Fathers, I found myself wondering if Nash was cropping their words to support his case.  It is my belief that this is something that seriously needs to be explored in greater depth than I can provide here.  What is also ironic is that Nash makes little use of the narratives of those whose stories he claimed he wanted to tell.  Outside of the use of Joseph Plumb Martin's narrative of his experiences as a soldier in the Continental Army during the war and the autobiography of Ethan Allen, he does not make extensive use of the diaries and letters of many people who lived through the war experience, both in the military and in the civilian sector.  To be sure, there are many diaries out there from those below who can illuminate their thoughts throughout the era.  Would their writings bear out what Nash proposed?  Nash criticized the Continental Congress for not being able to pay the soldiers their salaries.  This inability to pay the soldiers wages stemmed from the fact that the government was essentially broke: they were unable to levy taxes on the people of the colonies because of the weak governmental structure from which they operated and many of the colonies did not pay their fair share of the financial burden of the revolution.  When Robert Morris tried to restore fiscal responsibility to the war effort and raise revenue to provide pay and necessities to the army, Nash viewed it as an attempt to "tame the social and political radicalism of the Revolution."  (Nash, 367)  However, I suppose Nash chose to forget the fact that Morris was trying to get revenue to provide for the war effort.  Why then would Thomas Paine, one who Nash seemed to have great respect for his principles of democracy, agreed to author a pamphlet on behalf of Robert Morris in favor of his new fiscal plan.  (Nash, 395)  If Morris' plan was so stifling to democracy, intended to roll back the radicalism of the revolution, then why would Paine agree to be a party to it?  Not all of these explanations and questions would mesh well with Nash's outlook on Morris and the Founding Fathers at large.  Further, if the Founding Fathers truly wanted rule for themselves, there was no better chance for one of them to establish it than with the "Newburgh Conspiracy."  It is true that the soldiers and officers of George Washington's army were deeply distraught by the ineffectual abilities of the Congress to pay wages and provide for basic necessities.  (Nash, 370 - 371)  However, what Nash failed to mention is the other half of the conspiracy.  The men wanted to march on the Continental Congress and put George Washington in power.  Washington, through an impassioned speech and performance, quelled all of these thoughts and possibly saved the revolution once again.  Nash, as stated previously, believed the struggle of the thousands of black slaves in the colonies was heightened by the revolutionary rhetoric that littered the landscape of the era.  He believed that such literature raised their awareness and caused more unrest and rebellion than at any time previously.  However, I would like to offer my own take on this.  Did it take pamphlets from the Founding Fathers to raise the awareness of the enslaved that there was something unnatural about their situation?  I certainly think not.  Frederick Douglass' autobiography indicates that from a very early age, he was well aware that there was something wrong with the situation he found himself.  In an illustration, a still teenage Douglass talked with some of his young white friends on the streets of Baltimore and they complained about their lot in life.  Douglass illustrated the point when he wrote, "You will be free as soon as you are twenty-one, but I am a slave for life!"  (Douglass, 53)  While Douglass certainly is an exceptional individual, I doubt that this same premise was lost on the countless enslaved individuals in the colonies and that they wanted freedom and it did not take pamphlets for that realization to come to mind.  Nash lamented the "genocidal policies" towards the AmerIndians adopted by many colonists during the revolution.  While it is true that atrocities were committed against the natives, first, this was nothing new by this point in American history.  Warfare between the natives and colonists was an almost constant from the time that European settlers stepped onto the New World.  In such a climate, atrocities committed by both sides in this armed and almost perpetual struggle were inevitable.  However, Nash is somewhat disingenuous when he makes the native population seemingly innocent or justified in their actions.  Although Nash admitted that the British courted and armed the native peoples to fight the colonists, even after the revolution was over, he cannot seem to find any justification for the colonists to meet force with force.     Lastly, as stated previously, Nash bemoaned how historians and the people at large have lost the viewpoint of those below the Founding Fathers - how the great men still consistently dominant the narrative on the American Revolution.  (Nash, xv)  First, I would ask Mr. Nash, "should we discount what the `great men' did during the war?"  While historians do deal with the "great men" of the American Revolution, I doubt there is one serious historian out there who would discount the actions and sacrifices that were made by the people below.  Their deeds do not go unnoticed in narratives of the war.  We read about the Boston Tea Party, we read about the non-importation of British goods and how the participation of the common people was vital to such an enterprise.  We read about the plight of the Continental soldier as they nearly starve and free to death in the service of their country.    What Nash further discounted was the explosion over the past decades in dealing with various social aspects of the history of the revolution.  Bruce Chadwick's piece, The First American Army: The Soldiers of the American Revolution, he offered the reader a look into the world of the solider in the Continental Army through their diaries, letters and records.  Through these written records, we are presented with the bleak situation that so many found themselves in - conflicting interests between home and duty, the want of food and clothing, and their battle experiences.  Alfred Young, in The Shoemaker and the Tea Party, offers a glimpse into the world of the common man on the streets, taking part in demonstrations and actions against the British and their oppressive measures.  Women's roles in the revolution are far from ignored.  Mary Beth Norton authored a book, Liberty's Daughter's: The Revolutionary Experience of Women: 1750 -1800, dealing specifically with the trials and tribulations of the women during the American Revolution, both from the Patriot side and the Loyalist side.  Linda Kerber also wrote a piece on women in the American Revolution entitled, Women of the Republic: Intellect and Ideology in Revolutionary America, which also draws upon the revolutionary experience of women through their diaries, letters and legal papers.  The Native Americans receive their fair share of print as well.  Alan Taylor wrote Divided Ground: Indians, Settlers, and the Northern Borderland of the American Revolution, which offers a rich, sprawling history focusing on the Iroquois Six Nations of New York and Upper Canada during the era of the American Revolution.  Taylor examines Indians' wise but unsuccessful attempts to hold onto their land as colonists encroached on it.  Colin Calloway, in his work, The American Revolution in Indian Country: Crisis and Diversity in Native American Communities, explored the internal strife that the revolution brought to Indian nations involved with the American Revolution.  The African-American population in the revolutionary era also received a fair amount of print about their ordeals.  Glenn Knoblock wrote, Strong and Brave Fellows: New Hampshire's Black Soldiers and Sailors of the American Revolution: 1775 - 1784, which explored the military careers of over 200 black military officers during the American Revolution and attempted to reconstruct their ordeal throughout the conflict.  Sylvia Frey, in her book, Water from a Rock: Black Resistance in a Revolutionary Age, explored the triangular relationship between the British, the Americans, and slaves in the South.  Through this triangular relationship, Frey attempted to illustrate the complex and confusing options presented to the slaves in the South during the rebellion.  Beyond the Founders: New Approaches to the Political History of the Early American Republic, edited by Jeffrey Palsey offers readers an alternative reading in the same light that Nash presents, the conflicting desires of the myriad of peoples during the American Revolution.  The political historians contained in this work showed that the early history of the United States was not just the product of a few "Founding Fathers," but was also marked by widespread and passionate popular involvement; print media more politically potent than that of later eras; and political conflicts and influences that crossed lines of race, gender, and class.  Thus, this work is not beholden to one particular point of view on the revolution, as Nash is guilty of being caught up in.  These are just some of the books out there on the myriad of topics that Nash covered and, to be sure, there are many more.  These books are not hard to find.  Just do a search on Amazon's or Barnes and Noble's online stores on any of these topics and you will be presented with a cornucopia of choices - there is not quite the neglect that Nash claimed in these fields.  To be sure, there will still be authors who write biographies on the "great men" of the American Revolution, but there are many who also explore the social history of the conflict.  Thus, Nash is not the lone voice for these "forgotten" as he claimed+books
An extremely poor attemt at a spy/thriller+N+I had to force myself to finish this book. I don't allow myself to move onto a new read until I've finished the one that I've started, and this by far was the most difficult to get through. The dialogue between characters is laughable, the promising plot points are either too rushed or go on for far too long thereby destroying any bit of excitement that could be felt from them. Ted Bell's description and background on these characters makes them too unbelievable either by allowing them every positive characteristic (Alex Hawke) or changing their characteristics when its convenient (bin Wazir). There is nothing endearing about this novel, I honestly cannot believe this book was ever a bestseller. Do yourself a favor, bypass this book and read the 007 series by Ian Fleming.+books
Helpful ideas for those who struggle to organize+P+The Organizer Lady, Sandra Felton, is back with Organizing Magic: 40 Days to a Well-Ordered Home and Life. Actually, Felton explains at the beginning that these are not forty consecutive days because some of the projects require a change of thinking, such as finally feeling that you can invite someone into your home. It's more accurately described as forty projects than forty days.   Felton offers ideas as varied as dealing with the paper crunch, saving time, e-mail, organizing closets, efficient movements, developing a visitor-friendly attitude, and upgrading your home. (No, she doesn't mean blowing it up and starting from scratch as my mom has suggested!) She gives the reader permission to reject whatever projects don't work for you while developing a new style of thinking.   Felton is an engaging writer with a practical, friendly style. She lets readers struggling with clutter not feel guilty. Angry yes, guilty no. Most chapters include several helpful pointers and boxed quotations to encourage you such as, "If you can't move the mountain, move a few stones. If there is a better solution...find it," by Thomas Edison. The book ends with a resource bibliography.   One of the good things about the book is that she provides options for you to consider and suggests you choose one that you feel comfortable with. For instance, in her chapter on making bold judgment calls, she gives you eleven project choices which range from dropping out of a club, giving up addressing Christmas cards by hand, throwing out all mail with a bulk postmark unopened, rotating your visible knickknack collections, using paper plates for quick clean up, and more.   Some of her suggestions sound familiar to me because I've read one or two of her books over the years, so those who have read some of her other books may want to look this one over before purchasing it. Those who are new to the struggle to organize their lives will find her ideas helpful and her writing engaging. - Debbie W. Wilson, Christian Book Previews.com +books
Another handy book from Sandra!+P+I LOVE all of Sandra Felton's books and this one is no exception!

I really, really love Cliff Janeways' books. The ultimate in smart mysteries....+P+Janeway has opened an entire new world to me. As an avid reader who has a book in almost every room in the house including the garage, bathroom, and who reads during ironing, doing homework, or waiting for sugar to boil for making English Toffee, I can almost assuredly recognize not only genres but also the various nuances within the genres. JUst as women in this day and age tend to head towards tough broads who can fend for themselves in a man's world, Janeway brings in a cop whose adoration of written materal causes him to leave his probably more steady job as a policemen, to enter the world of rare books. An occasional job will bring in enough money to support his chosen lifestyle for a while, but more than that, his introduction into the interesting and secretive world of bibliophiles. These books not only whet my appetite for this world, but also introduces me to both real people and real books that helped to shape our world from behind the scenes.   Janeway's current flame has an old friend (who also delved into books) killed, and she wants him to find out who did it an what t he motive was. In doing so he ends up becoming involved in his lover's old friends and flames, so of which should be left undisturbed. But Janeway never  is one to back down from a fight over 'rights and wrongs', and he doesnt' do that in this book either. I get the feeling when I read other reviews that the readers want something less complicated than what Janeway provides. If uncomplicated is what the readers want then they should go to other books, becasue there are times in Janeway's books that you just have to go back and understand why certain things are said or done in a true historical background and reality.   I wish Janeway could write fast than he does, because I thoroughly enjoy these very educated mysteries, but then, if he did write that way Janeway would not be as enjoyable as he is.  Karen L.

Don't fail to read this if you're new to Earth+N+In today's world, various forms of parochialism have a dialectical relationship with the homogenizing influences of globalizing consumer capitalism. These forms of parochialism may be ethnic, "cultural," religious, nationalistic, etc., depending on where you look. On one hand, ancient forms of identity continue to define in-groups and out-groups; on the other hand, multinational corporations elide these differences as they operate in a wider and wider worldwide marketplace.  Example: the Turks and the Armenians hate each other and even partly define themselves by this ancient conflict ("Jihad" is Barber's label for this); yet they see the same Pepsi ads and do the same kinds of work in their local Pepsi bottling plants ("McWorld" is Barber's label for this).  That's the book.   This might be a useful resource for writers of term papers who need to endnote something fairly obvious. Outside of that, it would take an observer from another planet to find this book's insights novel or pointed. If you're new to planet Earth, by all means pick up a copy. It will catch you up on a few useful truisms.  As others have pointed out, the "terrorism's challenge to democracy" subtitle seems intended to capitalize on 9/11, but doesn't accurately reflect the book's content. "Jihad" is deployed as a synecdoche in this book; Muslim extremism is just one of the book's many examples of parochialism+books
A piece of hogwash! +N+"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" - the version I have is from 1955, and includes the original written Act Two, and the Act Two version Tennessee Williams wrote for Broadway.  That said, I found this play to be the worst Williams play.  I read "The Glass Menagerie" and "A Streetcar Named Desire" and I found both to be emotional, engaging, and thought provoking.  This play does not include any of that.  I failed to see the point, and I didn't understand the motivation for the cruelty shown to Margaret (Maggie).  I was very disappointed.  I do not recommend.+books
For Advanced only+N+This book is attractively laid out and demonstrates (briefly) some techniques for people who have the knowledge to use them.  I don't have it unfortunately.  The authors say that knowing Photoshop would be "helpful"; I suspect it's required in order to do the digital printing described here.  They also recommend a more basic text on digital printing to understand this book, and that kind of knowledge also appears to be required.  That and a big printer!  If I were qualified to use the information, I would probably give it 4 or 5 stars.+books
misleading title+N+Despite what the book title "Grammatically Correct", this book is mostly about punctuation usages.  Grammar is limited to a thin, single chapter.  There are not sufficient materials on grammar to alert you on incorrect usages, let alone correct them.  I would recommend "Painless Grammar" over this title+books
A Few Stars Short of a Constellation+N+I recently purchased this book and was somewhat disappointed when I sat down to read it. The subtitle is &quot;Games &amp; Puzzles to Stimulate Your Creativity &amp; Imagination&quot;. Actually, there are only some  thirty such puzzles and many of them are 'old chestnuts'. However, my  biggest complaint is the lack of accuracy. The very first puzzle (p. 20)  has a mistake in it. Then in 'Mental Counting' (p. 161), the author claims  that the letters O and U are not symmetrical about the vertical axis. As  for 'Three-dimesional Dots' (p. 199) the text states &quot;Below is a  collection of random dots.&quot; Unfortunately, the random dots have been  omitted. So much for &quot;something remarkable&quot; happening as the  author claims. And how's this for one of the three (yup, only three)  lateral thinking puzzles? What common word begins with IS, ends with ND,  and has LA in the middle? I bet that really stretched your brain, didn't  it? Sorry, but Mr. Wujec's editor should be fired. These glaring mistakes  and omissions have scuttled any enjoyment I may have expected from this  book. I suspect the author was motivated by the commercial success of his  previous book. He should have waited until he had something of value before  publishing this schlock+books
Ethan Walker does NOT know Christ+N+Ethan Walker's "The Mystic Christ" does NOT AT ALL understand or explain the REAL Jesus Christ.  I'll return this literature as soon as I get the chance. It's completely bogus (with very little truth to it)I mean this man totally misunderstands the plan for redemption, what real love is meant by Christ, and any other reality pertaining to Christ.  If you want to understand Christ, TRULLY, then learn about Him from St. Francis of Assisi, St. John of the cross, St. Teresa of Avila, St. Vincent Ferrer, Fr. Reginald Garrigou - Lagrange, Dom Vitalis, Henry Manning, St. Thomas Aquinas, Sister Josepha Menendez,. Etc....These days it's very popular to twist and distort Jesus Christ by saying Lo here is "A" Christ and Lo there is "A" Christ.  This book lacks in real knowledge of Christ.  While some of this litarature has good points (not on Christ of course but on Buddha and Krsna,etc it does) it really only shows the authers lack of understanding Jesus' real plan and reason for His Incarnation.  The book should have been called "The Mystic Life" and NOT "The Mystic Christ".  Totally misleading and insulting toward Christ (Not "THE" or "A" Christ)....  If you want to be mislead then read this book.  If you want to be lead in the correct path then read "The Way Of Divine Love" by Sister Josepha Menendez if you really want to know THE REAL Jesus Christ (There is no Lo here and Lo there and there is no word "THE" and letter "A" in Christ). Do not fall for this sort of Neuro-Linquistic Programming...+books
Awful+N+I asked a friend for recommendations for a mindless beach read, and she suggested this series.  I've suddenly lost a lot of respect for her.

What!!! No GARLIC????+N+I was hoping to buy an Italian food cookbook.  What I got was a cookbook about Italian "inspired"  creations that he, the author, himself created. Mostly this book seems like a pat on his back for he mentions how everyone loves this or that dish every few pages....and he is proud because he made all the recipes himself!! Not authentic to me.  Hardly any recipe contains garlic and I feel forced to doctor the recipes in order to get any flavor.  My only hope for this book is that the deserts (I haven't tried one yet) makes up for the rest.  Review addition:  OK...so the Tiramasu was VERY good.  Bought Lady Fingers at Trader Joes just to save you the effort of looking in every grocer and not finding it like I did.+books
Get Out Your Plow and Harness Old Nellie+P+...to get a little tilling done before someone steals and eats her.  I chose this book for my second read on this subject because it has the highest ratings (on subject) on Amazon.  Heinberg has done a thorough job of discussing every aspect of the coming problems to society due to a lack of petroleum - most of which I had never considered.  Literature about this are from the point of view of either the politician, the economist, or the geologist.  He takes the view of the geologist and the future does not look good.    I hold a more positive view: that human ingenuity will prevail - but I could easily be wrong.  In any case, this is a worthwhile read for anyone.  Of particular interest is the chapter that deals with alternate energy sources.  The next time you read about an alternate energy source in the news, you'll remember the real pro's and con's from an expert.  Quick synopsis of 41 page alternative fuel chapter from "Party's Over:"  Natural Gas:  Cannot be shipped from overseas easily like oil - is more difficult to extract economically every year - is being depleted like oil.  In view of the precarious status of North American gas supplies, any attempt to shift to NG as an intermediate fuel would waste time and capital in the enlargement of an infrastructure that will soon be obsolete.  Coal:  Shortage not so much a problem, however, its EROEI (Energy Return On Energy Invested) and pollution are a problem.  As the richer seams are exhausted, it may cease to be a useful energy source within only 2-3 decades.  Nuclear:  Electricity from existing nuclear plants is inexpensive, but only if direct costs are considered.  When adding in plant construction, safety, reactor decommissioning, and waste storage - nuclear power is very expensive indeed.  There are currently 442 reactors operating worldwide.  France in the only country in Europe still building them.  Only Asia expects to expand significantly.  Only a few of the highly touted fast breeder reactors have been built, and they have proven to be prohibitively expensive.  The US currently processes enough uranium to fuel existing US reactors for the next 40 years.  The mining process is wasteful, polluting, and dangerous. When all things are considered, the EROEI on nuclear energy is fairly low and there is significant intangible downside.  Wind:  Of all renewables  (not depletable), wind power usage on a global scale is being developed the fastest.  Technology has advanced - it no longer kills birds because it uses slower fan speeds and the fans are mounted on a vertical axis. It can operate in more variable wind speeds and the cost is declining rapidly.  Soon your own equipment could be bought and used on your own property.  Wind has the best EROEI and Germany leads the world in its usage.  On a large scale, wind power would require vastly new infrastructure, but it is the most practical alternative so far.   Problem: cannot easily be converted to fuel transportation and agricultural needs.   Solar:  Technology advancing rapidly, photovoltaic the best so far.  Research is advancing into diverse methods of collection, including such easy methods of application as solar buckyball collectors incorporated into house paint.  Tremendous potential, would need new infrastructure. Problem: cannot easily be converted to fuel transportation and agricultural needs.  Hydrogen:  For now, the process of hydrogen production always uses more energy than the resulting hydrogen will yield.  For one thing, hydrogen is not an energy source, but an energy carrier.  It's production depends on continued usage of the dwindling supply of natural gas.   There is new technology, however, and reason to be optimistic.  As with wind and solar, a whole new infrastructure, requiring time and investments of huge amounts of money and energy technology are necessary.   Like wind and solar, hydrogen fuel cells should be central features of our plans to phase out petroleum.  We should be dramatically increasing these investments.  Hydroelectric:  In many regions of the world - and especially in the US - it is already thoroughly exploited.  Geothermal power, tides, and waves: limited application in limited regions of the world.  Biomass: wood burning - pollution and limited resources in a world with 6 billion people - imagine the world being one big Easter Island.  Ethanol: costs more energy to produce than it eventually delivers to society.  Brazil is the poster child, but is burning down rain forests to grow sugar cane.  Cold-Fusion: pseudoscience  Conservation - Efficiency and Curtailment:  Will be crucial in cushioning impacts from the depletion of oil.  But it is not a panacea - even when you ignore cheaters (individuals and countries).    Saudi saying:  My grandfather rode a camel.  My father rode in a car.  I fly a jet airplane.  My grandson will ride a camel.     +books

Could Not Put Down+P+Rarely is there a book that I can not put down, this was an exception. Quite a suspensfull page turner. Any book that can draw you in and you can visualize the characters and the scenery is excellent and this book did that. I would have given it 5 stars, but I do not like romance blended in with any suspense novel, that's just my taste.  By far,  however, one of the best books I have read in a long time+books
Not worth it+N+I bought this book because of all of the good reviews. I was NOT impressed. First of all, the writing is mediocre at best. The stories offer little in the way of meaningful character development and delve right into poorly worded sex scenes. The first three stories I read were about anal sex, watching your wife give another man oral sex and humiliating your husband by tying him up and ball-gagging him then penetrating him with a strap on. To be honest these stories turned me OFF and I'll be returning the book. Save your money this is not good+books
Typical gay fare - not worth the time+N+Many people have mentioned the embarassing cover art to this book. I agree and it is also very misleading. The characters in the book do not even resemble those guys - the main character's love interest is an artist who looks nothing like the clean cut characters on the book jacket.  Things we can do without in gay fiction from now on:  1. A spoiled egotistical self indulgent main character. Yes this may apply to some gay guys but its just BORING now in the books.  2. A distant disapproving father and eccentric mother. YAWN  3. The flamboyant gay friend (usually black)   First this book starts as a character study - will this selfish debt ridden loser get his act together? - then it morphs into some sort of romance (never worth your time) - then has a whole chapters about the running of an escort service (fairly interesting) and ends with a kind or frenetic black humor. It never gels.  I kept waiting for the big romance and it was incredibly lame. Was my heart supposed to be warmed about him doing threesomes with his new boyfriend and a client????  If you want a real book about running and escort agency read the MAYFLOWER MADAM's book. At least it's interesting.  If you HAVE to read a book about a selfish gay man - I recommend "California Screaming" and forget this trash. +books
Really bad book+N+I don't know who wrote the 5 star reviews of this book, but they're like those actors in bad TV ads claiming that they lost 100 pounds in 8 weeks. Those rave reviews are hard to stomach. This is a really bad book--I agree with the person who said that they would give it zero stars if they could (half the book IS empty blank pages for your journaling). There is not much that's helpful in this book. Much better and thorough are (1)  The Thyroid Solution by Ridha Arem, (2) Living with Autoimmune Disease by Mary J. Shomon, & (3)Thyroid Power by Richard L. Shames and Marilee Halo Shames. These books are better researched and are compassionately and well-written by M.D.'s and/or persons with personal experience with thyroid problems.  Skip this book by Dirgo+books

Animal Psychobabble+N+I dislike writing negative reviews but I'll make another exception here. My wife showed me this book one lazy Saturday afternoon in a local bookstore. "I want you to look at this. It was such a good idea but he messed it up so badly."  This book should have developed real conjecture on the emotional lives of farm animals. It could have been a serious discussion of what we understand about animal emotions both positive and negative. It would have demonstrated how the natural farming movement has the potential to revolutionize animal husbandry and improve farm animal living conditions. Should have, could have, would have ... it didn't.  He apparantly intuits emotions from these creatures who at the very least do not speak his language and at the most are experiencing very different emotions than the ones he describes. Doubtless he is gifted with superhuman intuitive ability from his years of analytic training; us mere mortals would be unable to consistantly reproduce his observations.  (As a brief example look at the emphasis on eye expressions despite a lack of evidence for any real facial expression translatability across species lines. Urban readers cannot readily observe farm animals to verify this so I'd suggest a trip to the local zoo to test my counter assertion. There, the most casual observer can see that a broad, friendly human smile will send an entire cagefull of monkeys into conniptions. Why? Because many species of simians translate 'smile' as 'teeth-baring dominence display'.)  Nevertheless I rated this book 2 stars instead of one, as there were a few interesting anectdotes interspersed amongst the verbage.  (Edited to add a note about trembling cows.) Cows tremble when they are annoyed by flies. Having no hands their first line of defence is their tail, but flies often land on shoulders and other body parts out of its limited reach. They tremble, shaking their skin to dislodge the pests. They shake their heads, sometimes violently. Their eyes roll and they sometimes look like they're going to fall over. I suppose it is convenient for the writer of this book that flies congregate where cows are penned together but more so that people have forgotten the 2000 year old story of Io, Hera and Zeus.+books
Terrific, Insightful Book+P+I think some of the negative impressions of this book stem from the fact that people were expecting something different from "Joe Bob Briggs." Well, the truth is that before he was Joe Bob's, real name is John Bloom and he was (and is) a fantastic award winning investigative journalist.  His serious side really shines here. He has written a very accessible, erudite and enjoyable book of criticism here, and his critiques of these challenging films still resides within a moral frame work. He strikes a balance here that I think few critics could pull off given the subject matter.   But mainly it's just a great read, even for those that aren't necessarily film buffs. The generous and well-done layout is also worth commending. I highly recommend.+books

Very Difficult to Follow - Frustrating Writing Style+N+Gosh, maybe I shouldn't review this book, but then - any book that I bring home that is so difficult to follow that I just couldn't finish it probably deserves one star. While the subject matter was of great interest to me, the writing style was not a comfortable read. I was constantly trying to remember who was who, what time period it had just jumped to and then jumped to again and, worst of all, the flow of the words was simply missing. Hard to pinpoint the problem, but by Page 42 I was so confused and frustrated, not entertained, and wondering why I was working so hard to read it when I had a stack of other promising new works waiting. (Now I'm readin 'A Long Way Down' by Nick Hornby and was mesmerized from the first page. A perfect example of a well-structured story that just glides from page to thought-provoking page.

sad+N+Hello to all those who have read this book.  After reading your reviews abour this book i felt i must say something.  WHy are you so set against God and Christianity?  One of you said this book was what made him rejest Christianity.  Christianity is not some weird religion,  it is the faith that Jesus Christ died for all humans, who He loves so much.  Where are you going after you die?  Christ is waiting for you to call to Him and ask for eternal life.  The Bible isnt some whack job scribbling stuff down, it is God inspired.  There are more manuscripts and texts to prove the Bible is real and written by those who claimed to write it.  there are more manuscripts than that of Homer's The Odyssey, yet we regard that as true.  So the Gospels werent written right after the disciples were with Jesus, but they were written at a time when those people could still remember their times with Christ.  I am going to wrap it up now, but if you want to hear the real TRUTH, read God's Word.  If you don't believe that, there are so many books that so the incredible evidence for the Bible.  The Age of Reason was written by a man who hated Christianity.  PLease do not just accept his writing without looking at the BIble.  Jesus Christ loves you, and he longs for you to accept Him so He can change your life and give you the awesome gift of eternal life with Him.  Thank you+books
Not quite what I was expecting+P+A Journey to the Center of the Earth did not turn out to be quite what I was expecting; I can't say quite why, however, because I'm not entirely certain what those expectations were.  I hadn't read the novel previously, but I thought I knew what it was about.  As a result, I think I was expecting more drama than Verne delivers, or perhaps I simply wanted the book to be more than it is.  Most likely I was conflating Verne's novel with other texts: movie adaptations of the novel itself, for instance, in which considerably more in the way of actual antagonism--as opposed to the perils of nature itself--occurs; or hollow world stories, in which entire societies thrive on the inside of the earth's crust beneath the rays of a sun that lies at the planet's center.  A Journey to the Center of the Earth is neither of these things, of course, and if I underwent any disillusionment, it was purely of my own making.  Understood on its own terms, the novel is, at the very least, interesting, but, truthfully, not much happens.  The narrator's speculations (as well as his fevered dreams during times of travail) suggest a much wilder adventure than actually takes place.  Much of the action involves the trio of explorers stumbling around in caverns and tunnels, and much of the impediment takes the form of hunger, dehydration, or equipment loss.  In fact, as best I can judge, they really don't approach anywhere near the center of the earth, although they do travel quite a distance laterally before resurfacing.  The real joy is the interactions between the characters, primarily the trio of protagonists: the young narrator, his scientist uncle, and their silent, idiosyncratic guide.  The expedition leader is an archetypal nutty professor, whose words and actions seem nonsensical to those not privy to his thought processes; his nephew, the narrator, alternates between sheer wonder at his surroundings, and sheer terror at the likelihood of spending the rest of his short life surrounded by them; Hans, the guide, says almost nothing but performs his duties in an exemplary manner, and insists on being paid weekly rather than all at once, even while under the earth (a square deal, in his eyes).  Their interactions with each other, and with the variety of Icelandic folk they encounter on their way to the volcano which is their means of ingress, are wittily and cleverly depicted.  These character moments are the high point of the novel; one wonders how much of their clever interplay originates with Verne and how much is an invention of the translator (who, in this edition, remains sadly anonymous).  Whether the novel's tone in its English version is added or simply preserved in translation, full marks to whomever this perceptive soul is.  Though one reflexively considers Jules Verne a "science fiction" writer of a primitive sort, this is really more of an adventure tale and, taken as such, it is generally successful.  The adventurers don't explore a strange new world so much as become more intimately acquainted with the world they already know, but if the reader doesn't go in expecting flights of pure fancy, the novel is rather satisfying.  Postscript: I should point out that this review refers to the Signet Classic mass market paperback edition of the novel, which features an afterword by Michael Dirda.  Knowing Amazon, it's possible that this review will surface under several different versions, and without clarity, we have nothing.+books
A voice for those who do not have a say right now.+P+Promises made are not always promises kept.  We all say that we want education to be a priority for all.  Do we all really support that?  The Shame of the Nation exposes the compliancy that many Americans have when it comes to actually promoting equal opportunities for all.  We want our professional athletes and Olympic contestants to be able to compete and train in the best facilities and with the best practices.  This enables them to reach their fullest potential and beyond.  We should all be willing to support this endeavor for the education of all of our students.  This book helps us to walk in another's shoes and truly empathize with the inequaties that so many children must deal with.  Reading this book should open ones eyes to how many future adult American are set up for failure.  Brown vs. Board of Education may have imposed laws for equality but it must go further into the mindset of funding agencies.  If we are truly to become equal, we must alleviate the barriers that cause the fragmentation of opporutnity and success. Educators want the opporutnity to teach and have the necessary materials and support to do so.  Administrators want the same.  The educators and students make the best out of what is given to them.  If limited resources are available and offered, how can we expect teachers and students to excel.  Policy makers and politians must make an effort to walk in another's shoes.  Making the educational needs of all of our student's a priority must be at the front of the list.  These are future Americans.  The pride and ownership that we instill and facilitate in our young Americans will carry us on for years to come.+books
Shallow and depressing+N+I got this book because I enjoy good literature and the reviews were decent. I know some people say this writer is gifted, but I don't see it. I thought it was a pretentious, depressing piece of crap. The characters were full of self-loathing and the "bright ending" didn't redeem anything, not the main character or the book+books
G - Mac from Alabama+P+I read this book some time ago. It is one of the most fascinating books I've ever read. Eric Haney is one of the most fascinating people I've ever met. A very confident but unassuming person, that once you meet you realize he has no need to embellish his life's in Delta story with accounts based in fantasy.  Eric Haney is the real deal and a genuine person. Eric is a true leader and a brilliant man.  I am absolutely appalled at some of the claims made about Eric being less than honest in his book. What a shame that such a good American has to be trodden over by cheap and meaningless gossip. Jealousy is a terrible thing.  By the way, I believe much of the gossip is fueled by Eric Haney's comments about the Iraq war being a debacle. You simply can't go unscathed when you refuse to worship at the foot of the golden calf of the George W. Bush Iraq War.  Great book!!! Great American!!!  Gary McClaran B'ham, A+books
Horribly muddled+N+This is one of the most horribly muddled "thrillers" I've ever read.  By the end, I wasn't sure who was "winning" or "losing," nor did I really care.  Clive better quit sub-contracting out his writing.  He should dump this cast of characters and concentrate on Dirk Pitt. +books
strong stories; read by a fantastic actor (Paul Winfield)+P+These stories, as read by the great actor Paul Winfield, are powerful testaments to life, love, hard times, etc..  These stories and their central character, Socrates Fortlow, are fine examples of a man, who did wrong, seeks redemption, and tries hard to make amends.  The continuing theme of the crime which he committed ties them all together.  Mr. Winfield's reading cuts across all racial barriers, to teach all of us, black and white, about one man's struggle(s) with his demons.  His reading also adds passion and depth to Mr. Mosley's writing.  I'd highly recommend these stories (in audio and print).  [Refers to the audio edition.+books
WELL WRITTEN BLATHER+N+Although well written, this book is just left wing socialist blather. Most egregiously in error is the author's characterization of Catholic social teaching. He wuld have us believe that the Catholic Church is all behind the US social welfare system. Just one quote summarizes where the Catholic Church really is on this issue:   "In recent years the range of such intervention has vastly expanded, to the point of creating a new type of state, the so-called "Welfare State." This has happened in some countries in order to respond better to many needs and demands, by remedying forms of poverty and deprivation unworthy of the human person. However, excesses and abuses, especially in recent years, have provoked very harsh criticisms of the Welfare State, dubbed the "Social Assistance State." Malfunctions and defects in the Social Assistance State are the result of an inadequate understanding of the tasks proper to the State. Here again the principle of subsidiarity must be respected: a community of a higher order should not interfere in the internal life of a community of a lower order, depriving the latter of its functions, but rather should support it in case of need and help to coordinate its activity with the activities of the rest of society, always with a view to the common good. By intervening directly and depriving society of its responsibility, the Social Assistance State leads to a loss of human energies and an inordinate increase of public agencies, which are dominated more by bureaucratic ways of thinking than by concern for serving their clients, and which are accompanied by an enormous increase in spending. In fact, it would appear that needs are best understood and satisfied by people who are closest to them and who act as neighbors to those in need. It should be added that certain kinds of demands often call for a response which is not simply material but which is capable of perceiving the deeper human need. One thinks of the condition of refugees, immigrants, the elderly, the sick, and all those in circumstances which call for assistance, such as drug abusers: all these people can be helped effectively only by those who offer them genuine fraternal support, in addition to the necessary care." (Pope John Paul II, Centessimus Annus, 1991)     I could give you a quote for every other case where the author misrepresents Church teaching. The author assumes that poor people are poor because others have too much. This assumption is NOT shared by the Catholic Church. I am a conservative largely because of Catholic social teaching. +books
Not badly written, but ultimately preposterous+N+Toward the end of this novel, the lead character, Reichs' usual heroine Tempe Brennan, remarks on the "remarkable coincidence" of one of the plot points. By this point in the book, this is like pointing out to a rabid dog that it's got some spittle on its chin.  This book relies on coincidence so fundamentally that if it were removed, it would fall into 3 or 4 different books with little or nothing to do with one another.  Reichs is not a bad writer, and for someone who so clearly comes from a forensic background, is passably adept at character, plot and scene setting. She knows how to build suspense and intrigue, and never lets the technicalities of her lead character's profession -- a forensic anthropologist -- or the intricacies of her work, undermine the story.  This book centres on Brennan's investigation of a religious cult that perpetrates a set of murders. There are lots of interesting points about how cults work, ritual murder and even large group awareness programs get in on the action. And, of course, several forensic investigations where we are treated to the processes of digging up bones, collecting maggots and bugs, and examining various grim bits of the human body.  What undermines this book is that the first half is at least three different, unrelated stories; and the second is such a clumsy and outrageous merging of them into one, that one drifts from disinterest to incredulity. The jacket cover says this book is about the excavation of a 19th century nun's bones, and the mysteries therewith. In fact, this is just story number 1, which is of only tangential importance to the ultimate, main storyline.  It is not obvious, even in terms of the world of Death du Jour, why Reichs needed all this intermingling. It feels like she started writing a travel journal, then stuck a murder into each of her ports of call, then simply declared that they all belong to the same overarching plot. In this context, each individual story feels derivative, and the grand plot feels like a desperate trick.  A well-written and, at times, interesting book, which is ultimately unsatisfying and preposterous+books
Huh?+N+Although an interesting read, it sure as hell wasn't worth the price! This little book should have donated as a side dish. I guess you could say we got screwed, Jack!  I can hear Hunter laughing in hell right now...+books
Unless revised, checked and almost completely rewritten, this book will remain a one star book!+N+I  bought this book because I saw it in the bargain bin at WH Smith for 99p. I hate a lot of things, I hate stamps, I hate fanboys, I even hate fanboys who collect stamps! But none of those can compare to the hatred I have for this book and my curiosity to read it! I honestly don't know where to start; there are certain FACTS which he has tried to work his way around or completely dodge. FOr instance, the videogame Killer7, he claims it has a full blown on sex scene, however I have played this and there is nothing over PG rated! He also mentions criticising the ESRB without offering any proof for what he says! The same could be said for grammar and spelling, it was completely atrocious, it is unforgivable that he is a lawyer and I believe a 16 year old could do better! What I found worse about him is the fact he gives out false threats, he threatened Rockstar Games to pull their GTA games from the shelves or he would bring a law suit to them... nothing happened! The last thing I would like to say about the book is he leaves out the negative things about him such as offering to donate $10,000 to charity if someone were to make a game of a father killing video game designers. About two or three of these games appeared on the internet and he refused to help charities. In the long run, I believe that the perception of Jack Thompson has gone bad to worse after releasing this book.  A very poor and very sloppy read. Save your money, as for my copy? [...+books
Captain+N+Utter Disappointment, I wish I had never purchased this book.  However, it will cure any insomnia you may have.  Check out something else+books
Utterly overrated+N+I found the characters to be mostly caricatures; there's no sense that any of them are actual human beings. As a result, there's no change -they're static, and whatever changes they supposedly go through feel completely unbelievable. And while much of the book focuses on how different classes don't truly see each other, Forster commits that same sin himself by ignoring the poorest family in the book, the Basts. Instead of making them seem real, he reduces them to mere plot devices.  In addition, Forster, a product of his time, is given to making sweeping pronouncements about the human race. Again, if he intended some irony here (as, for example, Jane Austen, who was so good at shading her prose with those kinds of hints), I'd think better of this book. Novels typically rely on either a solid plot (i.e., the stuff that's happening) or on solid characters (i.e., the stuff that happens in people's inner lives) or both to carry the reader through. I found neither here. At the very least I would like to feel the author's genuine love of language; I can forgive a bad book if it's exceptionally written. I didn't find that kind of prose here. You can skip a good third of the pages and lose nothing+books
Emotions, Soul, and Heart Combine to Make a Person Whole.+N+This is a continuation of The Mind of The Soul by this pair and The Seat of the Soul by Mr. Zukav.  He has published three others about the soul, yet he is not a psychologist or specialist in this field.  This is an extremely simplified textbook which found its way to the library sale.  The bold-faced "highlighted" parts throughout are distracting.  From some of the diagams, these ideas:  "The early antidote for painful emotions is Love and Trust" (combined), "You continually encounter what your soul wants you to encounter.  When you resist your encounters, you resist the purpose of your life, the beneficience of the Universe, non-physical assistance.  That resistance is your pain," and "Stress is your indication you are resisting your experience in the present moment.  When you resist your emotions, you create stress."  Your emotions are the force field of your soul.  Each emotion is a message for you, a signal from your soul.  When you are aware of everything you are feeling all the time (emotional awareness), you are in continual communication with your soul.  This book is a lot of wishful thinking.  They are a good-looking couple, but hardly qualified to influence educated persons about how to handle emotions or reach deep down to find one's soul.  That is a spiritual thing+books
Woeful+N+I have been reading Cornwell for about a decade now and in the 1990's I thought of her as one of the very best of the best writers out there. Her first 5 or 6 novels were tremendous but since then she has slowly tapered off into mediocrity and this book - Trace - represents an all-time low.  The thing that got me was the level of the writing, it just seemed so flat and lifeless. I found it repetitive in the first chapter when Scarpetta is saying to herself that "she should have been told....". It just seemed so ordinary, almost as if someone else was writing this book and not a talented novelist like Cornwell.+books
Fiddling with the classics+N+As an old Bostonian and Cape Codder I bought this book for the sumptious cover photograph.  Sadly Ms Broder suffers from the common cookbook author disease of clever fiddling with classic recipes.  New England Boiled Dinner with stout, brown sugar and molasses!  Made a sickly sweet mess. And my favorite, Fried Clams, made with Japanese Panko crumbs! You get the idea.  Photos are great though+books
Don't waste your time!+N+Don't waste your time or money on this book.  It was about as interesting as watching paint dry!  Maybe Danielle Steel should take a break from writing if this is all she can churn out+books
"A dark wind has entered his soul" +P+"Enemies unseen... Fears unspoken...... A dark wind has entered his soul"   Navajo Tribal Police Sgt. Jim Chee seems to be batting zero; so far he has not been able to solve a series of seemingly unrelated crimes. In an area that was joint use land between the Navaho and the Hopi (now Hopi) Sgt Jim Chee is given the task of finding the vandal that keeps destroying a windmill placed there to make Hopi life easer. He hears an airplane landing in the dark of night with no lights. The plane crashes and leaves a dying pilot. Also a dead man sitting up against a rock with a note in his hand saying if you want it back contact...  Sgt Chee is told that it is probably drugs and federal jurisdiction. Chee is not supposed to go anywhere near or have anything to do with the case. He has his own problems with the mill, a missing thief, and a mysterious ritual death. Naturally he listens, and can not help it if they overlap.     One of the reasons for reading Hillerman's books maybe more important than the overlying mystery is the descriptions of the area and the Ways of the Navaho and Hopi. Hillerman suggests you also read "The Book of the Hopi" by Frank Waters.  Not as intricate as the book but still fun is the movie "Dark Wind" (Lou Diamond Phillips as Officer Jim Chee, Fred Ward as Lieutenant Joe Leaphorn+books
Further Evidence of Genius+P+Many years after his more famous work, the Zen master is still very, very, good. In Lila he continues to explore his new metaphysics of value, morals, and quality. Although he definitely stretches in places, there is some very solid work attempting to create a more accurate way of describing the universe and our place in it. It ties very solidly with the modern understanding of quantum physics, and fits with absolute perfection the philosophies of the seminal work "The Structure of Scientific Revolution" by Thomas S. Kuhn. This novel is more straight philosophy than Motorcycle Maintenance, less balanced with an interwoven plot. The plot is there though, and it gives us an even more immediate sense of the author's own precarious mental balance. Many critics call the story bleak and depressing, which may be accurate, but is about as salient as calling Moby Dick a fishing story+books
Just Started+N+I have just started this book and hope I don't have to read too many graphic autopsy reports.   I didn't read The Surgeon but found I didn't have to as this book so far has made numerous references to it.  It seems most of these stories are written by women and always have female M.E.s doing the autopsies+books
a classic through and through+P+this book is really good on many levels.theres really 2 stories going on.1 is how these 3 kids spent thier summer this one time,which is its more endearing side and the other story about this chick that got raped and how a racist town wants to pin it on this black dude.then theres this creepy boo radley guy and all in all its a great book.one of those you have to have read to call yourself educated about literature+books
This "Masterpiece" Should Be Required Reading For "Every" Mormon!+P+I too, having done much research on mormonism over the years as others, had put off reading this "excellent" Expose while doing research on other cultic religions. I finally sat down to read this "Work Of Art" and truly believe it should be "required" reading for every single practicing mormon, but as God gives each and every one of us a "Free Will " of choice, I can only pray that mormons in their "delusionment" will read these reviews and purchase the book for themselves and seek the "Real Truth" in the Word Of God, The Bible! Not only did Fawn Brodie do a wonderful work in her own research of mormonism, but also tied together "masterfully" the research and writings of others on this "Cultic" religion to conclude with a "True" masterpiece in print! With "all" of the thousands of expose's on the writings and actions of this "false prophet" Joseph Smith, I'm truly "amazed" that millions of people continue to embrace and follow this "False" religion! We have many verses, of course, in God's Word that speak to the very "issue" of "Spiritual Blindness"! I find it truly "amazing" and a "paradox" that Joseph Smith went to great lengths in his life to expose the false doctrine of "catholicism" only to "replace" it with his "own" false doctrine! I would "encourage" all mormons to take a look at this book with a truly "open mind" and an "open heart" to the Truth of God's Word in The Bible. We are not "Gods" and will never become "Gods" either in this life or life "after" physical death!+books
everyone get wet+P+the pace was a little slow to beginn but picked up.i couldn't put the book down once it picked up and read it in 1 day.seems everybody got wet at some point and time and the banter was out loud funny and shocking.but when will we stop the short stories and get another book on Sam and Alyssa thats what I hungery for.To pass the time  this will do, pull out the past books on troubleshooters inc to keep up with whos whos+books
A good start with a failed ending...+N+While Conway's idea may have been in the right place, she unfortunatly did not do the required research. I am "Norse Wiccan" but luckily I did not base my Tradition on this book! (I was forwarned before doing so!)  For those interested in building a Wiccan Tradition that is Norse or Germanic based I suggest the following books:   1) Wiccan: Beliefs and Practices by Gary Cantrell    - Not Norse, but a very good Wicca 101 book to serve as      a blueprint.  2) Witchdom of the True by Edred    - Shows how Gardnerian Wicca has its roots in Traditional      Old English "Wiccecraeft" and the Cults of the Vanir from      Scandinavia who worshiped the "Lord and Lady" (Freyr       and Freyja)as there primary deities. YOU HAVE TO READ       THIS BOOK!!! It's availible from Runa Raven Press:       http://www.runaraven.com/  3) Hammer of the Gods by Swain Wodening    - This is a book Anglo-Saxon Heathenism, but if read the      above book, you see why it is nessesary.    4) Germanic Heathenry: A Pratical Guide by James Hjuka Coulter    - This is the ultimate book on Germanic Paganism. A must      read!  5) Northern Mysteries & Magick by Freya Aswynn    - Aswynn is Asatru but with a Wiccan past, so her stuff      tends to be more on the "Vanic" side. Worth a read.    Using the above books, one can build a "Norse Wiccan" Tradition that is based on the historic folk traditions of Norse/Germanic Paganism, instead of the "fluffy bunny" and "New Age" stuff that Conway does with this book, which is basically a reprint of her Celtic Magic book with the names changed to Norse Gods and Goddesses+books
Not even for the airplane+N+If you enjoy a good, tightly plotted thriller -- read something else. This flabby, clunky and completely unbelievable story labors to its silly ending wheezing and gasping like an overweight commuter trying to catch the 8:45.  All of the characters are two dimensional and if you don't figure out the ending hundreds of pages before it arrives you are unconscious.      +books
This book is pathetic+N+I would have given it one star but it deserves two for the last chapter which was quite good. Overall the book in my mind cannot even be compared to Notes From Underground which is a true existential work of art. My bias I believe comes from prefering an existential character to be more intelligent than the average person, not just simply more apathetic such as The Strangers main character. I found the book to be very boring. This is just my opinion, and many people find the book great and I have no quarrel with that+books
The first 2 lines reek of the english department+P+The first 2 lines are: "What makes Iago evil? some people ask. I never ask." Which also reeks of facile gum-snapping cynicism.  But Joan really redeemed herself with the following passage: "She walked back to the car and sat for a long while in the parking lot, idling the engine and watching a woman in a muumuu walk out of the Carolina Pines motel and cross the street to a supermarket. The woman walked in small mincing steps and kept raising her hand to shield her eyes from the vacant sunlight. As if in trance Maria watched the woman, for it seemed to her then that she was watching the dead still center of the world, the quintessential intersection of nothing."  +books
Good stuff!+P+Quammen has compiled a thoughtful and entertaining collection of his essays for THE BOILERPLATE RHINO.  You don't need to be a nature buff or of a scientific mind to enjoy what he's written.  This was a bit of an impulse buy due to a bargain price, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I look forward to reading more of Quammen's work+books
Enjoyable by young and old alike!+P+The earth is surrounded by a sinister presence - a dark, foul fog that is the tool of an ultimate evil - whose ambition is to enslave the planet with the complete removal of free will. Three magical beings, Mrs Whatsit, Mrs Who and Mrs Which - witches, angels, demigods perhaps - appear to Margaret and Charles Wallace Murry and their friend, Calvin O'Keefe, to persuade them that it is their destiny to battle this evil on its own turf and to rescue Margaret and Charles Wallace's father. Dr Murry has been missing for some months and the kids learn that he has been captured by the evil while he was "tessering", traveling time and space in the course of his scientific research.  While the writing is straightforward, well crafted and obviously aimed at a younger audience, "A Wrinkle in Time" is nonetheless a fast paced enjoyable tale of good vs evil that combines elements of science fiction, fantasy and magic even adult readers will flip through relentlessly. But there are lots of life lessons, issues and moral themes sprinkled throughout - low hanging fruit just waiting for the eager child, the observant questioning teen, the confused parent or thinking adult to pick and chew on, as it were - the coming of age realization that parents are not infallible; the cruelty of malicious gossip; God and evil; the awkwardness of romantic adolescent relationships; the potential destructiveness of pride or vanity; the marginalizing of people who are different; the enormous difficulties of selflessness; the understanding that all life's questions will not be answered; and more.  While some readers criticize "A Wrinkle in Time" as being overtly moralist, I felt somewhat differently. It was clear to me that religion and, in particular, Christian symbolism was present but I felt that L'Engle let it sit quietly just beneath the surface and the story never became even remotely preachy.  It is little wonder that "A Wrinkle in Time" has been elevated to the status of children's classic and continues to be enjoyed by adults and children alike more than 40 years after it was first published for a grateful reading world.

Marxist Propaganda+N+This book is written by an avowed Marxist, and as such, neglects to mention the horrors of Soviet Russia.  Not only that, Ol' Eric discusses how horrible capitalism is, even though it was only because of capitalism that he was able to publish this waste of paper.  He does not spend much time at all on World War II, and has the gall to called Richard Nixon a horrible president (which he was) without heaping abuse upon Stalin or any other Communists.  The book also glosses over most historical events and goes for the "Big Picture" of history.  I hated this book.  Until I read it, I actually enjoyed learning about history.  Now I am not so sure+books
Knocked-up Ebony Mamas+N+Wittgenstein said that the purpose of a popularization is to make people think they understand something they don't understand.  What seems to be a common current of science popularizations is that they "explain" things in such a simplified way that the reader who actually wants to get down to brass tacks is completely mystified.    Einstein's book on relativity is a case in point, as is this book in which the candid reader is informed that "Objects at rest tend to remain at rest, therefore heavier objects will fall faster in a gravitational field."  Got that?  If so, maybe you can explain it to me.  Listen, I know something about Physics.  Back in the seventies I built a particle accelerator out of a blow drier and a box of Mike and Ikes. +books

mind opener+P+I first read this book shortly after it was published and it was one that started me on a journey of discovery about natural selection and sexual selection. From being someone who was more focussed on social sciences at last I had discovered a more scientific way of understanding the world that made much more sense. The natural world, human societies and my own family relationships began to connect in a more comprehensible whole.  So the best parts of the book for me are those about natural selection and Family Values rather than the workings of the human mind, though these sections are also a very good read.  Having read widely since, I know there is far more that needs to be understood. Particularly with sexual selection there are a lot of women, like myself, who are aware that female sexuality throughout the animal kingdom is more complex than has been thought with female promiscuity far more prevalent than would be expected with the assumption that a female only needs to mate with one male.  Also, with human females having concealed ovulation a man could mate with vast numbers of females and never have a single offspring whereas it is the female who needs to be mating a lot when she is ovulating - and not necessarily with only one male.  It is only humans that have females producing all their offspring from a single father - in other species, though a male may have exclusive access to a number of females it is never for life and he will be replaced or the female will move to another male.  Pinker does make clear points about human males owning daughters, sisters and wives and enforcing monogamy on them, which naturally overrides female mate choice. He is not offensive in the way some male writers are when they write as if females are naturally passive and monogamous while males gleefully exploit one female after another.  In this book Pinker writes better about the sexes than he does in 'The Blank Slate' when he writes about rape.  Though I now know enough to be able to question points in this book, I still think it is an excellent read and would recommend it to anyone and everyone.+books
Silly!+N+Great cover, enticing premise. I couldn't wait to read this book...BUT... Every one-star review before mine lays my feelings out perfectly. Let me add a couple more. Frannie grows up, decides to live with a man and writes home to tell her mother what she's going to do. What does her mother say? That's nice, dear. I trust you to make the right decision. Oh please!!! This is the 19th century after all! Then for good measure let's throw this one into the mix. After the indomitable Una shows understanding and makes decisions that earn her the admiration and accolades of every living person, famous or not, that she comes into contact with...she decides to buy into an oil well to help a friend even though everyone agrees that this is throwing money down the rat hole. An oil well! You must be kidding! Of course, she eventually recoups her money plus a bunch.  I could go on and on. I finished every page of this book although I must say I skimmed through the last 100 pages. When I finished and my husband asked how it was, the only way I could think to describe it was SILLY+books
Not worth the money+N+I own a strategy guide for every Final Fantasy game, and this one was sorely disappointing.  I think the only guide that has been worse than this is the FF9 'PlayOnline' joke (that no longer exists online).  The strategy guide leaves out several key elements of the game (such as how to find Aeris' limit break BEFORE disc 2), how you can reach certain areas, where to find items, who to have in your party in certain areas, etc.  The information was blatantly inaccurate or extremely confusing.  Some of the maps are mislabeled and look more like a random assortment of screenshots than a coherent guide.  All in all, don't waste your money on this guide.  You're better off buying the Brady version instead+books
Wal-Mart is a big lovely bundle of sunshine+N+I guess I'd better confess right away: I didn't finish this book. I only made it a third of the way before I was too disgusted to finish it. I'm sure there are many useful things I could learn if I could choke it all down, but it was very difficult.   I don't think it helped that I just finished The Case Against Wal-Mart by Al Norman.  I think it's great that Wal-Mart was able to bring goods to smaller towns that really didn't have access to a department store or discount retailer, but I can't get over the desruction of American businesses, American jobs and the terrible wages and benefits for American workers (not to mention all the foreign workers who produce Wal-Mart goods) that have become standard operating procedure. Lower costs at any cost is not a responsible way to run a business, and while I agree that Soderquist did a great job at making himself rich and the company successful, I think the damage is costly+books
Outdated---Ancient History+N+Exiled Cubans in Miami up to 1987. This is real old stuff. I wonder why this book is still being published. Felt like a collection of shorter magazine--newspaper articles compiled to look like a real book. Many long, disjointed sentences. Could use an updating. There must be better books out there about this topic+books
Ponzi+P+Written like a novel, this is the true story of Charles Ponzi, the most famous con man using the "rob-Peter-to-pay-Paul" scam. I found the book to be entertaining without a dull spot. After several unsuccessful cons, he started with a small stake and took people's money and paid them 50% in 45 days. When other people heard, the number of investors mushroomed. He finally made about $8,000,000 (in the 1920's) in this pyramid scheme before he was caught+books
Auobiographical, but still a good story!+P+This book is a devastating expose of the treatment of children in nineteenth century England.  This book written by Charles Dickens is probably one of his better known works.  It has always been thought that the book is autobiographical, but it tells a really good story too, as all of Dickens' works do.  I love Dickens novels for the characters and this one does not disappoint.  We have David Copperfield himself who is the orphaned hero-narrator, and his mother Clara Copperfield and his cruel step father Edward Mardstone.  We've also got friends of David's - Clara, Daniel, Ham and Little Em'ly Peggotty, plus a whole bunch of other wonderful characters.  It's a coming of age novel for a boy of the nineteenth century, and Dickens covers all the pain and joy that goes along with growing up poor in England at this time.  We see David grow up and get married.  We see his pain as he watches his invalid wife sicken and die and his ultimate success as a writer.   Don't miss Charles Dickens' great works in your reading adventures.  I've read every one+books
The Best Picoult So Far+N+Every book by Jodi Picoult grabs you by the heart and doesn't let go. Mercy stands out from all the rest. You will not forget this book or the people in it for a long time+books
Beautiful, thought-provoking and utterly magical+P+I recently discovered Sugimoto's pictures browsing the web.  This book is beautifully produced and plate after plate demands not only an aesthetic response from the viewer but also a decidedly intellectual and conceptual one (maybe that's the same thing!).  It's rare to find art that is simultaneously so beautiful and so profound+books
Leave reality at the door+P+This is not a typical read for me, but I enjoyed it.  I read the first 148 pages wondering if this was going to be a waste of time, but when I hit chapter 44, I read the rest of the book in one sitting.  Loved Max, Frannie, Kit & all the others.  Looking forward to reading "The Lake House"+books
What It All Means.....+P+As David Catrow tells us in his introduction, "...For me, the Constitution is a kind of how-to book, showing us ways to have happiness, safety, and comfort...", and he uses his immeasurable talents as an artist and cartoonist to teach an inspirational and unforgettable lesson that is sure to open interesting discussions at home and school.  Following a glossary of what the actual words in the Preamble of the Constitution mean, (e.g. "IN ORDER TO FORM A MORE PERFECT UNION:  To come together and make things better for everyone who lives in our country.  INSURE DOMESTIC TRANQUILITY:  To make sure we can all have a nice life and get along with one another.  TO OURSELVES AND OUR POSTERITY:  For kids, parents, other grown-ups, and all the people born in our country after we are."), Mr Catrow details the meaning of these important ideals, phrase by phrase, using his marvelously bold and busy cartoon illustrations.  Each two page spread is a clever feast for the eyes, rich in engaging details, manic energy, and droll humor.  Perfect for youngsters 8-12, We The Kids is a witty and memorable treasure, and one of the real winners of 2002 that shouldn't be missed+books
information, not judgement+P+if your interested in a healthy diet, of any type, this book is a MUST.  for those already or considering vegetarianism, i have not yet found anything that compares.  this book focuses on the "How to be healthy" and leaves preaching (in things one may or may not agree with) aside, so it is an awesome source for everyone.  omnivores and veggie/vegans (health, AR, environmentalist or any mix) will feel comfortable reading and reaping the benefits from this book.  in depth but easy to understand explanations of basic dietary needs, info from many studies, and how to make the most of this info in one's everyday eating habits.  it takes time to explain the macronutrients (to include protein requirements and essential amino acid intake), individual minerals and vitamins, essential fatty acids and more.  a book that i'm extremely pleased to have come across and to have in my library+books
Not worth it+N+This was the first book by Daniel Steel that I laid my hands on....Really could not make out how she strikes the chord with the readers. There are so many open ends in the story...chartacters are not distinctly outlined...Tremendous scope of improvement on the story is there+books
Missed the mark+N+I am a Nevada Barr fan and was unfortunately disappointed with "High Country."  The story takes place in a restaurant (boring). The characters were dull and I kept getting them confused. Anna's constant thinking of how old she feels is tiresome. I also missed Anna's sister, Molly, who is only mentioned a few times in the book.   Sorry, but I really can't recommend this book as a good read. If you want to get a feel for a real Anna Pigeon adventure, pick up "Track of the Cat" or "Liberty Falling.+books

An American Essential+P+For a buck you can certainly toss this in with whatever else you're  ordering this trip. RWE is one of the great articulators of the American  mind. For better or worse, here's a distilled vision of what we think.   RWE's positive and powerful view of human thought can be uplifting, though  some may occasionally experience a desire to snort &quot;Oh,  puh-lease!&quot;   A great source of pithy quotes and sharp insights, RWE  also provides considerable depth if you wade all the way into his works.  Everyone should have some collection of Emerson on the shelf, and this  collection hits all the high points (though it is not, it should be said, a  good choice for those suffering from chronic eyestrain)+books
Trite, Boring & Disingenuous+N+While I enjoy Greenberg's radio show, I was extremely disappointed in this book.  Throughout the book, Greenberg relays the same banal stories he repeats ad nauseum on the radio.  Unfortunately, unlike on the radio, when Mike Golic is always available to slap some sense into Greenberg, this book is purely 100% Greenberg.  I am always amazed by those people who have lived extremely privileged lives, yet try to act like they have "struggled" in life.  Greenberg has had to "struggle" thru a cushy upbringing, going to exclusive schools such as Northwestern and eventually landing his gig at ESPN.  For those of you in the Chicago area, I hope that you caught Debra Pickett's article on Greenberg in the Chicago Sun-Times.  While Greenberg professes to be a family man, the article notes how he spent 2-1/2 hours talking about his favorite topic, himself, while forgoing the opportunity to meet his wife and children at the pool.  Keeping with his privileged existence, the pool was located at the East Bank Club in Chicago, yet another privileged club to which Greenberg belongs.  I should receive a refund for slopping thru this "book."  Hopefully, this review will prevent other people from making the mistake I did.  ESPN should fire this wimpy "meterosexual" for writing this book. +books
A summer's vacation for sure!+N+Roberts' The Pengin History of Europe contains detailed information of European history.  Beginning with the Stone Age ending in the 20th century.  Europes' influence on government, economics, and religion are covered in detail.  Greek, Roman, Asian, Italian, Germans, Russian, and even American history have been influenced by Europes will and power. If you are a historian or history professor, Roberts' discussions will have you yearning for more.  For us less scholarly students, it is a reader's nightmare+books
Proof Publishers and Editors Need Economic Training+N+Three facts about economists teaching laypeople:  1: Economists love to be counter-intuitive. 2: Economists love to be controversial. 3: Economists love to go on about their personal opinions as though they were fact because, after the above two points, no one feels he or she can defend any contradicting opinion  This book suffers from the worst of these points. Yes, economics is sometimes quite the opposite of what one might think and is very often "politically inviable" because of its conclusions, but Mr. Landsburg goes far too much into the rhelm of "I'm the author, you have to do what I say." I, too, agree that, for example, enviromental policies are often extremely ineffecient. However, if these policies are important to others, if they bring happiness or, in other words, "utility" to a degree greater than the opportunity costs incured, that's their business. The book is scattered with his belittlement of the poor idiots who don't understand economics and if they did they would think like him.   This is the sort of reason why people don't like econmists. This is why people think we're heartless prigs. If the people through whom this book must have gone before it was published knew enough about economics to defend their positions instead of just accepting the author as their better, they would have perhaps reminded him to tone down some of his particulars that he forms into generalities.   To summize: Mr. Landsburg is an insufferable know-it-all, who does, in all fairness, know-it-some+books

I was repulsed by his refusal to chastise his pedophile companion!+N+I was enjoying the travel parts of the book, despite numerous detours of self-serving/indulgent behavior by Mr. Crichton,until I reached the part where he was in Bangkok. He teams up with a journalist for a night on the town. His journalist friend suggests they go to one of the area's many brothels. Finally,  after testing the waters, the journalist excitedly drops his bombshell and  suggests a child whorehouse. Crichton doesn't dare to tell his companion what a loathsome creep he is or that he finds the suggestion repulsive and wants nothing more to do with him. Instead,he goes and checks the place out. He gives a description of tarted up six-year-old girls posing provocatively and being kept in line by geriatric prostitutes. Perhaps I'm just a prude but it seems to me that any normal decent young man would find the idea of sex with tots and grannies vile. I didn't expect Crichton to actually put a stop to all of this but he could have perhaps told the sickie to get some professional help or at least told him that kiddie sex wasn't his thing, instead he makes up some whiny complaint about a stomach ache and tells the guy to go ahead without him. This infuriated me and turned my stomach. I threw the book in the trash. I wish publishers had done the same. FYI, there is no zero star option+books
Laugh at yourself - then understand!+P+This book was recommended to us by a psychotherapist when we came to discuss family problems.  It was a great help through the first few weeks of therapy - and progress followed rapidly. Psychoanalysis never had such a coherent explanation!And the voice of John Cleese makes a great delivery for the info.  Bravo+books
Gripping story of survival+P+London is a tremendously talented writer and his understanding of life matches his tremendous knowledge of the snow-enshrouded world of the upper latitudes.  His writing is beautiful, poignant, and powerful, yet also somber, morose, and infinitely real. This isn't a story to read when you are depressed. Although The Call of the Wild is a short novel and on the surface a dog's story, it contains as much truth and reality of man's own struggles as that which can be sifted from the life's work of many other respected authors. The story he tells is stark and real, and as such, it is not pretty picture he paints, nor an elevating story he writes.   As an animal lover, I found parts of this story heartbreaking from Buck's removal from the civilized Southland in which he reigned supreme among his animal kin to the brutal cold and even more brutal machinations of hard, weathered men who literally beat him and whipped him full of lashes. Even sadder are the stories of the dogs that fill the sled's traces around him. Good-spirited Curly never had a chance, while Dave's story is only made bearable because of his brave, undying spirit. Even Spitz, the harsh taskmaster, has to be pitied, despite his harsh nature, for the reader knows this harsh nature was forced upon him by man and his thirst for riches.   Buck's travails are long and hard, but it is his nobility of his spirit that makes of him a hero, despite the primitive animal instincts and urges that dominate him. Buck not only conquers the weather, the harshness of the men, the other dogs and the wolves he comes into contact with,  he thrives. Hopes for redemption with John Thornton are dashed in the end, and that's when Buck finally gives in fully to "the call of the wild," becoming a creature of nature only. While this is a sad ending, the reader also feels joy and satisfaction at Buck's refusal to surrender and his ability to find his own kind of happiness in the harsh world in which he is placed+books

Huge Disappointment+N+I was hoping this book would be a collection of monologues for women from plays that directors might have heard of! It appears they are written by the author and most are not appropriate for a serious audition. Feel like I wasted my money here.+books
Great reads ruined by horrible characters+N+The other reviewers will tell you about the book.  I've read most of Preston and Child's works, including the other two books in this trilogy, and they are a good read.  What gets very old and nauseating is the continual saps to modern feminism.  I guess it's a necessity to get published today, but you'd think that at least SOME male authors would get tired of grovelling just to get published.  I guess most people will sell their souls for money.  Just about all the men in P and L's books are either wimps, effiminate, weak, bumbling, stupid (or liars or murderers), cry-babies, scared of their own shadows, and thoroughly unlikable (even Pendergast has his moments).  The women, of course, are, without exception, tough, brilliant, shrewd, fearless, always right, on the rise to the top, always outsmarting the men, able to knock out a 7 foot, 300 pound man with a single karate chop to the neck (forgive the slight hyperbole), totally unfeminine, and just as unlikeable as the men.  The stories are very good; it's unfortunate Preston and Child couldn't have come up with better, more realisticly human, less insulting characters.  This slop may play in New York and California, but in Texas we still want our men to be men and our women to be women.  So this is just a warning.  If you're a MAN--and those of you who are know what I mean--you'll get sick of the characters in these books. +books
Unbelievable+N+I have read every one of Stephen King's books.  This was the only one that I have not read.  I have struggled to get to page 105 and I have no clue as to what is going one.  The style of Peter Straub stinks.  Don't waste your money, you will put this book back on the shelf an never have a clue as to what the story is about.  Stephen King has finally written a real clunker.  This may be the worst book that I have ever tried to read+books
A point of view ...+P+When I was born in 1945, my mother, a German armed forces helper on the way from Prague (deep South) up to an isle named "Ruegen" (in the very North), in the middle of her long journey through a breaking down Germany: she came down with me and, after one day in hospital, she stuffed me away into a children's home (in a town called "Wuppertal", West-Germany) - and left me to my fate. So she robbed me (among others) the experience of a childhood in the GDR, German Democratic Republic, "Wuppertal" should be "West-Germany" (American sector), the isle of Ruegen became Russian sector, behind the "Iron Curtain". So I did not learn anything about "Young Pioneer meetings", socialism, communism, STASI (the secret police) or summer camps of young "Pioneers". In the Western hemisphere I grew up, drinking Pepsi Coke, receiving American Care packages, later on: listened to the Beatles, noticed the students movement in 1968, had no Ulbrich or Honecker, but chancellor Willy Brandt and Helmut Kohl. But I tried to find out the place, where the woman could live, who had born me in that dark year 1945. After 40 years of persistent search, 1985, before the Berlin Wall fell (1989), I found out: She was living behind the "Iron Curtain" on the isle of Ruegen. And I started to look at this lost childhood, which I did not enjoy: She showed me her photo album: summer beach near "Kap Arkona" at the north-point of the isle, snowy winters on Hiddensee, flight ducks, cranes - but on the other hand coal heaps on washed-out sidewalks. Color films (Orwo), books, Trabi substitute parts: only hard to get. Nevertheless, I wanted to make up for my life in the GDR - in 1990 when the Berlin Wall was fallen: A schools inspector on the island pointed into a corridor, filled with former Stasi employees (security police) and informed me in this manner in an almost dumb "cadre conversation", he unfortunately (thanks to the "reunification" of East and West-Germany) would have to hide many people in the teaching profession now (in hastiest kind). I should return please to West-Germany, where I just had come from. The direction of my journey seemed to be absolutely atypically, out of character, and not recommendable. No "Ossi" (vs. "Wessi") - no job. As a result my mother, noticing, that all her dreams collapsed, joined an acute epidemic disease at that time: She committed a so-called balance sheets suicide. I was deprived of the chance to become a "zone child" a second time. Did I miss really much? Because the book of Jana Hensel has stimulated me to these thoughts - maybe her sometimes nostalgic "Ossi" writings (of course very different to my "Wessi"-point of view) are not as superficial, simple, banal, as I thought in the first moment? Compare her point of view ..+books
A good book for those who are gifted or their parents+P+Being gifted doesn't mean you know everything and have figured everything out.  It just means you're brighter than the average bear and can leap to conclusions and see connections faster than others.  You also remember better and thus cannot stand things being repeated over and over.  Unfortunately, because society is designed for those who are less bright, this causes problems for the gifted.  This book explores what those problems are.  Both while growing up and as adults.  A very enlightening book and one I recommend to those who are gifted or who are parents of gifted children/adults+books
Don't Judge This Book By Its Cover!+P+I'd seen the movie "Valley of the Dolls," whose characters are pictured on the cover of this book, but only recently did I read Jacqueline Susann's magnum opus.  What a pleasant surprise! This engaging novel, despite its length, is a fast read.  It is better -- far better -- than the film. (The movie, however, is a "must see" for its over-the-top acting, 60's fashions and "so bad it's good" storyline.)    Although initially billed (to great effect) as a steamy romance novel, the book is much more substantive.  Each of the characters is well-developed, and each has human flaws that lead to her success or spell her undoing.  Before it was fashionable, Susann used the character of Anne Welles to explore one woman's attempt to ignore the pressures to marry early and instead devote herself to a career.  Susann examined the problem of the abuse of legal drugs at a time when it was seen as primarily a teenage phenomenon.  Neely O'Hara is initially a sympathetic character, but has enough of the "bitter greens" (envy, jealousy and bile) which, when added to an insatiable ego and a large quantity of pills, leads to  her rise and fall.  And Jennifer North knows what she has and knows its advantages -- and limitations.  These characters are real, and one need not be in show business to know them.  Although written in 1966 (with a story that begins in 1945), the plotline is not dated.  Neither is the message: Susann asks whether having everything you ever wanted really is the key to happiness.  There is a reason why this book has remained a bestseller and continues to enthrall a new generation of readers. +books
Unbiblical and bad writing make for one star+N+This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck+books
Succeeds as a book, Fails as a social stimulator+P+One only need read the reviews of this book from both professional and amateur critics to see that, if Gross's purpose is to aid the reconciliation between Jews and Poles, he has utterly failed. Unlike books dealing with heroes who surmounted prejudice to create miracles, this book stirs an old cauldron of hatred, freshening the pot. Readers without a more complete history of both the Jews and the Poles are especially at risk. Jan Karski's "Story of a Secret State" which was actually written DURING World War 2 and deals with  the situation in a balanced and informed manner would be a good companion book to this.  Additional reading should include a comprehensive review of Polish-Jewish relations, beginning with the Charters of Sanctity responsible for so many Jews living in Poland in the first place. When Jews were being blamed for the plague and slaughtered throughout Europe, the Poles opened their doors and gave them a homeland, where they thrived for many centuries.  The Lutheran armies of the Swedish invasions brought anti-Semitism. Later, Poland was divided by Germany, Russia (with a German Queen), and Austria, an occupation which lasted for more than a century. These countries waged a cultural war on the occupied Poles, determined to convert them to their own.   The Poland of WW2 had only been liberated for a few decades. The equivalent of Ronald Reagan's era to today. Many of the citizens were of German descent and actually aided the Nazis in their fight against other Poles, not only Jews.  And although the sickening atrocities recounted in this book are inexcusable, one must keep in mind that they were committed by people driven to collective madness by decades of oppression, poverty and terror. We've seen similar episodes in recent years in the Balkans and Africa and elsewhere. Even the Israeli human rights organization B'Tselem maintains a website decrying violations by hate-infected Israelis today.  Poland has only regained her true national and cultural identity in the last two decades, after two hundred years of occupation. Pope John Paul 2 was emblematic of that spirit, and Poland's support for Israel and attempts to honor her Jewish heritage, embraced by her youth of today, are evidence that she has turned a corner and is nurturing the great ideals of her past. The Poland that was once a mighty power, yet never imperialistic. The Poland that was the Promised Land for Jews in the Middle Ages+books
As Important Today As When It Was Written+P+I read this book last year.  I was born during the Vietnam war and remember little about it.  I certainly did not experience the build up before the war.  The Ugly American had a tremendous influence on American foreign policy back then.  It highlighted our arrogance and our vulnerabilities when we forget the importance of understanding other cultures.  And President Kennedy practically made it mandatory reading for his advisors.  What was most interesting to me, however, was how pertinent the book is today.  Instead of Sarkhan or Vietnam, the book could be about Iraq.  Regardless of your feelings about the war, the Ugly American is enlightening and should remind us how important it is to understand others when we occupy their nation.  The book is a short -- but important -- read.  I recommend it to everyone.  It is a classic not so much because of its language or story.  It's a classic because its message is meaningful even in today's world+books
I really wanted to like this book+N+If Julia Glass had not set the bar so high with Three Junes, I would have given the book 3 stars instead of 2.  There are sentences, paragraphs, even pages of brilliance in this book, but it is as if winning the National Book Award gave Ms. Glass unconditional confidence in her writing, and character development in particular.  She seemed out of touch with the major demographics the narrative slings around.  As another reviewer wrote, the writing process seemed transparant.  Reading the book, you get the feeling that the characters are what Ms. Glass (a privileged white woman of a certain age) imagines teenagers, or New Mexicans, or black chauffeurs, or Hispanic nannies, or even gay people to be like.  She is like a tourist who voyeuristically delights in other cultures without really understanding them.  The teenagers and the Santa Fe inhabitants are the most painful examples of caricatures.  Greenie might be the most believable, and although I understood why she was falling out of love with her gloomy Alan, I wasn't sucked along with her when she falls in love with "the other Charlie".  He was only very mildly interesting and certainly not worth (even temporarily) losing your child over.  With Saga, she manages to develop her most sympathetic character, but Saga's life is left floating and unresolved at the end.  Even the brief appearance of Fenno, who I loved in Three Junes, lacked intensity and seemed gimmicky.  All and all, a very disappointing second novel.  You have to wonder, since most reviewers are pointing out all of the same problems with character, what good is her editor? +books
Unconceivable story, but an amazing piece of literary work!+P+The Partner has quite an outrageous story line, but the way in which Grisham tells the story is absolutely amazing: starting with the climax, Grisham leaves the reader confused and uncertain on his or her feelings for certain characters; as he works backwards telling the story leading up to the climax through events in the present, all the pieces fall into place and the confusing events and feelings in the beginning now make perfect sense.   Yet another great novel from John Grisham+books
Beatrice lives on+P+The book opens with both Beatrice's illegitimate children living together as cousins. John MacAndrew is away trying to get his fortune back after Beatrice stole it all in an effort to keep Wideacre for her children. Julia and Richard early on seem to represent the good and bad Beatrice. Julia resembles Beatrice, and she has her excellent horse riding skills, plus the ability to farm and work the land. All those were "the good Beatrice." Richard only has the insatiable hunger to keep Wideacre for himself and pass it on to his heir. He doesn't care about anything or anybody else. This represents "the bad Beatrice." At the end of Wideacre all Beatrice could think about was raising enough money to secure Wideacre for her heirs, and she turned a blind eye to the poverty and sickness that she was causing. I like how Philippa Gregory weaves historical facts into the story, such as how the poor had to live in order to survive, and how the landowners made such unfair laws, and how they controlled the courts. The parts of the book that were really aggravating to me were the ones where Julia had absolutely no backbone whatsoever.... especially after Richard rapes her. I think Celia and John would definitely have believed her, not Richard.  I have really liked every Philippa Gregory book, whether from the Other Boleyn Girl series or the Wideacre series. I'm looking forward to reading the last book, Meridon. +books
SPECULATIVE FICTION DISGUISED AS ESSAY+N+What trash! What a paranoid book! A true work of tendentious and speculative fiction disguised as an essay.   No wonder that Amazon stands ready to sell this book for $0.35! Even then, it's a quarter and a half wasted. No wonder also that warmongers Paul Wolfowitz and Richard Perle gave it a note of thanks. It reads like their own propaganda in their conspiracy to take over American foreign policy and steer it to Israel's favor.  But the Mylroie-Wolfowitz-Perle cabal DID succeed in having the U.S. attack Iraq. This only shows the tremendous importance of propaganda and the strength of the pro-Israel lobby. Nazi Joseph Goebbels, Hitler's minister of propaganda, would be proud of Laurie Mylroie, since he  once said: "If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it."+books

Flashy book with little actual theoretical/critical content+N+I would like to think of myself as someone who is fairly well informed of the (short) history and theory of video art. As such, I will say this book is a very basic, sort of bland overview of the langauge of video. It's very well put together in terms of it being flashy and "hip"; all the stills are well printed and all the big, "in-vogue" art star names are included (but where are people like Haron Faroqi? Or did he just shoot on film and thus not make the hipster cut?) With that said, there is little to no actual critical content in the writing. It introduces concepts in a very simple way, and doesn't actually end up saying much other than varying degrees of further artist canonization. I don't know maybe I am just too picky and also semi-brainwashed by more rigorous academic books on the topic, but I actually stopped reading the book because it was so boring. If you're looking for a slick coffee table book with which to impress your friends, one that will let them know that you too have joined that cool club called "connoisseurship of video art" and a book that they will tend to thumb through just to look at "all the pretty pictures" (which I find hilariously absurd- a book of still images taken from video), then this book is for you. If you're looking for anything deeper than that, I would look elsewhere to titles like "Illuminating Video : An Essential Guide to Video Art" by David Ross, Doug Hall, Sally Jo Fifer, and David Bolt.+books
Patterson's Second Worst?+N+I rank this book slightly higher than Season of the Machete, simply because I only got to page 25 of that book before giving up on it. I finished this book, but it was hardly an enjoyable read. The one positive is that the chapters are very short, so it feels like the novel moves along at a nice pace. The actual content, however, is very poor. This book is just surviving off the past Cross novels. If someone was just picking up this book having not read any of the prior Cross novels, they are just not going to understand or care about the subplots involving Cross's estranged son, his other two kids, this new love life, etc. I've read all the books leading up to this book, and I barely cared or understood what was going on.   Compare this to Kiss The Girls or Jack and Jill, and it comes up way short. The story and the plot are very thin and very disjointed. Nothing about this book keeps you on the edge of your seat, and you will only feel compelled to finish it if you are a completist. This was by far the worst of the Cross books.+books
Did a six year old write this?+N+This is the first Patterson novel I have ever read, and it is certain to be the last.  Most good authors draw the reader into a story by offering vivid descriptions and in-depth characters, but Patterson does none of that.  The author's writing style is akin to that of a small child's, as he uncermoniously plunks the reader in the middle of boring locales populated with one-dimensional characters.  Patterson then holds the reader's hand as he matter-of-factly recounts the explosion or gunshot du jour and then moves on without explanation, presenting a book written by a Ralph Wiggums-like child for immature children to enjoy.  How does the reader know Alex was scared? The reader knows because Patterson clumsily beats him about the head and shoulders with writing similar to the style: "The man pulled out a gun, Alex was scared, Alex shot the man and he was happy, and the man was dead."  Don't believe me? Simply graze through the book and find where the hero handily dispatches an arch-nemesis in a scene so brief and without fanfare I had to read it twice to make sure the protagonist killed who I thought he killed, or skip to the end if you prefer and painstakingly wind your way through a series of forgettable characters each deadpanning that he or she is responsible for the antagonist's evil deeds.  Quite simply, this author shows a complete lack of imagination and creativity and this book should be avoided at all costs+books
Excellent+P+This book is comprehensive and it has a lot of useful and practical substance.  In addition, the writing is clear and easy to understand.  In this book, the authors show that they really understand what business process/workflow modeling is about+books
NO STUFFED PUPPY HERE+P+Protagonist Donna Trenton sure is in hot water, or should hot weather be more appropriate.  As if being trapped in a dead Pinto with a sick child in the middle of summer while a mean dog surveys the vehicle isn't enough...  But when the mumbo jumbo beast happens to be inflicted with rage on top of that, you can safely say that, besides being toasted in many ways, this lady definitely should have stayed in bed that faithful morning.  But, alas, like in any Stephen King novel, one has to pay the price, and since woman adultery is the case here, poor Donna has a lot to chew on, to say the least.  Writing in a alcoholic stupor (as stated himself) clearly doesn't stop King from delivering an effective read.  Indeed, CUJO is gutso with lots of blood, excitement and canine hair.  Its first half may be in neutral mode with its character development and action setting, but when the gear is shifted, watch out.  Driven to despair has never been more fun in the hand of this Maine man.  Cloned perhaps in its "Jaws" bite, CUJO is nonetheless pure King when it comes to compelling plot.  Just like its Saint-Bernard creature, the author clearly knows how to deliver the goods with drooling edge of your seat moments and in-your face action prose.  Yes, the novel aims for the bubble gum crowd but what a flavorful load of fun this one is--enough to hail it worthy of a sleep-depraved moment award, for sure.  Enjoy.-----Martin Boucher+books
This book is horrible.+N+I just got back from vacation where I read a handful of fun crime dramas. This one really stood out as being horrible from the very first paragraph. The writing is weak and the story was so incredibly thin that that killers were obvious from the start.   I'm not sure who the target audience is for this book, but my best guess is old guys who only read one book a year. There was a really strange mix of detail and inference. It was almost like he needed to fill space so every now and then we would get pointless detail about flying or some other random aspect of what the character was doing. And the sex scenes were just bad.   I really couldn't recommend this book any less+books
Just Plain Dumb...+N+...but that's to be expected since this is, after all, written for the sort of person who is somehow STILL behind the Bush Administration's foreign policy, even after more than four years of it.  Well, this much can be said: At least the author showed some consideration for his true audience by keeping things extremely short and simple.  Simplistic, in fact.  That audience is very easy to recognize--they're the ones, while reading this book-priced magazine article, whose lips are moving+books
Great premise, unfulfilled, but not for lack of pages+N+I read this after enjoying Iles' "Footprints of God" quite a bit.  This is his first work and thank goodness he has since learned to be more concise.  The book is lengthy, and repeats itself quite a bit (due, I assume to the length and complexity of the plot and characters).  Several characters could've been cut out entirely - they were in long enough to kill and be killed, but didn't add anything to the story.  Intriguing characters, too - he could've saved them for their own stories.  After wanting to get to the end for the last 200 pages, I found the ending itself rushed.  All loose ends were wrapped up very conveniently and in ways that didn't pay off for the investment of time required to get that far.  There were some aggravating teases, too.  When the Israeli finally gets to confront the Nazi for the question of "why?" (regarding the anti-semitism), I was really hoping that Iles would've ventured a reply - anything to try and give the Nazi character some depth or plausibility other than just pure hate for the sake of hate.  Nope - he put the question out there and didn't try to answer it.  That's what I was hoping for - replace some of the graphic violence with real explorations of the underlying themes and how this fanaticism really survives - not just giving example after example of how it's manifested.  All that being said, the last page of the epilogue is brilliant, and in it, I found a simple yet profound statement that struck a chord.+books

USS James B. Stockdale, CVN-77+N+We all know Repbulicans don't care much for the environment, and now we're chopping down trees to give more praise to a man whose son's ambition is paid for with American lives. Why was this book written? Are trhe Bush-Kochs suddenly strapped for cash?    The book, if you can focus on a father and daughter that aren't dripping with wealth and power, is good enough. I like GHWB, voted for him, but the lovefest is going way overboard.   And as for the $500 billion dollar aircraft carrier (the tenth and final Nimitz-class supercarrier) just commisioned and named after George, Sr---it was absolutely wrong to do so. The man CVN-77 should have been named after is Admiral James B. Stockdale. Admiral Stockdale, a distinguished naval aviator and test pilot flight instructor, flew over 240 carrier-based missions, earned 28 combat decorations, and after being shot down over North Vietnam in 1965, spent 8 years as a P.O.W., 4 years in leg irons, 2 years in complete darkness, tortured and beaten daily. It is amazing that he didn't go blind after 2 years in darkness, malnourished and sleeping on concrete. Despite all of his pain, his primary concern was always the welfare of his fellow prisoners and that they received enough food and proper medical care. Stockdale even organized a hunger strike when one prisoner was denied medical treatment. At one point, he knew that one of his fellow P.O.W.s was guilty of an infraction that would possibly lead to that prisoner's execution. His captors knew Stockdale knew who the guilty prisoner was, and tortured Stockdale without mercy. Knowing there would be more torture and fearful he would crack and give out the prisoner's name, Stockdale attempted suicide. Rather than bear the thought of one of his fellow prisoners being executed or subjected to the pain that was inflicted on him, he tried to take his own life. Stockdale's suicide attempt was unsuccessful, yet in the attempt, was the ultimate statement about Admiral James B. Stockdale, that he would rather have died than see a fellow American soldier suffer pain or death at the hands of their captors. That maybe true about GHWB, but perhaps not so about our current President. Adwarded the Congressional Medal of Honor in 1976, Admiral Stockdale died in July of 2005. Even GHWB would tell you that CVN-77 should have been named after Admiral Stockdale.   Why isn't that in your book, Doro? On October 7th, 3 days after your book was released, you christened the USS George H.W. Bush, CVN-77. It rained that day. So much so that the ceremony was closed to the public+books
not as good as her 1st 2 books+N+this book was very disappointing. i LOVED her 1st two books. so when this book came out i was very excited. after reading it, i found it was rather dull and not very funny. there were very few parts that actually made me laugh, unlike her 1st two books+books
Excellent Book+P+I bought this book 4 months ago because as an aspiring chef I have the need to learn as much as possible for lack of teachers in my area.  I have learned how to make mayonaise, most of the basic sauces and the PATE and the crowd pleaser, Turkey Gallantine.  I am thrilled to have this book amongst her other books in my collection which i refer to daily.  I recommend this book to anyone who is wanting to learn from the masters (as there is not very many of them left)the art of cooking and making french and any other type of food.  As for people who claim some sort of health knowledge like tereshina (which she obviously does not posses), I think she is one of those bitter people that needs to add some sugar and spice to her already depressing and pathethic life or better yet keep eating that darn styrofoam junk+books
Hit me over the head with a club+N+Grisham's worst book by far.  90% of the story is preaching to the reader that homeless people just have bad luck and are good guys.  It would be ok if that was woven into a good story, but it is not.   For great Grisham read The Firm and The Partner.  For very good, read Runaway Jury and Pelican Brief.  All of these are page turners.  Street Lawyer is a stomache turner.  Really bad.  What happened+books
escape from reason+P+this book is short and brief (100 pages or so), that is its intended appeal.  it is not and does not claim to be a comprehensive analysis of all theological and philosophical thought-- just a very thoughtful and broad view of the impact of thought, art, industry, etcetera and its culmination on the state of our current society.   to this end the book is fullfilling+books
This book REALLY wants you to know it's a book...+N+I like self-reference jokes. I enjoy them quite a bit, actually. But this book beats you over the head with it. I wanted to read the whole thing, just so I could feel like I had a more informed opinion than I would otherwise, but I got about halfway through and there was no sign of it ever getting any better. I see a lot of reviews full of praise here, but for me reading this was incredibly tedious. He lost me forever when he was being interviewed to be on The Real World. The only reason I gave this book two stars was because I didn't finish reading it and it could be that the constant self-reference is actually some genius device in which we're shown how arrogant the main character is. But I don't really care, I hated it.+books
Not a developer book+N+I will have to put myself in the same corner as a few of my fellow reviewers, this is not a developer book, by far. It also has a lot of repetition in it. You can explain the different security groups twice, but 5 times seems like a little too much... The fact that web parts and customisations are not covered is like the biggest dissapointment to me, because that is what I am looking for in a book.

Dangerous advice puts young women's health at risk+N+This book missed a great opportunity to educate young women about the health risks involved in being sexually active. The author advises living together before marriage but devotes only a few woefully inadequate paragraphs to educating young women about protection from sexually transmitted diseases. Worse yet, the information provided is dangerously incomplete and incorrect, putting the health of young women readers at risk. This book fails to give young women the tools they need to be proactive in protecting their health above all else. Surviving your twenties SAFELY is more critical than surviving your twenties with style+books
I simply don't understand......+N+I hate to be yet another naysayer here, but seriously....what is all the hype about these books? My poor sister (who for some reason loved them) told me to read them, and I struggled for WEEKS to finish the first book in the series. Normally, a book of Eragon's size and reading level would be devoured by me in less that a day or two. However, upon reading the first chapter, I was struck almost immediately by the choppy sentence structure. Almost all the sentence were the same length. It was hard for me to read more than a chapter at a time because passages simply did not flow well at all.   When I finally finished Eragon, I thought that the second one had to be better, since it got published. I was dead wrong. Both books had an incredibly boring story, derivative plot, unoriginal characters and setting (also names stolen almost directly from Tolkien!!  ), pedestrian language and writing style, wooden dialogue (every character spoke with the same exact "voice," none were really distinct from each other), and cliched expression after cliched expression. In Eragon at least, the entire book was full of passages of "purple prose." Worst of all, the author only TOLD and hardly ever SHOWED the reader what the characters were feeling. Speaking of characters, Eragon sorely lacked both character description (I didn't even know what Murtagh was supposed to look like or how old he was until the book was almost over), and there was almost no character development whatsoever. I felt no emotional involvement and didn't care a thing for almost any of the characters. Making the reader care about their characters is one of the most important things authors must do to create a meaningful story with emotional depth. For instance, if George R. R. Martin can make me learn to love a traitorous villain who commits incest with his sister, then why can't I care about the "perfect" titular HERO of these books???    Believe me, I gave this series many chances to impress....and it failed. I love the idea of Dragon Riders (a la the Pern series) and I thought the character of Saphira had some good things about her. Being a linguist, I love the idea of language having a deep, abiding power of its own (which has also been done a la Tolkien and Le Guinn), but the things in this story just felt like a boy's fantasy daydream, down to the sexy elf chick in tight leather of all things.  Just because someone is young and writes a novel does not make said novel good nor does it make said novelist a prodigy. I truly think that the only reason either of these books were published in the first place is because Paolini's parents were the ones who published them.   My apologies if my rant offends anyone, I'm just a little upset that I spent so long plodding through this only to find that it did not improve. Normally when I read a book, I can tell its good because of the shivers of excitement I feel while devouring page after page. That quality is the main thing that was missing from Paolini's works. I truly hope he has a chance to improve his writing over time. +books
Big Trouble Starts Early On+N+Interesting experimental fiction.  In Big Trouble, Barry employs the technique of shifting protagonists so well that in the end the reader isn't sure who the story is about.  Characters are abandoned with abandon and neglected through carelessness, leaving a laser sharp focus on what the novel is really about--which is not the psychodelic frog.  It's something less original.  The genre is also well disguised.  Is it a comedy or a thriller?  If a novel is funny, can we take the thriller part seriously enough?  In some cases, yes.  When, for example, the comedy is built on clever dialogue by characters truly capable of mayhem.  In this case, no.  It's a little jarring when a comic cop is traveling around, chained to an entertainment center, while a teenage girl is in the clutches of a sex-oriented crazy.  In all fairness, the novel does feature a ticking clock, which is handy to have in a thriller.  It's more effective if there is something believable about the story.  I expected a novel with an overdose of silliness, but I was spared that, which was a plus.  No characters with absurdly meaningful names.  The nuts and bolts aspect of writing was competently performed.  While there was little depth to any characters, that's probably less of a requirement for characters  we want to laugh at.  The characters could have used some personality, but that's a common flaw.  The novel should have been funny in places, for a list of situations would show some potential.  But I had no difficulty keeping a straight face throughout.  Others would disagree.  The politically incorrect portrayal of Miami was entertaining, if not actually funny.  The overall effect of reading Big Trouble is to bring about a yearning for the days when an editor would say, "Sir, I know your name is a household word, and I know we could make money on whatever you write, but I have to turn down too many good novels to give a green light to...to something like this."  If there ever were such days. +books
Animals deserve only love and tenderness+N+Animals should NEVER receive negative punishment (physical or mental). Why should you, when the positive reinforcemt methods have poved to work so well and makes your animal obey you out of respect and not out of fear as the negative reinforcement does? The use of negative reinforcemt stems from a lack of true understanding of canine psychology (as it is utterly unnecessary) and a need to be sadistic. As a veterinarian and animal lover, I strongly advise against this book+books
Excellent!+P+I absolutely loved this sequel to Something Borrowed. Just as good as the first in my opinion.+books
A Cynic's Bible+N+"With the Dark Magicks that fill these pages" two types of cult could be founded: the cult of Kon-stantinos, or a cult of complete cynicism. As someone who cherishes his spiritual and magickal beliefs, I do not know which would be worse.   The author's insincerity is self-evident in every concept, and as usual he urges us to read on like we are about to encounter something earth-shattering...his tone is always "prescient" and always patronizing. The pseudo-goth aspect to Kon's writing is wearing seriously thin now and besides, any serious spiritual seeker will find the trappings insulting. His obsession with "naughty" alcohols such as the illegal absinthe is seriously sad.   His spiritual perspective is the same: he plays with a safe "bad boy" boy image but never has the balls to wrap it in anything but the "essentially I'm not so bad" image. The impression he gives to the intelligent seeker after spiritual inroads is that they do not sensibly exist in a modern and very contrived book such as this.  My one star I rate for "Nocturnicon" comes from the book cover, which is far better than the book deserves, and from the fact that he is quite a good technical writer. I have seen much worse get into print, including with his own publishing house, Llewellyn Publications. However if I was a cynic about occult arts, I would use this book to demonstrate why. As a reader I get the feeling that Kon-stantinos feels the same. He's looking to sell a concept, any concept. Here he happens to have fallen on one of the more questionable sets of references anyway - the Necromonicon - and in this case 1+1 = minus 5.   It seems that he is trying to mess us all up with that "little ****er" (he mentions in the intro) in his head. Either that or his misleading of the (mainly young deluded goth) public is incidental to his need for some kind of publicity. Which makes him a true Kon-man.                   +books
Extremely disappointing.+N+Although claiming to be a study of human-animal relationships, this book  offers an endless recital of man's inhumanity to man, to support the book's  theme that man's history with animals has been even worse. Very poorly  thought out and extremely long-winded, this book reads like an overblown  Usenet message--&quot;those other people are all so horrible, but we animal  lovers are OK, aren't we?&quot; Oddly, Serpell seems so rooted in the very  &quot;human supremacist&quot; philosophy that he rails against, that he  ends up reinforcing that very philosophy. Not enlightening at all; I feel  like a pall has been cast over my relationships with both people and  animals. You would learn far more by taking the money and time you might  waste on this book, and spending them on your own dog or cat or whatever  animal you please+books
Well done book for Church Education staff+P+This book is an excellent resource for Church Education staff. This book covers some basic principles (or laws as he calls them) regarding teaching in the church environment.  The law of readiness is my personal favorite of the bunch, as it basicially states that both student and teacher must be prepared for the teaching environment.  This is so true and often followed in higher education, but perhaps not very well followed in church education.  The sad news is that typicially the teacher is blamed for the students poor scholarship or lack orf learning.  But according to Henricks a student must study, must come to class on time, and must be interested in the material to proactively learn.    There is much more good stuff in this book.  Grab it its a great read+books
Enjoyable, and extremely well written +P+To say the least I enjoyed this book tremendously.  Not only for the story itself, but because of the creativity of the writing.  The way the story was told it is as if I had stood next to these characters throughout their lives and lived with them through their journey. And it is a journey we all have faced at one time or another. I have become a fan of Mr. Perronne, and the way he made his creation become a treasured part of my collection of books. I can't wait to read more from this very talented writer. A job well done!  +books
Don't Bother!+N+It's too bad that Clive Cussler changed collaborators on his "Oregon Files" series.  This was terrible!  I couldn't even finish it.  I read a lot in all different genres so I feel that I'm a little qualified to comment on a book I have read.  It dragged, some of the characters were changed and even though I know you have suspend disbelief, I couldn't keep my eyes open.  Golden Buddha and Sacred Stone were much better+books

Capote: A Literary Star who fell in tragic descent from the  heavens!+P+Truman Capote (1924-1984) was born in New Orleans to a wastrel con man father named Arch and a southern belle floozie from Alabama whose name was Lillie Mae. Lillie Mae and Arch divorced shortly after Truman's birth in New Orleans. The fragile child was raised in a succession of relatives homes. He was happiest in Monroeville, Alabama where his next door neighbor was Nellie Harper Lee (Lee was the author of "To Kill a Mockingbird" and served as Truman's girl Friday on his trips to Kansas to cover the Clutter murders turned into his best book "In Cold Blood."   Capote was effeminate and was a [...] man who had several lovers many of whom used him for money and travel. Capote (he took the name of his stepfather Joe Capote who ended up in New York prison for his dirty business accounting!)spent a sybaratic life of jet setting in the watering holes of Europe, Asia and the United States.    Capote was famous for his books, his talk show appearances on television, screenwriting and adoration of his "Swans" (such rich dames as Kay Graham of the Washington Post; Jackie Kenedy and her sister Lee and most notably Babe Paley wife of the President of CBS News.). Capote's famous 1966 Black and White Party of the rich and famous is still a landmark event in New York society annals.   Capote was only 5'3"; had a babyish voice and squandered his talents with works planned but never written such as his unfinished novel "Answered Prayers." HIs reputation rests on "Breafast at Tiffany's"; "In Cold Blood" and many excellent short stories.   Truman Capote could be manipulative, was spoiled and lived the life of a famous, spoiled and egotistical man. His death came after years of booze, drugs and sex in seedy places.   Clarke's book will sell well in the wake of the famous movie "Capote" and deserves to be read. Capote like F. Scott Fitgerald before him wasted his talents and died at a relatively young age.    Gerald Clark has written a well researched, gossipy and accurate account of the life of the southern boy who became famous and then was extinguished by his demons . A tragic and cautionary tale.+books
Out of Ideas+N+Back in his day Heinlein was the greatest writer of science fiction for adolescent boys. Unfortunately, that day is long past, and Heinlein has wandered far from his strength.  This book fills in some gaps from Time Enough for Love and is a rehash of much of that story from an alternate viewpoint.  As was the case in Time Enough for Love, sexual coupling of old men and young girls is a recurring theme. Examples: The two female lead characters brag to one another how they had their first sexual experience at ages 12 and 14 and with men 4 times their age.  The male lead goes back in time and has sex with his sister, then a young teen, and he, at this point, the oldest man in human history.  To make all this go down easier, the young females are the sexual aggressors and the old men are pursued, and said to be 'tripped' if she has her way with him.  There is a lot more of this 'weird sex', but I will move on.  This is not really a science fiction story per se, but there are a few trappings of science fiction used to decorate the story.  Most of it takes place in the first half of the 20th century in mid America.  There isn't really a plot.  The book is a series of anecdotes occuring in the life of this unlikely heroine, seemingly Heinlein's feminine ideal.  It is obvious that the author has run out of ideas at this late point in his career.  This book would not have been published if it was the work of an unknown author. +books
Laugh Out Loud On Every Page+P+I had never heard of The Borowitz Report until a couple of days ago, when a girl in my dorm showed me this book.  I opened it up to a random page and saw the headline "Bush May Lack Gene For Human Speech."  I started giggling as I read the piece and by the end of it I was laughing hysterically.  This happened again and again as I flipped through the book until I realized I was laughing out loud on every page.  No book has ever made me done that before.  (As for my TV viewing habits, I am a huge fan of The Daily Show and this book is right up there with it.)  The book is based on a daily e-newsletter called The Borowitz Report which I have now signed up to receive every day.  If the guy can manage to write columns each day that are as funny as the ones in this book, I don't know how he does it.  This book is at the very top of my list of recommendations.  You won't be sorry you got it+books
Crushingly Disappointing+N+Would the woman writing under Joyce Carol Oates' name these days please return America's greatest living author to us?  Seriously, this was the most unenjoyable, in fact most distressingly bad, book by Oates I've read, among the maybe thirty I have had the utmost pleasure to read.  I don't know what vein Oates is tapping to construct these writings but the prose does not sound like her at all, the stories themselves are unimpressive, unwelcoming, unpleasantly centered on people who do not merit consideration. And worse still, I find this is a trend with Oates these days. I can't think of a single book she's published since Middle Age that has been (yes, strictly in my opinion) any good. The short story in Female of the Species that was called "Madison at Guignol" was perhaps the worst Oates story ever published. (And yes I do understand the connotation of the word "Guignol" in the title.)  Some might accuse me of approaching Oates with preconceived notions and then recoiling when she fails to deliver what I, myself, wanted, but that's not the case. One thing I have always applauded in this author is her chameleon-like ability to cross genre boundaries and create tales so divergent in theme and tone that they could have been the opus of a half-dozen different people. I have avidly read along thru Gothic stories, mysteries, romances, non-genre pieces, novellas, poems, short fiction, novels, literary criticism and plays by Oates, and so I believe I can fairly say I do not stereotype Joyce Carol Oates or expect any one thing from her, but in this case, as much as reporting it pains me, this was a bad book and I can only hope Oates bucks the trend and reaches back into the well of talent the world knows she has, and that her next book(s) will be much better+books
Much-needed history for today's young women+P+I'm so glad to see a history for today's young women about what it was like before Title 9 - which, while it wasn't that long ago, seems unreal to my daughter's generation. I remember The Days Before, when the boys got the gym and were formed into athletic teams while the girls got WHAT PASSED for PE - calisthenics in the cafeteria! (and instructional time was used to move the tables and chairs aside)   In a day when feminism is facing a hostile backlash, Ms. Blumenthal's book is a valuable reminder that "what used to be" wasn't as rosy as some claim, a reminder of the gains made in sports by talented girls, and of what we DON'T want to return to! Five stars+books
Bored Stiff+N+You can read all about the book just from what is included in the jacket. Unbelievable potrayal of a women cast off a ship by her husband. All she wants to know is did he love her when he married her? Why did he do it? I mean give me a break! I would not lay low and try to make him go insane. I would go to the police.   I read books from beginning to end to give them a chance. This was a waste of my time+books

Eternity th Best Ever+P+Eternity is a sweeping vision defining the plot vein started with Stapleton's Starmaker and Zebrowski's Macroworld.  Extending from the near future to the Universe's end, Greg Bear paints a vision of Humanity (extended to all intelligentlife forms)at it's best and worst, and does it with very sympathetic characters, extensive and involved plots, and ingenious predictions on technology and evolution.  Plus, The Way - a constructed, self-contained universe made by man.  Quite possibly the best Science Fiction I have read.  If you read Eon, by Bear, this is a must-read sequal that far surpasses the original+books
A Masterpiece, sadly forgotten, worth reviving+P+Recently, I have read a lot of books on Creativity and Innovation. My big surprise is that virtually none of them mention Koestler's The Act of Creation. This is unfortunate because this book is probably the most authoritative examination of creativity. Attention to this classic is worth reviving.  Koestler examines three types of creativity - Humor, Science, and Poetry. Humor, according to him, is cruel (a valuable insight). Poetry, and other forms of art, integrate oneself with the World. Science occupies the neutral middle. It is amazing how Koestler manages to link all three kinds of creativity with a common framework.  My two biggest take-aways from this book are regarding the process of creation and its form.  As Koestler describes beautifully - "..uncovers, selects, re-shuffles, combines, synthesizes already existing facts, ideas, faculties, skills. The more familiar the parts, the more striking the new whole." This is corroborated by all geniuses who have stood `on the shoulder of giants'. Even inventors like Edison fit this framework. This is close to saying that instead of thinking `outside the box', link several boxes to each other.  The other great insight is that the final breakthrough is rarely verbal, but in images. So people see new insights in a dream-like trance, rather than expressing it in language. Language, probably, impedes creativity.   There are several more delightful and relevant insights on creativity in this masterpiece. Nearly a bible on creativity.+books

All about trading in the stock market+P+William O'neal covers all major stock trading areas in this book: how to find a broker, his CAN SLIM method for making money on stocks, When to sell,how to diversify, when to buy options, he shows charts of the biggest stock winners from 1953 to 1993, how to read stock price history charts and much more. It is a lot of information to take in and is not for beginners. I would advise reading "The neatest little guide to the stock market" before reading this book if you are just starting out in the land of individual stocks.  Here is a summary of his CAN SLIM method to making money in the stock market, this is how to buy stocks: C= Current quarterly earnings:are they enough? A=Annual earnings increases:do they have meaningful growth? N=New products,New management,New highs:is it time to buy? S=Supply and demand:Small capitalization plus big volume demand equals price increase. L=Leader or Laggard:Only buy leaders. I=Institutional sponsorship:A little will drive up price. M=Market Direction=How to determine it and follow.  The final chapter is 18 common mistakes most investors make, this is excellent advice for what not to do.  This book's author believes in buying for growth with little regard to actual value or P/E ratios. He justifies this by showing all the the big misses a value investor would have had not buying hot stocks over the years because a value investor would have thought they were over valued, when they were priced at a premium due to growth factors.  Great book I highly recommend+books
Happiness : A Guide to Developing Life's Most Important Skill+P+This is a scientific review of the Buddhist guide to a happy life.  Adds great credence to this approach and the Buddhist philosophy.

Good enough to pass the exam -- despite some typos+N+Overall, the book provides a good coverage of the exam material at a reasonable price and is easy to read, especially if compared to Harris book and the Official (ISC)2 Guide. At the same time, I noticed a few typos and inaccuracies, which was very unfortunate. That was why I gave it 2 stars instead of 4 that it deserves. At the end, it did the job, and I passed the exam, although, after reading this book, I reviwed a few CBK domains I was less familiar with in the Official (ISC)2 Guide. Unfortunately, none of the books I checked, including a more expensive Harris book and moreover, none of the cheap overviews like the Passport book, provides a 100% coverage of the material that is tested. Therefore, unless you have a real IT-related experience, you may be caught by surprise at the exam, no matter which book(s) you used. As for the typos, even the Official Guide has a few+books
Subtitled "Hire Gallup"+N+We use Gallup at my workplace.  Gallup is an excellent organization and we're better for working with them.  However, this was too much.  It's not a book.  It's a brochure.  Their Engagement Index is brilliant, but you can skim the other 260 pages without missing anything important.   +books
With an ever-growing sense of direct contemporary relevance+P+The collaboration of Rebecca M. Blank (Dean of the Gerald R.FordSchool of Public Policy and Professor of Economics, University of Michigan) and William McGurn (Chief Editorial Writer, Wall Street Journal), Is The Market Moral?: A Dialogue On Religion, Economics &amp; Justice is a literate discussion of serious issues of economic equality, efficiency, productivity, and social justice. The contrasting views of two strong-willed, intelligent, faithful, and astutely reasoned individuals - one a &quot;cultural Protestant&quot;, the other a Roman Catholic, both concerned with issues of morality and human feedom to choose as surely as technical problems of supply and demand. Add in drastic changes wrought by increased globalization in today's world, and the evaluations followed by direct and personally addressed rebuttals in Is The Market Moral? take on an ever-growing sense of direct contemporary relevance, even urgency+books
The Bottom Line: the 3BL Fad Promises More than it Delivers+N+Triple bottom line (3BL) accounting promises to keep score of "people, profits, and planet" -- meaning that it enables a company to measure not only its financial results, but also its environmental, and social impact as well.   It is, to be sure, a very good idea for companies to pay attention to their impact on the environment and to the contribution they make to their community and to society at large. And in business, what gets measured gets done -- so what is not to like about triple bottom line thinking?  At one level, there is nothing not to like. It is a minor fad and a fairly low nuitrition fad at that. There is nothing wrong with the occassional bite of ice cream -- but that hardly recommends it as a diet.  There are two problems with 3BL, and this book glosses over or ignores both of them. The first problem is one of measurement. We can measure financial result with standard accounting tools. This is not pure science and as with any performance measurement system, some people cheat -- but we know what cheating is and what results we are trying to measure. Moreover, we have a common unit of currency -- money.   There is no comparable way to measure environmental or social impact. Quick example: a company that is passionate about its 3BL principles recently explained to me how they were avoiding dumping excess product into landfill by donating it to needy Africans. They proudly gave themselves environmental credit for avoided landfill and social credit for a donation. Problem is, the Africans don't want this stuff, so they dump it in their own landfills. The program is completely wasteful, but the company tells its employees and customes that it is a 3BL business.   Social and environmental accounting are in any case not new. The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the SA 8000 from Social Accountability International, the AA 1000 from AccountAbility, as well as parts of various ISO standards are all efforts by international agencies or accounting firms to report non-economic aspects of company behavior. 3BL contributes nothing to this beyond packaging -- and occassionally misleading packaging at that.  Andy Savitz seems like a capable and well-meaning guy. But his book is built on a caricature of the corporation as a greedy, self-interested monolith. Unfortunately, the new thinking he brings to 3BL isn't very good -- and the good thinking isn't very new+books
Trite characters+N+I wanted to read something "light" but the characters were too simplistic and lacked depth. The story was predictable and the plot presentaton was choppy.  Comparing this book to others where, I believe, friendships were the main theme, this book lacked substance+books
Wickedly witty,delightfully droll...+P+Lemony Snicket's popular A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS continues with more miserable adventures for the Baudelaire orphans. In THE MISERABLE MILL,the children are sent to the dull town of Paltryville to work in the gloomy "Lucky Smells Lumbermill".In the next volume,THE AUSTERE ACADEMY,the Baudelaires attend the dreary "Prufrok Prepatory School" run by the dimwitted,meanspirited vice principal Nero.In the sixth episode,the Baudelaires are sent to their distant relatives, Jeremy and Esme Squalor, to live in their oversized penthouse.  Lemony Snicket continues his mysterious references to his lost love Beatrice, humorous definitions of words and an ability to make young readers sympathize with the Baudelaire orphans.    RATING:A+books
Rugged and regal account of historical criminals+P+This is one of those books which needs a little introduction: in Australia, the Kelly Gang is famous the way that Dillinger or Bonnie and Clyde are in the US. This book shows Peter Carey trying (with much success) to recreate the rugged conditions of Australian life, and it is very well-written in a kind of rough-backcountry slang. It shows how incredibly talented Peter Carey is, and how his talents can be adapted over a wide range of subject matter+books
I caught a fish, this big!+N+In Let Freedom Ring, Sean Hannity sends out the subliminal message that he and his writing are about truth, justice, and the American way. Just the title represents everything true and good about him and America. For his five-star reviewers his message reinforces their pre-conceived beliefs and Hannity's words are the validation of those beliefs.  If this was written by a ghost writer, he should have withheld payment. If it wasn't written by a ghostwriter, Hannity should have one for his next attempt at literary hyperbole.  The first chapter is written in a maudlin, "those-were-the-good-old-days" wistfulness of his immigrant grandfather who he describes as an honest man of integrity, and a believer in the American dream. But before you can say "Erin Go Braugh" he is talking about the courage of George W. Bush for standing up to terrorism. Exactly how G.W. does, he doesn't elaborate. How he goes from grandfather to Dubbya is a bit of magic.  Hannity's next trick is to impugn Clinton and Gore as being soft on terrorism. His source for this is, of all people, Dick Morris who knew the Clintons and now works for the Fox Republican Advocacy Network. He quotes Morris who makes such vague statements as "It seemed they were afraid of talking about terrorism," or "they seemed to be indifferent to terrorism." These "Morris mind-reads" are conjectural, but Hannity uses them, which he does with impunity.  Let's take a closer look at Hannity's unimpeachable source for a moment. It was Dick Morris who quit the Clintons shortly after the second election. It was Morris who had a penchant for streetwalkers, did some jail time, and entered alcohol rehab. You'd think SH could find a better source if he expects freedom to ring!  But, Hannity doesn't skip a beat. He points out how democrats such as Senators Kerry and Daschle voted against certain defense-spending bills. What he neglects to inform his readers are the reasons they did because of riders that were attached to the bills, or the number of republicans who also voted against the same bills, or the many defense bills that Kerry and Daschle did vote for. He never once advises his reader of the defense spending programs that were killed by Dick Cheney when he was Secretary of Defense. Such deception is called propaganda.  Propaganda is something that Hannity has no compunction using here. This he does in continuing to tell a tale that has long since been debunked. Namely, it is the story of President Clinton being offered Osama bin Laden by the Sudanese government. Again, it's what he doesn't say that misdirects the reader. Sudan made the offer in the hope of having the economic sanctions against them for slave-trading, lifted. However, the FBI determined that the Sudanese were playing us because they had neither the ability nor the intent of handing over bin Laden. The Sudanese also made the offer to Saudi Arabia, but the Saudis had revoked bin Laden's citizenship, and refused to take him.  Benjamin Franklin said "Statistics is a liar." Hannity uses charts for the same purpose. He shows how under Reagan, the army bought over 500 tanks. Under Clinton, the army bought none. This leads one to the assumption that Clinton did nothing for the services. He doesn't mention that the army buys tanks, not presidents. He doesn't mention the army had all the tanks they needed for armored warfare against the Soviet Union that never came. He doesn't mention that the army began changing its warfare strategies which would include more transportable fighting vehicles.  Be grateful that Hannity cannot rewrite famous works of literature as he attempts to do with history. If he could, instead of seeing a dead Captain Ahab being killed by the whale in "Moby Dick," we might just see a grinning captain standing next to a tethered whale with the caption: "I caught a fish this big!"  There's something very fishy about his facts, his historical parallels which aren't parallel, and what he chooses to tell you, and what he chooses to leave out.  In this book, he tells whale-sized whoppers!       +books
Book=Excellent, Binding=Poor+P+Love, love, love the book. Reading his recipes has changed me from an "adventurous cook" to a truly great one. Thanks Mr. Bittman.  But about that binding...My copy is now a 80 volume edition. I am sick of digging though all of the loose pages to find the recipes that I want. After I take the book from the shelf, there are always a number of pages that didn't travel with the cover. Ugh. I have no idea how to fix this. I'm here for another copy. *sheepish grin+books

I can not believe people go to seminar to hear this guy. The GOLDEN RULE... If the system works then may be start a hedge fund.. If it does not then write a book...hold seminar...+books
Not impressed+N+Searching For Caleb had a new setting every five pages, family members who walked out and wouldn't have come back until they were "kidnapped", and chaotic events that led to a suicide, all of which made this book interesting in an unusual way. This book is first set on a train going to New York City in the year of 1972. Then the scene changes to Cairo Mill, Maryland. Suddenly it changes to Baltimore, Maryland in the 1800's. A bit later it changes to Baltimore in 1980. Anne Tyler told most of the story in Maryland, but at the end, she changes to Louisiana. The story was about the Peck family, which was a very sophisticated family. Wealthy, respectable, self-involved, they always wore hats.  Even the little girls never went out of the house without a hat on. Basically the story was about Daniel Peck's search for his brother, Caleb, who walked off in 1912. It was also about his granddaughter Justine Peck's realization that she will never be the Peck that she always dreamed to be. The concept of this book, then, is finding oneself. Daniel Peck's main conflict was evident in his search for Caleb. When Caleb was in his twenties he just walked out on the family and didn't return or make contact with any family member. The search started when Daniel moved in with Duncan and Justine Peck. Daniel spent years researching and visiting people who might have known Caleb. He would visit people that were Caleb's friends or appeared in pictures with Caleb. Unfortunately, he had absolutely no luck. So when Daniel's birthday came, his oldest son "Two" hired him a private investigator to search for Caleb. The private investigator headed straight to work asking questions. He found out that when Caleb was younger all one would have to do to find Caleb was "Hold still a minute and listen." He found out how Caleb loved music. He also went searching to Caleb's home in Baltimore.  Then the private investigator learned where Caleb was just outside of New Orleans, Louisiana. The private investigator told the Pecks this but before Daniel could meet Caleb, Daniel died of a heart attack. This book was draining yet funny; mostly draining. The hardest part was keeping track of what part the story was in, whether the past or the present.  Also the Peck family was absolutely insane. Actually two cousins ended up married to each other. That caused so much chaos that a separation, a disowning and a suicide happened over the event. Then Justine and Duncan were constantly moving because Duncan would become restless and wanted a change. Justine just went along very easily but Meg, their daughter, hated moving. She locked herself in the bathroom a few times.  Daniel did not begin looking for his brother for practically 30 years after Caleb walked out. The comical parts were the best. For instance, all the time that Daniel was searching for Caleb his old maid knew right where Caleb was. When Caleb left, he had told her where he was going. Yet she never told anyone because no one ever asked her. In addition, Duncan would cut out newspaper clippings and stick them to things.  To the old Ford that the door was torn off he stuck a clipping that said "Wouldn't you rather have a Buick?". When Meg bought an expensive dress, his cut out was "Have you ever had a bad time in Levi's?" One of Justine's neighbor was divorced and the father of her child who had no visiting rights would come and take the daughter. The mother would scream and shout about her daughter being kidnapped, yet every night the father brought the child home safe and sound. This book was very interesting, but a strange kind of interesting.  It never really caught my attention; rather it often put me to sleep.  It was summer reading, the kind you get on a book list.  I would suggest it to people if they didn't really have anything else to read. But some will like it. I found it too scattered in place and time and too slow moving.+books
Do yourself a favor and stop after Chapter 3+N+The first chapter will pique your interest. The next two chapters will present interesting examples of emergent behavior. The remainder of the book will likely leave you feeling frustrated at the poor presentation and disappointed at the lack of follow-through on your expectations from chapter 1. The density of useful information drops precipitously as the book progresses, degrading to something at or below what you would expect to read in a blog (I'm serious). I must admit I haven't been able to finish the last chapter+books
useless+N+This book has no useful information in it.  The pictures are pretty, but I don't spend good money on a book just to look at the pictures.  Even the ideas aren't all that creative. If I had cupboards full of antiques and drawers full of beautiful linens, I wouldn't need a book to tell me how to use them. Other, better books show the same techniques and ideas, and show them with materials more easily available to us mere mortals.   The example that really did me in was the little girl's birthday party... with crocheted lace doilies on the drinks glasses, and all the little girls in Edwardian-style lace dresses.  PLEASE!  You want an example of a pretty child's birthday party, get the Shabby Chic entertaining book+books
NYT "Top 50" list+P+This book is phenomenally crafted, written with heart and sincerity.   I cannot recommend it strongly enough.  I learned about it through the recent New York Times "top fifty" recommended list, which included several authors I'd never heard of.   Frankly I was concerned that the list would have a couple of weak entries as happens.  "Independence Day" reaffirms my faith in reviews, polls, awards (Pulizer) and I'm glad to know that this is just the second installment of an iconic series.  To say the language "Independence Day" is poetic is an understatement.  Ford exercises control over both the vernacular and the estoric (on average I didn't know a word every five pages, but that's a good thing - the language is rich and sincere as is the engrossing narrative).  The word "Angstrom" appears in the book, perhaps a footnote to Updike, who knows?  Frank's sale to the Markhams is one of those protracted dramas, no, comedies, that weaves through like a Wagner liefmotif.   Wait, that simile strikes the wrong key, because the Markhams, as you get to know them, and you will, in richly parenthetical passages, represent everything you the reader and Frank dislike about pure unadulterated dumbasses.  Ok, I can go on and on about this book, it's subtleties, it's heartwrenching passages about love and divorce, but no, go read it+books
Only connect?+N+Our entire book club disliked this book. We had a hard time feeling a connection to the characters. Howard, the largest presence in this story, feels like a blank at the core. Upon putting this book down, his motivations and what might be in his heart were still a mystery to me. Characters such as Jerome, Victoria, and Carl were intriguingly introduced, but then inconsistently treated for the rest of the text. Especially Carl - he just disappears - no resolution to his story at all. As am homage to Howard's End, some of the parallels were not strongly enough underscored to flesh out this book for me. For example, the heart-to-heart connection between Kiki Belsey and Carlene Kipps does not jump off the page at you the way the connection between Margaret Schlegel and Mrs. Wilcox did.   I thought Zora was one of the most interesting characters, and I like how Smith contrasted her obviously high intelligence and intellectual arrogance with her social awkwardness and sexual insecurity. But Smith makes her smug a bit too often, and so feeling a connection with Zora is difficult as well - most of the time I just wanted to smack her. And I have to agree with the others that Smith needs to brush up on her American characterizations. There was next to no authenticity in that regard. Especially the Southern dialogue - laughable!  It also feels like Smith had a hard time figuring out how to end this book...I understand that end is supposed to be a beginning of sorts...but the fact that there were so many plot threads left dangling, unresolved, by the last page just gave me a feeling of incomplete-ness.   Aaaargh...must go and re-read Howard's End to dispell the queasy feeling left by On Beauty+books
Poisonous Misinformation+N+The most depressing thing about a book like this is not the outrageously inaccurate content, but, based on the high ratings and adulatory comments by other reviewers, that most people actually believe this drivel. How can we possibly form an effective energy policy when the citizenry are not only uninformed but ill-informed? The answer is that we cannot. I will not bother to go through a detailed criticism, not only because it would take an almost book length document to do it, but because, in the highly politicized atmosphere we live in, no one would believe it. Today, the "truth" depends much more on one's political views than on an objective evaluation of the evidence.+books
A Vision of a Fundamentalist's Dream+P+If anyone wants to know what living in post-revolution Iran is like for a woman, this is the book.  Great detail is given to how the messages of western literature apply to life in the theocratic totalitarian state. The scariest thing, for me, is how closely the vision of Iran held by muslim extremists conforms to the stated vision of the U.S. held by christian extremists.  This touched me with reality the way The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood touched me with fictional possibility.  I have to say that I felt undereducated where her literary criticisms came in+books
Words Fail Me+P+This is my all-time favorite book from my all-time favorite author.  The ending of this book will stay with me forever--it captures so eloquently the precious fragility of life, of relationships, of family.    If you're looking for action packed melodrama, look elsewhere.  But if you're looking for insight into the day-to-day details of what it is to be human, you've hit the jackpot here. +books
Ahead of his time+P+JA Rodgers was ahead of his time when it came to historical reserch. He exposed alot of things that even in our xenophobic world we are afriad to talk about. He discovered through his reserch many of the great people of the past was infact blacks,and that they had been covered up by white wash over centuries. People should read these books with an open mind,because it explains alot in our soceity that are very race conscious people. I learned about Al Jahiz though him and he taught me about many great people I had never even heard of. I never knew about lokman the southern Arabian sage that was considered one of the wisest men. I never knew about the black vikings in this book called blaumen. The book also discussed how many people of the royal family have indeed black ancestry and how they have tried to hide these facts. Get this book to expose the truth and check out other JA Rodgers books+books
lame+N+OK, Mr. Koontz,  Could you please write a book that is not about dogs and how they are proof of god's existence.  This lame theme is more like preaching than entertainment.  Leave your retarded religious beliefs out of your books and maybe your stories will be good again.  Your novels used to be thriling page turners about survival...now they are just lame religious stories about god and dogs.  What has happened to you, Mr. Koontz?  Are you losing your mind?  Have fun at church...and don't forget to donate another $1,000 to President Bush.  I refuse to read any novel of yours that was written after '95 or so.  That seems to be around the time that you became a kook+books
Left Behind Series +N+The Left Behind series is the best reading I have ever read. I admit my reading is not all that much, but when I read the very first book I was hooked, I read all twelve books in about six weeks. They lead me to understand the Bible better. Thank you Tim and Jerry for such great books.       Corrine Robinson   +books
Boot Camp+P+I read Making The Corps by Thomas Ricks a long time ago. This is the classic U S Marine Corps recruit  yellow footprints/boot camp/drill instructor/obstacle course/rifle range story. You can't put the book down. Even if you know the story, it is good to hear it again. Buy it. Lately, the quality of the writing of Marine Corps literature has climbed. This book should be sold with One Bullet Away: The Making Of A Marine Officer by Nathaniel Fick. Fick gives us the story of the training a Marine officer candidate receives at Quantico.  Fascinating reading. Fick tells a story that is often hinted at in other books but is rarely told. If you have only one of these books, then you must buy the other. These two books are classic Marine Corps literature. They are both required reading in the Marine library+books
God awful+N+The whole thing was just awful, I don't mind telling you.  I don't know why anyone would buy the book for the recipes to start with when there are so many "meals in 30 minutes" internet sites...all completely nutritional with different caloric contents. Then there's the advice...it was just as bad, I found. Well, bad in the sense that it was silly.  Really quite silly.  I must admit that I must agree with the reviewer that said if you are eating an entire plate of French Fries, or Freedom Fries, depending, and you don't know that you are eating something that is going to put some pounds on, then reading this book isn't going to help you.  It does kind of sound like the positive reviews are all written by people that know the author personally.  Sounds a little bit like the Pentagon's planted news stories in Iraq if you don't mind my saying+books
Splendid narrative of a horrific catastrophe+P+This is a true McCullough masterpiece. Written in his usual flowing prose, he recounts the events leading up to possibly the most catastrophic natural disaster to date in American history.   On May 31, 1889 the dam at the South Fork fishing and hunting club burst following torrential rains of some 6-8 inches. His vivid description of the aftermath, death and suffering is chilling. He provides recounts of several individual and family experiences that are touching to say the least.   The events leading up to the disaster are vividly delineated as well. The South Fork fishing and hunting club was established by a small group of super-elite Americans (e.g. Carnegie). The club was situated up the valley from Johnstown, Pennsylvania. The dam that held the lake fished by the elite suffered the brunt of much scrutiny in the years preceding the disaster. Many argued that it's poor design and integrity made it vulnerable to giving way in the event of heavy rains. The dam bursting was talked about for years preceding the event. Many joked about it, but most thought such a calamitous event to be highly unlikely.  Following a late Spring holiday parade in 1889, the "impossible" occured. The dam gave way, and the lake entered the valley, sweeping locomotives, train tracks, woods, houses, stores along with it. Entire small communities were enveloped by the heap of muck and debris on the way to Johnstown. The death toll was some 2200. McCullough paints vivid pictures of the event itself as well as the suffering in the aftermath. The corpses and muck posed and immense public health threat, with a typhoid outbreak following the disaster.   The blame was quickly placed on the elite members of the South Fork fishing and hunting club for neglecting upkeep on the dam that held their precious little weekend and holiday reserve. It's a tale of early conspicuous consumption, and disturbing to find that the wealthy members of the club refused to take blame for anything.  Along the way, McCullough provides historical detail of the industrial revolution in its beginnings. The development steel mills, railroads, refineries, labor conditions, and business dealings of the financially elite are all intertwined in his recount of Johnstown.  Also, details of death counts at the make shift morgues, financial support during the aftermath (President Harrison sent a personal check in the amount of $300.00) and a list of the names of the dead bring the story to life for the reader. Eerie recounts of coroners' descriptions of corpses in their logs will make your skin crawl.  Clara Barton began organizing the American Red Cross in 1881. She had worked on more minor floods in the valley prior to 1889. Her work at Johnstown earned her dinner with the President Harrison in Washington following her five months of pure dedication in Johnstown.  This is a fantastic book. The Katrina disaster sparked my interest and I was not disappointed. If only Clara Barton were head of the Red Cross during the Katrina aftermath..+books
Put the Bite Back into Liberal Politics+P+In this Book, Ted Rall has as much criticism for the Democrats as for the Republicans.  Predictably, Rall goes after the Republicans for their hate filled rhetoric and their disregard for future generations of Americans.  The Republican party is cashing in now, but future generations will have to pay off the mounting debt (I thought conservatives were supposed to be fiscally responsible types).  What may be even worse, the Republicans are alienating people and nations all over the world.  Sure, we're the superpower now, but nothing lasts forever.  Do you want other nations to give us a helping hand or kick us when we're down?  That depends on how we treat other nations now, while we have power.  Pre-emptively invading countries doesn't win any brownie points.  The Democrats get criticized for being too moderate and too nice.  Instead of using the same dirty tricks and viscious political rhetoric that the Republicans use, the Democratic Party just sits back and takes the blows.  This isn't good for the image of the party.  Also, Rall believes that the Democratic Party is too disorganized.  There is no central message for liberals everywhere.  There are only small groups who only care about their own issues.  If the Democrats hope to come back to power, they're going to have to get their act together.  This book is an interesting read for those who consider themselves free thinkers+books
Racist Classist Megalomaniac Talks A Little About Heroin+N+After hearing some decent things about this book, I was surprised at just how uninteresting and often offensive of a read it turned out to be.  Marlowe is accurate in some of her depictions of heroin use in the East Village of New York and way off base in others.  I chalk this up to everyone's experiences being different (however, I certainly don't think a one-bag-a-day habit with weeks off in between makes her an authority on addiction by any stretch of the imagination).  What I don't understand is why she felt the need to go into such great detail about her rather boring life between her discussions of the dope world.  Most of her anecdotes had little to no bearing on the story she was trying to tell and were mind-numbingly dull.  I found her narrative to be very disjointed and incoherent.  But what I found most repugnant was her better-than-thou attitude towards those of a lower class or darker skin tone (e.g. assuming dark-skinned men who didn't think to aspire to become more than security guards must not have gotten support or affirmation in their homes growing up, like she did).  She herself says that she became interested in street-life and street people in order to increase her "coolness" factor.  Sure she dabbled in drug use and in the East Village culture, but that does not make her an authority, and she does not paint a very true portrait of either.  If you want a good portrayal of street life and heroin use from the inside, read Seth Morgan's Homeboy.  If you want elitist drivel, this book should do the trick+books
Not one of Quindlen's best+N+This book was easy enough to read, it just wasn't what I expected from Quindlen.  I usually find her writing style and her way of thinking about things so captivating, in this book I really did not find either of those traits to stand out.  The back-and-forth from current day to the past was somewhat confusing, and sometimes I was in the middle of a paragraph before I realized this paragraph was a jump to the past, whereas the previous paragraph was present time.  Although I got used to that writing style, I always found it annoying.  The storyline itself never sold me either: a typical, young "sew-your-wild-oats" boy finds a baby and decides to keep it and is the "perfect" father. I just did not find such an occurrence likely.  And, as a mother myself, all the times he either left the newborn alone or took it with him while he labored on the land just made me squirm. Anyway the whole story seemed far-fetched and disjointed to me, and a disappointment especially since I have been a Quindlen fan for many, many years+books
Crank-theory and work of an amateur+N+A poory written, racially charged work by a bitter, probably mentally ill schoolteacher that gives the illusion of having a "key" to historical development. In addition to the cycle of history thesis, he identifies eight civilizations and their birth to death cycle, Spengler points to a nation's "will" and race as the key to a "kultur's" success.   This is the sort of crank theory that held an appeal to National Socialists and amateur history buffs for whom decline mythology holds an attraction-- facts be damned.   Interesting as an historical footnote but dismissed by anyone with a serious foundation in history and historical analysis.+books
Infamous Bridge-Burner Offers Highly Subjective Opinion On Writing+N+No wonder John Gardner didn't write more fiction books.  He was far too preoccupied with what he believes makes good fiction, rather than actually writing it.  "Creative atrophy" I believe John Gardner himself would call it.  If there's ever been a better example of the "those who can't do, teach" argument, I haven't encountered it.  This is hardly the place a "Young Writer" should start.  Instead, how about reading what you like and avoiding "ignoramouses" such as John Gardner?  John Gardner is unable to accept the fact that many of the world's finest writers never made it through college, and many more didn't have the luxury of a "rigorous classical education."   The most hilarious part is where Gardner mentions that only through a line-by-line university level discussion will anybody ever be able to fully enjoy Shakespeare.  It's interesting to note how Gardner, who "taught" creative writing at the university level, fails to exhibit the critical thinking and objectivity he says one can only obtain through a college education+books
Absolutely Wonderful!+P+1970s suburbian life style is the setting of this compelling novel. This story follows the lives and drama surrounding a small town where four beautiful girls try to break free of their strict parents in very sinful ways. The book is narrated by a small groups of boys who become bewitched and pulled into the drama of these young girls lives. I absolutely love this book it was so real and full of heart and sisterly honour. That may not sound so great to those who understand the kind of honour these girls have with one anothers but its a wonderful novel that isnt for the faint at heart. It hits hard into a common death and problem among young girls and young boys+books
Myths?  More like Facts to me+N+Myth #1: American women live under patriarchy   Myth # 2: America's the World's leading threat to the environment   Myth # 3: America is a racist nation   Myth # 4: The Untied States is an imperial power.   Myth # 5: The rich get richer, the poor get poorer   ALL FACTS.  Plus, The higher the IQ the more liberal someone is. Ben Franklin, Einstein, our founding forefathers like Thomas Jefferson...all liberals. The lower the IQ the more conservative because it is easier to not think for yourself. I love America, but changes need to be made.  Rome fell too eventually from bad politics+books
Love it+P+This book is such a blessing to me. I'm only up to day 8 (their are 100 days worth of devotions and prayers) and I haven't over-eaten once. God is using this book to bless me. Please buy it, read it, and let God use it in your life. Giving God your eating habits and your size will be the best thing you can do for yourself. This book IS worth getting. Please buy it and find out for yourself how much it can help you. It's helping me. It's more than helping me, it's giving me victory+books

EXCELLENT REVIEW OF THE ENERHY SITUATION+P+Very technical book with a great overview about energy and hydrocarbons in particular. I would not recommend this book as a first book about peak oil, this book is definately written for an audience that has more of a scientific background, but if you are concerned about the phenomenon of peak oil and have the ability to grasp basic scientific concepts, then this book is excellent. Not so much political as some of the other peak oil books, Deffeyes is a second generation petroleum man and a university professor. He deals with the fundamental aspects of peak oil as it relates to oil as a natural resource. Still, I believe that this book is essential reading to anyone trying to come to grips with the idea of peak oil and I highly recommend this book to all concerned people that can deal with the basic science involved. Peak oil is a fact, and everyone needs to understand the reasons why the human race needs to reduce our consumption of oil as soon as possible+books
What's wrong with me???+P+All women have their problems, but for Bridget Jones, with her seemingly permanent single life, for which all of her married acquaintances obsessively harass her about, her habit of drinking a little too much, and her trouble with her weight, which seems to mysteriously rocket up and down, the poor thing just can't seem to catch a break.   An instantly lovable character, Bridget is real, and her complaints about life and men are often hilarious and believable. Her conversations with her friends are also extremely enjoyable as they dish and grumble about all the things that men do wrong, which, you know, are quite a lot. Often her musings and thoughts, the "What's wrong with me," and her compulsively-fixated dieting and attempts at positive reinforcement, are very entertaining.    Very funny book that is different in several ways from the movie; so if you have seen the movie, try the book (books).   +books
If I could choose 0 stars, I would. +N+I recently borrowed this as an audiobook from the library because I need something to occupy my mind while I scan microfiche at work (boooorrring). I actually haven't finished this book yet, but up until what I listened to tonight, I hadn't made my mind up yet on how I felt about it. I was going to see it though, but now I'm not sure if I will.  I don't even know where to start about what I don't like about this book.  Before starting this book, Ms. Picoult should have spent a little more time researching laws and procedure regarding kidnappings, especially proceedings following such a great span of time. I'll be the first to admit that I don't know much about law, but it seems quite unrealistic that Delia's father Andrew Hopkins (or should I say Charles Matthews?) would be placed in maximum security prison in a matter of a week. I find it hard to believe that on his first day, he would get beaten and practically raped (I can't remember if he was or not). I could be wrong, but if 28 years have passed, wouldn't the statute of limitations passed, and even if they hadn't, wouldn't the mother need to press charges in order for anything to happen? And wouldn't it mean something that they were in a different state?  Now, even though everyone else seemed to love her, Delia was incredibly annoying (and the actress who read her "monologues" in the audio version was equally annoying). Women authors tend to make their female protagonists characters that supposedly have a lot of depth that usually have several men in love with her. I have seen many women in real life who pretend that they have this effect on men, but rarely ever do. It just seems like a fantasy of Picoults, and a very boring one at that. Ah, a love triangle, gee, like THAT's never been done before. One instance that sticks out is when Delia gets upset that Eric (her fiancee and her fathers attorney) doesn't tell her about a court appearing, however, Eric didn't even find out until ten minutes before it was about to happen. But, even the premise for that is questionable: would that really happen? I mean seriously!  I also hated how the book shifted "voices" -- this is not a play, I don't want to read monologues describing the same events from a different perspective. I didn't feel as though it was necessary to divide this book into several characters. I half expected a chapter to be from Sophie (Delia's four year old daughter) perspective. I could really do without the exaggerated and unrealistic jail scenes or the indian lore. I also hated how the entire book seemed to be composed of different memories or thoughts that really made no sense, and then later incorporated into the passage, also not making sense. For example, Eric narrates this dream he had about Sondra, who is some beautiful girl he imagined. She turns into a rabbit and runs into a bush. Later, Ruthann tells a story about a rabbit that shoots the sun with a bow and arrow and causes the earth to burn up. Somehow he connects the two because of the rabbit, when really they have no cohesive connection. Also, between the three childhood friends (Delia, Eric and Fitz) they talk about their memories constantly, as if that is the only thing that binds them together. Real friendships don't compromise of only discussing things that happened to them in the past... but it does in this book, because the author so desperately wants you to know that they are a really close group of friends. To me, it just seems pretentious.  What's also pretentious is the various passages that are supposed to reveal some new idea about life but really make no sense at all. One passage I remember is when Delia is talking to Fitz about memories and she suggests that maybe everyone has the same memories already in the head from when they are born, and maybe they remember things that never happened to them. I might have that a little wrong, because it's a bit confusing. It's confusing because it makes absolutely no sense. It doesn't even feel like it's remotely TRYING to make sense at all! The book is full of little things like this that just feel pseudo-intellectual, like Picoult is forcing her characters to have depth when they really want to be stereotypical.  All of the characters seem a little edgy and totally basket cases. Delia gets incredibly upset for not remembering what her life was when she was FOUR YEARS OLD. For goodness sakes woman, I have maybe 2 or 3 memories from when I was four years old or younger, and most of them don't make sense except for the fact that I know what my parents have told me. By the way she acts, you'd think she was 12 when she was kidnapped.  Also, she seems to recover memories all the time... man, I wish I could do that. It just seems a bit implausible, that's all.  The book is saturated in gooey, sappy imagery, metaphors, anecdotes, memories, subplots, and so on. I am not so quick to totally bash an author, but it's this type of pretentious writernese dribble that I loathe. If I wanted some sappy, melodramatic dimestore paperback I would have read one of those instead. I expected better from the synopsis on the back cover. Overall, and I say overall without even finishing the book (I haven't even gotten to the meth lab part with the father yet, but it sounds pretty ridiculous), that this is definitely one of the most horrible books I've ever read, bar none. Do yourself a favor and skip this one... and definitely don't pick up the audiobook. The voice actors and actresses are incredibly annoying to listen to+books
"dummies" r the best+P+I learn so much from these books-have about6 different ones. The index in this is the best to look up anything you want to know about taking care-good care of your dog+books
Awesome book+P+I bought this for my daughter who wants to go into forensics & she said she can't put it down!!!  She really likes it & it gets into the very things she wants to study about+books
Pure fun!+P+"Valley of the Dolls" is pure fun. It's got great characters--from the small town girl trying to make it in the big city to the actress who needs to feel real to the singer who wants it all. Reading this, I was reminded of today's soap operas and also other novels of this genre. It was, for me, a fun read, though sometimes a little dark. It's an older book but I think it's withstood the test of time. I definitely recommned it, along with "Take Your Shirt Off" or anything by Jackie Collins. +books
Beautiful+P+One of the best novels I have ever read.  This book has everything a good read should:  characters that become real to the reader, a wonderful sense of place, a sense of history and knowledge.  Not only do you get completely wrapped up in the world of Vine Sullivan, but you also learn more about yourself in the process.  A truly beautiful book that I can't recommend highly enough.  I've bought a copy for everyone I love+books
disappointed+N+Lewis' qualifications as mid-east scholar sound impressive but I was disappointed by this book.  Although interesting, some of the essays are indicative of senility.  The title says "interpreting" so I will allow him creative license. Expect to find the kind of stuff you would look for in Stalin's treatise on the U.S. Constitution+books
Blue Light+N+Walter Mosley is normally a detective writer, known for his Easy Rawlins stories. Blue Light is a diversion into a genre that would fall somewhere between science fiction and new age. Various people in northern California are zapped with a blue light that makes them weird. According to the book's cover flap, the light brings out the potential of any person it strikes. However in the book it simply magnifies their existing personality. A smart girl becomes really smart, a young girl with quick reflexes becomes something of a ninja, and a promiscuous wife becomes a sex goddess. Mr Mosley is a talented writer. His prose and some of his action sequences makes this book readable. Unfortunately there's little balance between good and evil, which is problematic since the whole second half of the book is one long buildup of suspense towards a final apocalyptic encounter. Even more unfortunate is the fact the long awaited encounter is tedious and uninteresting. There's a few great and captivating scenes in this book, but otherwise extremely little to recommend itself+books
Team Rodent: How Disney Devours the World+N+This book really puts into perspective the way Disney handles its affairs, especially relating to merchandising their name.  I appreciate Carl Hiaasen's humor and point of view.  And he is right when he points out that people tend to trust the Disney name no matter what+books
This is where I came in...+P+Stormy Weather was the first Hiaasen novel I read. I picked up a paperback copy at a remainder sale. Never heard the name of the guy and didn't expect much; but it was cheap, and so...  Boy, was I wrong! Since then I have made sure that I read every Hiaasen in and out of print, and I'm about to catch up on some of his real old stuff. His writings opened up the world of the writers and the universe of that nook of America called 'Florida', which is about as whacky and demented as it comes. Actually, I've _been_ to Florida, though not down to the Keys; but it's amazing what you miss when you basically just pass through or dip in and out of it. No wonder Piers Anthony used it as the setting for a bunch his, firmly tongue-in-cheek, fantasy novels.   Stormy Weather, to get back to the subject, piled on charcaters I'll never be likely to forget, from the skull-juggling Augustine to the simply impossible 'Skink'. A never-ending litany of ascerbically presented character sketches and Hiaasen's usual--entirely justified!--tirade and caricature of venal politicians, environmental rape and greed; plus some truly and honestly _stupid_ people.  Fun and games and I never looked back. There are other 'Florida' writers I've come to like, especially James Hall and Laurence Shames. Depending on my mood, I sometimes like them better than Hiaasen, especially Laurence Shames. All three of them offer different perspectives on life in and beyond that strange place called 'Florida'. As I said, it depends on my mood. Hiaasen usually ends up at the top when I'm in a 'South Park' disposition; needing satire with heart. And I need some more of that now and soon and please!

Not as Good as Accidental Tourist+N+I read this book after being enchanted by the Accidental Tourist and other  of Anne Tyler's books.  This book deals with the life of a depressed  teenage girl and unless that kind of thing interest you, I would not  recommend reading it.  On the up side, it's really short so you can get  through it rather quickly.  I was hoping to read a good book, but only felt  worse after finishing this one+books

Needs Editing+N+This is a fast-paced book with all the formulaic elements required of a political thriller. Nothing here particularly surprised me. I would guess that if you have enjoyed Mr. Flynn's other works you will enjoy this one as well.  Mr. Flynn needs a more assertive editor. His use of language is so sloppy as to distract a reasonably sensitive reader from the finer points of the story. This probably isn't detrimental to the reader's comprehension, but it is irritatng.  Finally, one very minor quibble: non-standard spellings are used throughout (such as "harken" rather than "hearken"). This may or may not matter to any given reader, but I found it to be worthy of mention+books
Unendurable +N+This book was on somebody's Amazon.com LISTMANIA for Sea Turtles, so I hunted it down.  It is only vaguely about sea turtles, in that it is set on an island in Georgia where sea turtles nest.  There is a sea turtle biologist introduced at the very beginning of the book, and then he disappears, so it's obvious that he was involved in the crime.   There are way too many characters in this book to keep track of and most of them are not believable or likable.  I wish this book had at least been fun to read but it was tedious and I ended up skimming the whole thing, looking for any sign of sea turtle interaction.  Skip this book and send your $6.99 to a sea turtle hospital instead.+books
A Better Movie then a Book+N+I was looking forward to reading The Exorcist but I was let down. The book is boring it doesn't go into any real depth when it comes  to characters. The movie surpasses the book, I feel asleep while reading this book. Some people may feel that this book is scary but its only scary if you scare easily.  +books
English Education majors and secondary English Teachers: check this out!+P+This text helped me to articulate the 'principles' of Standard English by examining our language in all its varieties scientifically and intuitively.  Such articulation necessates a thorough understanding of the notions of descriptive vs. prescriptive, standard vs. nonstandard, formal vs. informal, grammatical vs. ungrammatical, and constitutive vs. regulative.  This introductory text is written for the mature student who has  had little or no background in linguistics or traditional school grammar. Consequently, the authors begin by demonstrating how traditional grammar instruction with its eight parts of speech and semantic definitions falls terribly short of accounting for the many rule exceptions and illogicalities of langauge.   I highly recommend this text for English Education majors and secondary school English teachers.+books
take a different class+N+After a semester using the text i have come to the conclusion that the authors, Brehm, Kassin, and Fein, leave more questions then answers and that their sub-par sense of humor is more then just a waste of money.  After reading certain sections i get the feeling that the authors do not clearly understand the issue at hand, but rather throw 15 different research studies at the topic covering their uncertainty and topping it off with a dire attempt at a joke leaving the reader completely ambiguous+books

The Home Organizing workbook, by Meryl Starr+P+&quot;Clearing your Clutter&quot;  as Meryl Starr so wonderfully says, is a great step by step method that enables a person to take the right approach without getting overwelmed by the task in sight.

"You will be haunted by this story ..."+P+I've just finished page 341, the last page. It's midnight here in these Connemara hills and I can't rest. I'm unsettled. I need to write something about this book. But what? Do I love it? Do I hate it? In the beginning I felt like quitting after every ten pages, then continuing after the next ten pages, and so on, and so on. I felt myself both repulsed and seduced. Eventually I gave in. Gave in to Nick Flynn's words, sentences, story, language, world, universe. The universe of Nick Flynn's disfunctional family: his alcoholic, delusional, absentee father and his suicidal mother, form the foundation of this memoir. In large measure it's a journey in search of his father, a man who lives by his wits, fuelled by alcohol, driven by the delusion/fear of writing the 'Great American Novel' (with a million dollar advance and the Nobel prize certainties in that delusion), to eventual homelessness on the street. It's also Nick Flynn is search of himself. But it's none of the above. It's truly a work of literature that sets out, on every page, to capture, and lose, the mystery of the human condition. It's surreal, a glimpse at a parallel universe that we may all be living. This book finds a kinship with Joyce and Beckett, and it's no wonder that Nick Flynn chooses an excerpt from Beckett's 'Endgame' to open the story: HAMM: Scoundrel! Why did you engender me? NAGG: I don't know. HAMM: What? Why didn't you know? NAGG: That it'd be you.   You will be haunted by this story long after you've finished reading it. +books

why a classic?+N+I figured if Oprah wanted America to read this book that it couldn't be too bad. I had held out on reading Faulkner, and now I know why. I read alot and love reading but this book, and "As I Lay Dying" makes me question why oh why Faulkner is a classic. My hypothesis is that its so unapproachable therefore people think it must be brilliant. This is a good book for english class when you can sit around and discuss the meanings of it all and read sparknotes together. This is not a book for sitting at home and reading for yourself. If you want to know the story just go read the sparknotes version. The book itself is too hard to figure out and there is little plot. its just a long headache really.+books
Possitive and Incouraging+P+I am about half way through the book and I have been greatly encouraged by it.  When I am feeling down and read it it gives me some renewed strength.  I am personally a realist and reality can get you down.  I am from Katrina Ville which has been mentally challenging.  It was hard loosing our home, business location and a lot of friends.  Although I was fully insured and we are doing well the realization that you can loose it all so fast is depressing.  So many that have gone through it are not even as fortunate as I am.  So many around the world would love to trade places with me.  I am reading this one slowly and trying to absorb as much as I can.  Joel Osteen has been able to reach me with his positive message when others just couldn't.  I want to read it again when I am finished+books
Joel gives fuel to the empty soul+P+I read this book within 4 hours on a flight. It really changed my perspective on life and how to put a painful past behind me. I have bought at least 10 books for my friends whom are going through some very trying times. I can't speak for them but I know it's altered their lives and thinking.  It's an easy read book you won't want to put down+books
A Must Have for the Mystery Connoisseur!+P+This is a wonderful tool to keep track of all those mystery books on your shelves. This book offers a comprehensive listing of women's fiction mysteries. Books are listed by author and title. It is great way to see the  order of books written in a series. There is also a check list where you  can check off the book once you purchase it, and then check it after you  read it. I like to make notations next to the books once I finish the book.  Books that have been nominated or received awards are designated with a  star by the title+books

Neoconservatism isn't conservatism, or the answer+P+"Neoconservatives were the boat people of the McGovern revolution that was itself the political vehicle of the moral, social, and cultural revolutions of the 1960s."  A key to understanding neoconservatism is that it is not a sibling or an "update" of traditional conservatism. To see it that way will only mislead you. Neoconservatism's roots have sprouted from the left more than the right. The current GOP "may be Reaganite in its tax policy, but it is Wilsonian in its foreign policy, FDR in its trade policy, and LBJ all the way in its spending policies. Pragmatism is the order of the day. The Republican philosophy might be summarized thus: "To hell with principle; what matters is power, and that we have it, and that they do not."  But when one becomes one's enemy, who won?  Conservatives are nationalists. Neoconservatives are internationalists. Conservatives are protectionists. Neoconservatives are free traders. Conservatives see the culture war as essential. Neoconservatives see it as a distraction. Conservatives believe in defending the land militarily and project our ideals by example. Neoconservatives believe in defending it offensively and projecting our ideals by force.  The neoconservatives and presidential candidate George W. Bush were a match on domestic policy in 2000 (Bush didn't propose a single spending cut in his campaign), but it appears that they hijacked his foreign policy, whatever it used to be. (Given the events of his presidency, it's a startling reminder that this same president couldn't name four world leaders when he was quizzed during the 2000 campaign.) That foreign policy was the defense and advancement of world democracy, something that has never been America's aim. The only proactive foreign policy we've ever had was the Truman Doctrine, a stance we took when the Soviet menace showed itself to be aggressive and a real threat to the United States, our allies, and our real interests. The Clinton interventions, misguided as they were, were at least brief and limited, nothing that risked expansion into a long-term, regional conflict. The same cannot be said of Iraq.  Mr. Buchanan gives a chapter-length history of Islam and Europe, setting the scene for 9/11. The following war in Afghanistan was just and necessary, and quite a diplomatic masterpiece, one that could have been the foundations for better relations with the Middle East, which had shown considerable support for our efforts against al Qaeda. Iran, an al Qaeda enemy, voluntarily offered help in Afghanistan, but Bush soon after named it among the "axis of evil". The neocons had attached their agenda to the unclear war on terror to advance a war on Iraq, a war that the neocons had pursued for years, and to be followed with a frightening series of wars throughout the region. The war on terror evolved into a quest for worldwide democracy, buffered with a moral imperative that our diseased culture violates in almost every way, and with the unrealistic belief that the Middle East wants democracy, even though they've never chosen it themselves. Mr. Buchanan also offers a study of terrorism, and what a touchy thing it is: the weapon of the weak, the reaction to empire, the stuff of martyrdom.  With new bases in central Asia, the invasion of Iraq, and talk of much more war, the neocons were starting to frighten the world. China, now surrounded by U.S. bases, began building and tailoring its military for our encirclement, and leading the all-offense neocons to believe that war with them could be expected, even though their going to war with us would have been suicide. China wasn't just preparing for us: it was reacting to us. The neocons were reacting to a world of their own making: filled with nations that wouldn't war with us if they were democratic. This is utterly divorced from conservatism, historic American foreign policy, and moral, Constitutional, and realistic restraint. Perhaps it's for the best in the long term that Iraq didn't turn out; that madness seems to be coming to an end. Even the neocons seem to believe that failure is now an option.  Mr. Buchanan then turns to the domestic issues: the disaster of free trade, the continuance of big government, and the imperial judiciary. However, about all you'll find is that neoconservatives are a problem in the sense that they're not the solution. Cultural issues have given them plenty of chances to fight and solidify their base, but they've been silent, and often quick to fund whatever nonsense demanded funding to keep the issue from open debate and away from the hands of the Democrats. Neoconservatives seem to have concluded that big government gets votes, and that social issues are a distraction. But the culture war truly began with the horrid Warren court, while Congress didn't use its Constitutional power to hold it back. The neoconservative GOP seems too focused on bad foreign and economic policy to be concerned with the judicial usurpation of power it wasn't meant to have. Neoconservatism hasn't corrected wrongs; it has created more of them.  I was hoping for some answers to an overall question I've had about neoconservatism: where is all of this going? How do massive debts get paid when spending is out of control and manufacturing is sent overseas? Where does peace begin after perpetual war? Mr. Buchanan doesn't offer anything here but the question. Perhaps that's for the neocons themselves. Perhaps even they don't know.  "Where the Right Went Wrong" could be the prequel to "State of Emergency" in that this book is a good summary of Bush's first term, whereas the latter defines the pressing issue of the second. However, this book includes an afterward, written in early 2005, summarizing the voters' response to the electric 2004 election, and defining the battle lines within the GOP between traditional conservatives and neoconservatives, the fighting between which began almost as soon as the 2004 returns were in+books
poetry in Riis' How he oher half Lives+N+How the Other Half Lives was written over a century ago as an expose' of the appalling living conditions in the tenements of New York City. The author speaks with a crusader's zeal and with so much detail that the reader can visualize these tenements, these streets, and these people as if they were living today. This is a grim and moving portrayal of the lives of the men, the women and the children that inhabit these loathsome neighborhoods of New York City in the late 1800s.  He so graphically describes the filth, the sunless and airless rooms, the crowding, and the starvation that these places palpably exist for the reader and bring a chill to any heart.  Riis has a genuine concern for the tenement situation and understands these people's plight. His pictures are touching and meant to vividly show their misery. He, for the most part, blames the money-hungry landlords for these crowded conditions: "How shall the love of God be understood by those who have been nurtured in sight only of the greed of man." (p. 266). He laments that the tenement is three quarters responsible for the misery of the poor. Then, after his extensive discourse, he offers three concrete cures for these dreadful conditions, something that many authors forget when they are enlightening readers.  Riis states his purpose for writing this book himself on page 297 when he says, "If this book shall have borne ever so feeble a hand in garnering a harvest of justice, it has served its purpose." The author apparently succeeded with his purpose, because in the flyleaf of this book the publisher tells us: "This book helped bring about new revisions in the housing codes of the major U. S. cities." How does this book relate to adult education? By moving chronologically from the founding of America to the slums of NYC in the 1800s, are we to understand that education took a back seat to the accumulation of money during those hundred years? Certainly Riis posits that education is one of the solutions to this problem while at the same time implying that wealth accumulation and the lack of education has been the cause of this problem.  "Thus the whole matter resolves itself once more into a question of education, all the more urgent because these people are poor, miserably poor almost to a man." (p. 147). He does not forget that this "education" is not only for the poor people, but also for the wealthy landlords. "Clearly, it is a matter of education on the part of the landlord no less than the tenant." (p. 270). Riis' almost missionary language exhorts us to never allow greed to override a compassion for humanity.  "It is a fight in which eternal vigilance is truly the price of liberty and the preservation of society." (p. 233). The relation of this book to the other units of study in this course could be explained as an example of how low mankind can descend if education is not considered one of the major cornerstones of a society. Although this book was exhaustive in its detail, it was easy to read while at the same time enlightening. I found myself enjoying the ranting tone and the fascinating lists of neighborhoods and the labels that Riis used for the different races. In a sense it reads like a Ginsberg poem; constantly hitting the reader with melodious lists of places and people from another era. Read these geographic names out loud and feel their rhythm: Jewtown, Bandit's Roost, Double Alley, The Bowery, The Bloody Sixth Ward, The Fourth, Fifth and Tenth Wards,  Blindman's Alley, The Bend, The Battery, Little Italy, The French Quarter, Hell's Kitchen, The West Side, Bottle Alley, Frog Hollow, Poverty Gap, Murderer's Alley, Gotham Court, The Old Brewery, Old Africa, Potter's Field, Blackwell's Island Asylum, Rogues' Gallery, Penitentiary Row, Chinatown. The list goes on. To someone reared in rural America, this chant sounds like a song about another country.   Riis also has something to say about all the races of people that live in the tenements of New York City:  Chinaman (he can't be taught), (Chinese (coolie--laundry business), Polish Jew (coops himself up in his den with his thermometer at boiling), Russian Jew, Jew (money is their God), Bohemian (poor, but thrifty), Blacks (like to gamble, but they are clean), Greek, Hebrews (tailors, all of them), Dutchman, Irish (like to drink and have expensive funerals), German (order loving), Swiss, Pasquales, Russian, Italian (a born gambler; lighthearted and gay), Swamp Angel (thieves), Street Arabs (army of homeless boys), Tramps and Toughs (the world owes them a living),and the Celtics. I was enthralled by the street lingo and the colloquialisms and Riis' comments about every race.  I noticed one interesting similarity between the late 1800s and the present day. Riis says that the gap between the social classes is widening everyday. I hear people talking about the growing differences between the rich and the poor often these days. Does every generation think that is happening in their time?  Not only should this book be used by people researching New York City`s tenements, but it should also be read by everyone seeking a blueprint for social change. It is a reminder to show us how hopeless the human circumstances can become when man's greed overrides his concern for human dignity.    +books
Insulting to anyone with intelligence+N+I have to admit, I have forced myself to listen to Michael Weiner's abortion of a talkshow more than once.In a way it's almost humorous, until you stop to think that so many people in this country not only take this man seriously, they view him as a deep political thinker. He is not.He is an ignorant, homophobic, sexist, racist little subhuman troll. An insult to true, honest-to-God old-fashioned American conservatism. William F. Buckley Jr he ain't. What this is the rantings of a deeply psychologically disturbed individual. One would find more insightful comments at your state's mental hospital, or by a survey of several of your town's homeless population. I can't wait for the day when Savage, Limbaugh, Hannity, O'Reilly AND their counterparts on the left Moore, Franken, Janeane Garafolo and the rest are off the air and languishing in the obscurity that they so deserve. Or even better, we could get NASA to get cracking on building the first solar lander, and have them put these windbags on it. The average IQ of the nation would increase, and perhaps we would then be able to listen to REAL political discourse, instead of a bunch of ignorant, partisan loudmouths with an agenda screaming at one another.+books
OK for the beginner - but even then not that great+N+I was given this book for free by the owner of a bookstore when I told him that that I was starting a bookstore.     I learned maybe, oh, 5 or 6 things that were slightly important.  I especially learned how radically the bookmarket has changed in such a short period of time, and how mired in the past this book is (even with it's new chapter on the Internet).   In any business, there will always be a middle man- but the face of the middleman in the book business is so changed that it is tough to write a book that stays current.   For the young bucks starting in the industry, do subject and content searches of discussion boards hosted by the big bookselling pages: amazon.com (most useful), and abe.com.  Getting a part time job doing grunt work (shelving, cleaning) at a local used bookstore will provide you with more practical education in a day than this book will. +books
GREAT overview-awful editing &amp; proofreading+N+As previous reviewers have commented, this is a very good overview of the CMMI. The authors work in the industry, and have done an admirable job presenting the nuts-and-bolts of this enormous topic in a straightforward fashion. But if you intend to use it as a tool, like you would Paulk's book on the SW-CMM (SM), DON'T BUY IT YET. The editing in Appendix B renders this book useless to me (I need it as a tool). When I compare the constituents of the Process Areas in Appendix B to the CMMI (CMU/SEI-2000-TR-018), there is erroneous duplication. E.g., &quot;Commitment&quot; in PMC reads exactly like &quot;Commitment&quot; in Requirements Management PA (it shouldn't !). Ditto for Co in SAM, Co in MA, and the subsequent Maturity Level 2 Process Area commitments. The same erroneous cut-and-paste was made for the Abilities, DI, etc. The Level 3 PAs have the similar problem, erroneous cut-and-pastes from the RD template. I cannot use this book as I'd intended because of these errors, so I have to lug around the large heavy SEI tech reports instead+books
Buyer Beware (Note: Taijiquan = Tai Chi Chuan = Taiji)+N+If you're familiar with the writings of Wong Kiew Kit he often states that you can't learn genuine martial arts like Taijiquan and Shaolin Kung Fu from a book.  You need to learn from a master because there are too many subtleties that will be missed without a proper instructor.  So when Wong Kiew Kit states that:   "I have no Taijiquan lineage. I did not learn from any well-known living Taijiquan masters. I mainly learned from Taijiquan classics, and was able to interpret and practice what past masters had written because of my thorough Shaolin training."  http://wongkk.com/answers/ans04b/jul04-1.html  Which is similar to saying:  "I have no Shaolin lineage. I did not learn from any well-known living Shaolin masters. I mainly learned from Shaolin classics, and was able to interpret and practice what past masters had written because of my thorough Taijiquan training."  There's no way Wong Kiew Kit would tolerate someone claiming to be a master of Shaolin Kung Fu without having learned from a teacher belonging to a lineage.  On his website he states that:  "Not a single person of those who have learnt Taijiquan from me complains about my lack of a Taijiquan lineage. In fact, no one seems to care about this lineage issue. On the other hand, they are satisfied that what they have leant(sic) from me is very close to the kind of Taijiquan practiced by masters in the past."  http://wongkk.com/answers/ans02b/dec02-3.html  How are these people qualified to gauge how closely Wong Kiew Kit's Taiji compares to Taijiquan masters of the past?   Did they time travel and study under these past masters?  Or do they have a gut feeling like I have a gut feeling that I can learn Shaolin Kung Fu from a Taiji instructor?  It's quite likely that WKK is teaching a modified version of Shaolin Kung Fu that uses Taiji principles gleaned from his interpretation of the classics.    I won't deny that Wong Kiew Kit is probably Shaolin master, but there's no evidence to suggest that he is teaching an authentic form of Taiji.  He has admitted that his entire knowledge of Taijiquan has mainly come from books and scriptures, not from a living breathing human being trained in a proper lineage.  Call it whatever you want to WKK, but don't mislead people into thinking its Taijiquan.  Telling people to learn from masters and not from books and then doing it yourself is completley hypocritical.    In the end, of what value is a "Tai Chi Chuan" book that was written by someone who has no real "Tai Chi Chuan" training?  In response to a new review, let me mention a few things:  One reviewer presupposes that Taiji branched off from Shaolin, but there's so much debate about the origins of Taiji its to hard to make any concrete statements about it.   The Wikipedia page on Zhang Sanfeng states that:   "Much of the written material about him is mythical, contradictory, or otherwise suspect. For instance, he is reported by different people to have been born either in 960, 1247, or in 1279."  There's almost no proof to suggest that he actually existed, or that he created Taiji out of Shaolin.  But what tends to be agreed upon is that all forms of Taiji branched off from Chen Style when Yang Lu-Chan learned the art and spread his version of Taiji (Yang Style) across China.     This reviewer and his master may have proper training in a Taiji, and I won't contest that, but as WKK explicitly states, he has none.  He seems to mistake WKK's lack of proper instruction from a Taiji master as modesty.  If  "modesty" is what you are looking for in a teacher, may I too be "modest" about my lack of proper instruction in Shaolin, and offer you my instruction; perhaps even a book about something that I have no proper instruction in.        WKK does state that you should not learn Taiji without a proper instructor, but he himself did just that.  Maybe he could provide us with the origins of his undistinguished lineage to settle the argument?    When the reviewer says that the Shaolin Temple is the "supreme martial arts college throughout all of Buddhist China's history," it really is just a matter of opinion.  Not everyone views the Shaolin Temple in such a holy light.  Everything WKK writes in his books about the history of martial arts, the Shaolin temple and Buddhism ends up supporting his qualifications as a teacher; which is a major conflict of interest.  All the legends about Bodhidharma and Zhang Sanfeng are stated as fact without being prefaced with a warning about the highly mythical nature of their history.  He uses the iffy Taiji developing from Shaolin story to justify his lack of Taiji lineage.  If you were a prospective customer you would be highly discouraged by the whole no-lineage thing.  But when he feeds you the Taiji developing from Shaolin stuff the reader thinks, "If Taiji developed from Shaolin, WKK must be a Master of both."  WKK sounds pretty great if he is the one writing the history books+books
Don't Bother with this one+N+Life is too short to be spent reading drivel.  Stuart Woods was really off the mark with this book.  You shouldn't rest on your laurels Mr. Woods, your audience deserves better.  I've enjoyed your past books very much, but this one left a lot to be desired.  I was very put off by Stone Barrington's bed-hopping activities in this story.  With Arrington (mother of his son) one night, then with Holly the next, I don't recall him being quite that indescriminate in other books.  The plot was relly silly and contrived, it must have been that the publisher was pressing for a story, never mind quality.  Don't waste your money on this one+books

Rightwing hack spouts economic drivel+N+The only thing Milton Friedman has going for himself is that he says out loud what other reactionaries will only whisper.   Ayn Rand would have loved Friedman's disdain for the poor--for anyone, in fact, lacking the "initiative" famously shown in a 1963 cartoon in which Barry Goldwater stands in front of a poor person in a Southwest ghetto and says, "Why don't you show some initiative? Why don't you go out and inherit a department store like I did."  If you think the status quo was ordained by God, or that capitalism is the best that humanity can come up with, this book is for you. If not, start reading Trotsky, Lenin, and all the people with vision, compassion, and utter disgust for the sad mess that the fat cats have made of this planet.  +books

Too many errors and a typical neo-confederate bias of author+N+I bought this book on the recommendation of several people that I know pretty well, unfortunately, this book is filled with errors upon errors and is filled with a typical neo-confederate bias by the author.  In fact, the book should be called "How confederates saved America" as he gives the credit for the peaceful return of the confederate armies to confederate generals such as Lee, Johnson and Forrest, rather than on Lincoln's instructions to Grant and Sherman and generous terms known as the River Queen Doctrine, "I want no one punished; treat them liberally  all around.  We want those people to return to their allegieance to the United States and submit to the laws".  His errors are numerous.  He talks of the possibility of the confederates disbanding their armies and moving into the hills and waging a guerilla warfare against the US troops and sights examples of how successful this tactic has been throughout time and he includes in these examples the American Revolution.  He states that Francis Marion, Thomas Sumter and Andrew Pickens(who all could be called partisans or guerilla fighters), but then he goes on to state that Nathaniel Greene was a guerilla fighter as well.  Now only someone completely ignorant of US Army history could ever make such a statement.  Nathaniel Greene served in the Continental Army and was the Quartermaster General, he was in no way a guerilla, nor did he use guerilla tactics.  He continues on that Greene used guerilla tactics in battle at Kings Mountain and Cowpens and Guilford Courthouse.  Besides the basic fact that Greene wasn't even at the battles of Kings Mountain and Cowpens, neither one could be said to be guerilla attacks.  At Kings Mountain, the American militia found Patrick Ferguson and his men well entrenched in defenses at the crest of the mountain and formed up and attacked the positions, hardly a guerilla tactic. Cowpens was fought by Daniel Morgan and was a set piece battle where he destroyed Tarleton's legion.  Greene attacked Cornwallis at Guilford Courthouse in another set piece battle and was winning until Cornwallis took the extreme measure of firing canister directly into the center of the two massed armies, killing and wounding as many of his own men as he did Americans.  None of these battles were guerilla fighting and Greene in no way can be called a guerilla.  The author shows his neo-confederate bias most clearly by restating the apocryphal stories of rape, theft and outright murder by Sherman's troops during the Savannah and Carolina Campaigns as matter of historical facts.  He continually paints the Federals in the worst of lights, while reserving his highest praise and most eloquent prose for the confederates.  He incorrectly quotes Sherman when he claims Sherman said "Sherman himself explained that in his march, he inflicted an astonishing $100 million worth of damage, of which only $20 million was necessary, the rest being "simply waste and destruction"".  He clearly is slanting his own words to convince people that Sherman was in fact "the devil" as the neo-cons believe he is.  Unfortunately, what he CLAIMS Sherman said has no relation to what he actually said.  From the Official Records, Vol 44, page 13; in Sherman's report on his campaign to the War Dept, he states "I estimate the damage done to the State of Georgia and its military resources at $100,000,000; at least, $20,000,000 of which has inured to our advantage, and the remainder is simple waste and destruction."  Sherman does not, as Mr. Winik claims state that only $20 million was necessary, what Sherman said was that his army confiscated and USED(inured means to use) $20 million worth of the property and destroyed the remaining $80 million of confederate civilian and private property that was going to be used against the armed forces of the United States.  If you are a confederate "lost causer" then you will enjoy this novel, however, if you are looking for historical truth, then you should read a different book.  William Hal+books
Awful book!+N+I would give this book less than one star if that were possible. After reading the reviews, I eagerly ordered "Trust" and anticipated reading it.   Well....I read it and what a waste of time.  Stilted, unnatural dialogue and narration, a spoon-fed simplistic plot, robotic and one-dimensional characters, and clunky vocabulary usage made this book one of the worst I have read in many years.  The sentences "He stared into her eyes" and "He placed his hand on her shoulder" appeared four times in the space of six pages; then for good measure, the author throws them in several more times later in the book.  There is no context given; what do they imply--a threat, a romantic interest?  The writing is consistently shallow and superficial and the author sums up  and reviews the simple plot developments every two or three chapters as if the reader couldn't possibly remember what is happening from one page to the next.  In my case, perhaps that was true because  the poor writing and puppet-like characters that behaved inconsistently were laughably distracting.  I forced myself to finish the book and was just as bored and incredulous at the end as when I began.  Did the author self publish this book?  Please, sir, go to writing school and get an editor+books
Refreshing & Wonderful+P+I actually listened to the audio book read by the author. She does a great job as a reader which usually isn't the case when an author reads her own work, in my experience.   It's great to read about someone's lovely and loving childhood for a change, and it's not boring! Far from it. I laughed out loud, and cried from being moved by beauty instead of tragedy. Don't miss this one+books
O'Nan rights a wrong..........+P+Stewart O'Nan has corrected a major oversight by writing so comprehensively about a topic surrounded by myth and folk legend. Apparently, the story of the Hartford circus fire of 1944 has never been told in a book, but Mr O'Nan has dived into the deep end of the myths and legends and surfaced with a factual, well-researched, and eminently readable tale of the tragedy. Covering all aspects of the fire and its' aftermath, Mr O'Nan debunks the stories told as truth but bearing none, reveals new and unsung heroes, and lovingly examines the fate of Little Miss 1565, the lovely, unclaimed child who lay so long in a grave with only a number to mark her presence.  This is an exciting read, filled with the thrill of the circus, the horror of a fire out of control, the fate of survivors, and that of victims ....... both those who lived and those who didn't.  While Mr O'Nan has moved on to the Boston Red Sox in his book with Stephen King, FAITHFUL, this was his first foray into non-fiction, and he has done himself proud. This is a great story, told well, and with care+books
It's Not THAT Bad...Then Again, It's Not Too Good Either. +N+If this is your first Barbara Taylor Bradford book, you may never pick up another one.  I, on the other hand, like to give an author the three strikes rule, so won't hesitate to try something else, but it won't be very soon.  If you want to read one of her novels, do NOT start with this one like I did.  This is very boring--like snails serving as soap stars--not to mention slow and predictable.  I listened to the entire thing on cd, but think it was mostly because I liked Ms. O'Karma's narration--she has an appealingly smokey voice like Carolyn Jones from the Adams Family.  It still couldn't save this story with its endless self-serving "what-about-ME!" mantras and Valentine's overly moralistic attitude.  I'm the same way, and I bore myself!  You knew from page one where this story was going, and the dialog was as insufferable as the descriptions of everything from food and clothing to moths reproducing on peeling wallpaper.  "I was a war photographer and my mommy was mean to me" resounds every other page, yet she wants to get away from all of that.  Nothing's worse than a character or real person who brags, then turns around and screams "Look at me, look at me...How DARE you look at me?!" +books
Refund Requested+N+I have read all four of Sarah Vowell's books. I believe that is all of them. I thoroughly enjoyed three of them and would strongly recommend them. With for Radio On, her first book, she seems to be in a different place. Radio On is a diary of Sarah listening to the radio. Although the concept is interesting, the result is a lot of very short entries in which there is little opportunity to develop anything. But the real reason I didn't like Radio On is because of Sarah's perspective at that time. She is a very critical person in this book. Nirvana is the greatest band ever, and The Grateful Dead is worthless. Whether it is music, politics, or a variety of other topics, you get the clear impression that her opinion is right and any others are wrong. Radio On is a very mean and negative view of life and our world. The worst case scenario, though, is someone reads Radio On first and doesn't read Sarah Vowell's other books. That would be huge mistake+books
Big Useless Book for a COMPUTER-BASED Exam+N+Do not be fooled by the lure of "six full length model tests." The tests are in paper form. Barron's is a very paper-heavy book. You will get more practice through Kaplan's test prep as they have many computer-based exams+books
Predictable+N+I read the back cover of this book and immediately knew most of what would happen.  As soon as I met the character who would turn out to be the driver, I knew the rest of the story.  It was extremely easy to figure out and quite disappointing.  The story's decent.  The text flows nicely, and the suspension of disbelief is strong, but where did Nick's originality go?  Where's the sweet and innocent charm of The Notebook, A Walk to Remember, and Nights in Rodanthe?  It seems like he's run out of steam, or didn't care too much about this one.  A decent book to read, but don't expect anything spectacular as you would with his earlier work+books
Not impressed by any means+N+Ok, I like to be scared.  I like good ol' traditional scary stuff!  This book was just (for the most part) weird! The tales were weird, the author comments were weird, and most of the stories were pathetic.  I mean, some of them were definitely worth the read, but it's not worth the fifteen bucks this book costs.  Used, five bucks, MAYBE, but I would strongly suggest spending your money elsewhere--I'll let you know when I run across an anthology worth fifteen bucks, but it isn't this one+books
Dreadful plot, nice dialogue+N+This is meant to be a mystery, but one can deduce the entire plot in almost the first couple of chapters.  Then it gets boring waiting and waiting for the rest of the characters to stumble over it!  A couple of the sub-plot characters (Regina & Lucy especially) are nothing more than boring caricatures. I was very disappointed in the whole satan worshiping mumbo jumbo mystery - doesn't seem like something Jane Austen would need to prop up her books. That said, the dialogue and general writing is great.  I really enjoyed the first half of the book that centered on Kitty and Harry's courtship.  I really wish there hadn't been all the aforementioned mumbo jumbo and instead Bebris had concentrated her obvious talents on the excitement of normal life+books
This didn't make me happy+N+- Its hard to be emphathetic towards a protagonist who's depressed and decides to have an affair when she already has a great husband, two healthy children and no financial worries.  Two stars because the addition of the "history of happiness" (research for a book she is writing) was interesting.+books
Good book, but don't listen to the audio version.+N+I have listened to (and enjoyed) many books on CD in the past few years.  This reader is among the worst that I've had the displeasure of hearing.  The content of this book is great, so don't get me wrong.  However, the reader makes it impossible to experience the book the way it was intended.  He pronounces many character names incorrectly, including Carpathia and Adbullah.  His character voices range from unconvincing to downright abrasive and/or annoying (especially Carpathia's).  His voice inflection is often very wrong when reading dialogue.  He also adds pauses in the middle of sentences without any obvious reason.  These are just the most obvious and annoying problems.  There are too many to list completely here, so please trust me and avoid listening to this book+books

Ripped off!!+N+I couldn't believe that I bought this crap. I didn't learn anything from this book. It has so little content. Most of the book is an appendix listing the stocks on the Nasdaq. This is most likely an attempt to make money from the day trading craze. I bought this because of the last few glowing recommendations but  they must have been paid to write it. DON'T BUY THIS BOOK. There are better ones out there that provides better details on day trading+books
Not worth Saving+N+People have called Chuck Palahniuk's writing many things: Neo Goth, Modern Goth., New Goth....just dont get the idea that its all about whiny teenagers wearing black and griping about their latent vampire powers through bad poetry. No, Palahniuk writes a different kind of book without all of the grim color and stale mythology, but he maintains the same themes: deterioration of the human condition, lack of moral fiber in today's society, and the danker recesses of the human psyche. Survivor tackles these topics with dazzling success and even enters a few new contenders to the mix such as commercialism, consumerism, and materialism.  And this is all very old news to absolutely everybody but me, because Chuck Palahniuk has been around for a while now. It was only until recently I decided to pick up one of his paperbacks at the suggestion of my thugish Top 8 Myspace friend with too much facial hair and the clown tattoo.   Now, the way I like my stories told is with a good opening page, a large use of style, and a frugal use on the words. Typically, I don't read too many novels over 300 pages long. I have read plenty of longer books in the past, and all too often the only thing that separates a long story from a short one is that the author of a short book knows how to consolidate his word use and when to shut up. I'm happy to say Chuck Palahniuk is such a writer by all counts. Like any good stylist, his words flow like water straight from the page into your brain as the protagonist's situation is fleshed out.  Survivor opens in the first person with a single man on a plane preparing to crash into the Australian Outback.  He's the last surviving member of a death cult who has made some strange decisions...some better than others. At this time he is known the world over as a great spiritual leader, Anti Christ figure, and media mogul. There are many misconceptions about who he is and why he's on said death plane, and he'd like to set the record straight with the help of the jets black box.  And from there we meet the narrator, Tender Branson, now in the past tense and living in humble times as a religious servant. Members from his cult are killing themselves left and right, so the government gives Branson his own psychotherapist and puts him on suicide watch. But Branson is way past believing anything the church filled his mind with, and is more interested in telling other people to kill themselves after they find one of his phony suicide hotline numbers stuck to the side of a bus stop. He works for a couple that is very well off, and through his years of service has accumulated a library's worth of useful housekeeping tips. The reader is educated, in detail, how to properly remove tear stains from pillow cases, urine from drapes, bullet holes in walls, and blood from fur coats.   Everyday situations are presented from the most warped of perspectives, and depending on the readers attitude, this may either be disturbing or refreshing. Example: Is learning that everyone you love will someday die from owning and loving upwards of six hundred pet Goldfishes that have all died strike you as ironic, or sad? Are you intrigued by romances sparked in a cemetery, or turned off? How about an over analytic shrink who convinces a hypochondriac that he has multiple problems in an attempt identify and cure just one? Clever, or whatever? If you're leaning towards the former with any of these, I might have an author to recommend.  The characters are wonderful, and I took to them like a kid to a black van with candy. They have no need for convention. They have their own means of courtship, their own philosophies forged in solitude and cynicism, their own reasons for being attracted to someone else, and their own reasons for living and dying. But none of this is to say that everything is Mentos and Diet Coke. While I've never read another Palahniuk book, I have seen Fight Club, a filmed adaptation if his book, and the voice of the protagonist in that story is very similar to the voice in this one. I couldn't even read a sentence here without hearing Edward Norton's voice, so similar were the personalities. Both had a very sardonic tone towards everything modern and cynical one liners about the status quo. Sloppy, but Ill let it pass.  Did I mention that everything I just said only applies to the first half of the book? The second half falls to pieces and leaves what could have been over arching themes or meanings in smouldering shambles. It's a shame really. The first one hundred and fifty pages of Survivor read very much like something I might very well write ten years from now, whereas the second half was more like the rough draft of something I could write now. Character actions break the bank of plausibility and some scenes read like the author is trying to beat you over the head with some point that you just can't make out. For a book that started out so strong, I was left with a story that ultimately delivered nothing but the comical and poignant one liners it offered along the way. But hey, that's life, isn't it? Well sure, its life, and its shaggy dog story telling too, but read both halves and tell me that something wasnt wasted from the first one. Threads were coming together.  If the book had stayed on course all the way through, I'd be using this review to announce Chuck Palahniuk as my new favorite author, and maybe Survivor as a favorite book. Unfortunately, the second half was so lacking, I can barely recommend it as a whole. But there's no reason that good writing should go to waste. Use the first two chapters here to qualify yourself for all of Palahniuk's writings. You can do it in one sitting and be introduced to a wonderful mind and voice. From there you can hopscotch the Palahniuk library with some assurance that everything will be A-OK in your tragedy of choice.+books
Worth the read+P+Most of the reviews above are political diatribes against Keynes and his central conclusion that expanded government involvement is necessary in the economy for stabilization purposes. The key to understanding Keynes is the notion that at particular times in the business cycle, an economy can become over-productive (or under-consumptive) and thus, a vicious spiral is begun that results in massive layoffs and cuts in production as businesses attempt to equilibrate aggregate supply and demand. Thus, full employment is only one of many or multiple macro equilibria. If an economy reaches an underemployment equilibrium, something is necessary to boost or stimulate demand to produce full employment. This something COULD be business investment but because of the logic and individualist nature of investment decisions, it is unlikely to rapidly restore full employment. Keynes logically seizes upon the public budget and gov't. expenditures as the quickest way to restore full employment. Borrowing the money to finance the deficit from private households and businesses is a quick, direct way to restore full employment while at the same time, redirecting or siphoning off the funds from the private sector which caused the over-production in the first place. Although difficult to read, this book is essential to our understanding of modern economics. Far from being destructive, it alone has been responsible for nearly 60 years of growth without a major depression as we experienced worldwide in the 1930's. I recommend you read this book+books
I loved this as a kid+P+Someone wrote that this book is too depressing. I beg to differ.   I'm not a professional child psychologist, but looking back on my own experience, and how much I loved this book as a child, I think  children have very powerful feelings all the time, including longing and sadness. It's comforting to see those feelings described and reflected outside yourself. If adults act like the whole world is happy-happy all the time, it can feel very lonely and isolating when you have other feelings. I would venture to guess that empathizing with characters in stories helps children develop a sense of connection between their own feelings and other people's feelings. This connection makes us feel less lonely and also allows us to be genuinely caring toward others.    I can still see, in my mind's eye, the picture of Sylvester the Rock under a blanket of snow, and feel the almost unbearable empathy that I felt for him when I read this book as a child. But it was a good feeling to feel such profound emotions. It was not unpleasant--it was very real, alive, and human--it made me feel connected with the world. And it was a safe place to feel these emotions, because I knew how the story ended, I knew everything would be okay.   I loved this book very much. I wonder if I still have it... +books
The Mystery of the Zombie Hunch+P+As the concept of the modular structure of the brain emerged, objections to the idea took the form of "Well, if my brain's made up of computers, somebody in there has to be in charge.  It had better be me!"   This comment, paraphrased from philosopher Jerry Fodor, typifies what Daniel Dennett has been contending with for many years.  Although the "Cartesian theatre" notion, that the body was one aspect of our being and the mind another - "dualism" -  has supposedly been supplanted, it has not lost its hold on our view of consciousness.  We continue to insist, in some form or other, that "somebody, and it better be me" is inside our minds looking out at the world.  Although we can't find that "self" in there, we have a hunch it's there.  When Dennett wrote "Consciousness Explained" in 1991, it seemed the "homunculus" representing our "self" had been laid to rest.  This excellent collection of essays and lectures, is an update on that earlier work.  As lectures, they have a conversational tone, yet impart many deep insights.  Addressing consciousness through four major themes, Dennett shows us the project of eradicating "dualism" remains incomplete.  Until that view of "self" is discarded, our understanding of consciousness will remain misleading.  The first theme he addresses is the "zombie".  Philosophers have posed the idea that a duplicate person, identical to you in every way but one, is logically possible.  The person would act as you act, talk as you do, have the same preferences and distastes.  But it would not be conscious.  This proposal presumes that something in you could be identified that is lacking in the zombie.  For most of us, who still feel our "self" remains somehow separate within us, the logic seems reasonable.  Dennett carefully examines the implications of the proposal, and dismisses it as modernised dualism.  If a region of the brain holds the key to "self" it remains out of sight and undetectable.  Perhaps the most challenging segment of the book deals with "heterophenomonology".  This tongue-twisting phrase refers to the methods used in cognitive science.  Because consciousness is "often celebrated as a mystery beyond science" Dennett challenges researchers to take a step back from commonly accepted techniques.  Become a "Martian" cognitive scientist to broaden the scope of the work.  One facet of this approach relies on understanding what "folk psychology" is, then building from there.  We prefer to believe that what we believe is entirely private and unaccessible.  Heterophenomonolgy, he contends, will expose aspects of our consciousness we view as a "mystery".    One of those "mysteries" has been wrapped in the idea of "qualia".  Probably one of the poorest concepts in philosophy, "qualia" are things said to possess "intrinsic qualities".  When you carefully examine those "intrinsic" properties, they begin to fade and vanish.  If "qualia" is in an object we see, such as colour, how can it change without our noticing?  Tests of "change blindness" indicate we can miss much concerning "qualia".  Even the philosophic community, Dennett notes, cannot agree on a definition of "qualia".  Yet, like the homunculus in the mind viewing the world, it steadfastly remains in use.  The author examines this idea further in relating the story of "Mary", the colour-deprived scientist.  In "Consciousness Explained", Dennett proposed the Multiple Drafts Model of consciousness and cognition.  In this collection, he enhances the original concept.  With no centre in the brain, consciousness necessarily must be a distributed process.  The progress of imaging and other technologies have expanded our view of the brain's functions.  Dennett argues that the brain is "fame" not "television".  The process is one of competition for dominance, no matter how fleeting.  The mind is not a "top-down" or "bottom-up" process, but a "sideways" one.  Ideas, experiences and other informational bits jostle for "clout".  It's not easy to shed the idea of a special "self" in your mind, but all that's going on in there is still you.   As usual, Dennett has challenged successfully the "established" views of consciousness.  Clearly, he argues, consciousness is neither an arcane "mystery" nor beyond serious and definitive investigation.  The mind-set erecting barricades using the bricks of "qualia" and the mortar of the "Cartesian theatre" can, and must be, overcome for serious investigation to proceed.  Delicacy and care must be employed, but the prize is understanding.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada+books
Most obstinate denial of the most obvious+N+The author fancies himself a Copernicus, by, similarly to the reversal of the notion that the sun revolves around the earth, rendering the notion of consciousness an "illusion" (last word, p.178). His ego is indeed enormous, my knowing of no other author quoting (p.45) and incessantly citing his own writing.  The notion of the sun revolving is an inference, from observing its change of position relative to the earth, and motion indeed is considered relative. But consciousness is not an inference. It is the most immediate phenomenon by which everything we know, or imagine, is manifested. Dennett persistently investigates distinctions in our brains, from dispositions to memories, often couching them in esoteric or otherwise unfamiliar terms, while sidestepping the simple fact that whatever the detailed particulars, all is presented to us through the medium of consciousness.  He puts great emphasis on the third-person approach, like questioning a subject about his perceptions, so as to discover misunderstandings about the inner workings of the mind, forgetting that all of these, whether actual perceptions or beliefs or else, are ingredients of consciousness. This his "scientific method", compared to first-person introspection, is the only approved one.  It is shared by others. Like Patricia Churchland, he has contempt for "folk" psychology, pitting it against favored "academic" (p.35). They also share a derogatory attitude toward dissenters, regarding them as reactionaries (p.8) or naysayers. The views are admittedly materialist, holding Cartesian dualism of mind and body "bankrupt" or a "disaster", as does John Searle.  Why? Descartes is not in line with their assumed all-inclusive scientific method, embraced also by philosophers, who traditionally delved deeper into issues of knowledge. I do so newly in my book and here wish to note that however physical inquiry progresses, consciousness, via which the inquiry is made, remains a distinct phenomenon.+books
Automotive History+P+A great book! The author is big on automotive history, so you will know more about the industry and the people that formed it. Walter Chrysler just seems to be the man he tells the story around. I have found interest in other people from this time frame to read about too from this book+books
Ann Rule's finest erotic work.+N+Ann Rule wrote the story of a young couple on a camping trip from Hell! The hero is murdered and the murderer is sexually obsessed with his sexy young wife, Joanne Lindstrom. He captures her, strips and rapes her several times over, and the poor victim is helpless in the woods and grows dependent on the evil &quot;Red Man&quot; She even falls in love with him, and he succeeds in planting his seed in her belly. This sounds like some wild male rape fantasy, but Ms. Rule wrote it, not I. Strange crime story, with highly explicit rape scenes. Highly recommended+books
Brings Us Back To The Basics+P+I'll always be a country girl at heart, and this book appeals to that heart. I got Philip Gulley's book and &quot;People of Passion&quot; by Carl Mays at the same time, and immensely enjoyed them both (even though they are quite different). Front Porch Tales is about the author's life and the people with whom he has come in contact in his small town. Through short, interesting, and witty stories, he reveals much about human nature and what makes people tick.     Through his tales, Gulley emphasizes grabbing hold of life and really living it rather than just plodding through. It's a simple book, but certainly one that should not be overlooked, because of the value it offers. This easy, flowing, and fun read left me uplifited and I recommend it to other readers who want to get more out of the life that God has given them.+books
Definitely One Star!!!+N+I was extremely disappointed with this book. It was not what I expected and I was bored 95% of the time+books
'Nothing new except language, the ever found...'+P+My favorite piece in this book is 'Answers to a Questionnaire'--  vintage Sontag-- thinking, witnessing, and finally enlightening everything she must.  Despite the self-loathing revealed by a number of American reviewers below who show themselves apparently ready to detest integrity itself, the naked truth comes clear and comes clear!  Clear thinking may yet be the last frontier!  A worthy argument for such is surely made in the pages of this book.  It is even for those who are spiteful without cause to discover themselves lurking in the heart of this book, grevious as ignorance is, & wretched as spite becomes in the end.  Listen-- vitriolic political sideswiping is as American as dumplings.  Sontag, characteristically and sympathetically, not only notes its irrevelance, but conjures an antidote called moral patience, so no wonder all the shouts and curses against her!  Making certain their own avenues of self-discovery venture nothing wiser than a hepped up, but sunless, hyper-nationalism wretchedly disguised as patriotism, it's unfortunately not surprising the chorus of disappoval this woman engenders.  Thank goodness Sontag remains preoccupied with her Art!--  a living, teaching, redemptive art burnished, by now, to an holistic glow, as every page of this book bears witness.  What in the world are you talking about??! -- SUSAN SONTAG IS AMERICAN TO THE CORE!  I reckon that aspect of her identity contributes as much as any other of her native gifts to the beauty and usefulness of her art.  Wake up, people+books
Paranoid and unhelpful+N+Should you be afraid of your microwave oven? This book discusses that non-issue for several paragraphs, before concluding that no, you probably shouldn't be afraid of your microwave. That embodies what's wrong with this book. It pretends to be reassuring while actually planting a bunch of paranoid ideas. It also assumes that you, the reader, are the mother-to-be, while having very little to say to your partner, in a way that I find subtly sexist. Overall, it has plenty to make you extra-worried. For instance, it advises posting pictures of healthy babies all around your house (on the door, in the kitchen, on the bathroom mirror, really, all around your house), in order to continually remind yourself to eat a very rigid diet -- as if the bump in your belly wasn't already making you worry quite enough. If you think that it would be helpful to post a nagging sign on your front-door to ask you daily, "Have you fed your baby breakfast today?" then you may like this book.   Personally, I found that _What to Expext_ left me alarmed about microwaves & air pollution & ambient noise & even exercise in ways that were not helpful. For a book so full of information, it also, curiously, failed to address any of my specific questions. How soon should I begin taking folic acid or other prenatal vitamins: as soon as I start trying to get pregnant, or only after the pregnancy-test comes back positive? Is there anything I can do to increase my odds of getting pregnant? What are those odds, anyway, for a woman my age? These seemed like reasonable questions to me, but to find answers, I had to look in the far-more-helpful book by Ann Douglas, _The Mother of All Pregnancy Books_ -- which also features a nifty week-by-week what's-happening-inside-your-body chart that I love. The other book I highly recommend is Armin Brott's _The Expectant Father_, which has terrific & reasonable advice you won't find elsewhere. By those two, not this one.+books
A Superficially Selective Journalistic Survey of the Church+N+Written by the same author as Cults, New Religions Movements, and Your Family, as well as Defending the Faith: A Beginner's Guide to Cults and New Religions, gives a sense where the author is headed with this prodigious "history" of the Church.  Although not an actual history of Mormonism, but more of a superficially selective journalistic survey of the Church, (its people, dealings and influences) the book offers the reader an enormous panoramic overview at the entire 170 year span of its existence.  Yes, the volume is anti-Mormon, it is negative and has no balanced view or viewpoint.  Abanes uses enflamed and sensualistic language from the start and propagates the same misjudgments as previous anti-Mormon writers (confusing the action of members with the doctrines of the institution, using enflamed and unreliable anti-Mormon sources as well as regurgitating old anti-Mormon arguments that have been dealt-with in scholarly journals and balanced histories) yes, he mostly uses only secondary materials and relies on the Tanner's as an authoritative source, and yes, the author has no clue what historical perspective is, but, one must give the author his due for the broad scope of the work.  He not only covers all the standard anti-Mormon fare (the Danites, blood atonement, polygamy, money digging, etc.); but current subjects as well (including the Osmond's, Steve Benson, the 2002 Olympics, Paul Dunn, Thomas Ferguson, and racism). I enjoyed the author's journalistic and creative approach to chapter and sub-chapter headings as well (i.e., "Bloody Brigham," "Big Trouble in Little Missouri," "Pride and Prejudice" and "Thinking is a Sin").  I like that Abanes uses the internet and listed URL's for reference and resource, I liked his use of charts (First Vision, Book of Mormon, failed prophecies), and even though this book would not be published by an academic press or a large well-known publisher, it was published by a distinguished independent publisher that was since bought by the Avalon Publishing Group.  Although the work cannot be recommend as a studious publication or an important work on Mormonism, the author does show that the Church as an institution does have a long way to go in answering questions about its past, its "official" vs. its "actual" history, and currently about its political activities, treatment of its "academic" members (versus the coddling it shows towards its more notable members (including general authorities) as well as its suppression of its own history that includes the closing-off of its records and library.  The volume has 436 pages of text, five appendices (one containing a helpful glossary of "Mormon terms"), 152 pages of notes, a small bibliography and a 22 page index+books
Makes Me Want to Go Build a New House+P+I review a lot of architecture books, and this one more than most makes me want to go out and build a new house. The subject of the book is small houses. It consists of pictures and the story of some fifty houses, all of which are less than 1,300 square feet. Many of them are much less than 1,300 feet, indeed down into the 300-400 square foot size.   I live in a small house -- 900 square feet or so -- that's about a hundred years old. But compared to the layout, the beauty the simplicity of design, mine's a dump. I'm getting the urge to go visit a realtor friend. One thing about these houses is that many of them are on what would be considered hard to build on lots. And such lots tend to be cheap. There's a new architect in town that's fresh out of school and may have more originality than the older guys. Maybe if I give her this book, with a few houses marked. Hmmmmm!   One thing I didn't like, most of the bed rooms are on the second floor. I was in a house once that had a fire. The amount of smoke generated in just a minute or two was incredible. I don't want a bed room upstairs, if necessary I want to be able to close the door to keep the smoke out and get out through a wondow or emergency door.   Other than that, this is a great idea book. The pictures are beautiful. There's not as much detail as I would like, but adding detail would have to mean either fewer houses or bigger book, so I guess it's a nice balance+books
Wife: "Best book I've read in, like, years!"+P+I bought "One Hundred Demons" as kind of a shot-in-the-dark gift for my wife. She ended up reading it all in one sitting and gave me her opinion. "This book is, like, one of the best books I've read in years! You have to read it! She even, like, gives you instructions in the back on how to paint your own demons!" Buying a good gift without being given specific instructions is something I do once every 10 years maybe. I did it TWICE this year (I also did good by buying her some thermal "dog" pajamas from Target on a whim). I ended up reading it myself -- and I thought it was an awesome book. I couldn't (and still can't) put it down either! There are a lot of nuances that are very funny. Lynda Barry does a great job conveying personality and humanism. Very colorful and fun to read. Will likely buy more of her books -- I (we) need more than just one fix+books

Very fanciful, not data-driven+N+This vision of the future reminded me of common errors on physics tests where the student leaves out a variable or two and makes a wildly incorrect prediction of an object's future behavior.  People have many connections to a place, which do not depend merely on their own security or on currency fluctuations.  These emotional and cultural connections will keep people from being entirely atomized and "at-will" citizens for a long time to come.  In reading the book, by the way, the style will annoy some rewaders in that it is not written in the modern, American style where predictions would be tied back to and grounded in data and trends.  It's much more in an old fashioned English amateur gentleman scholar style where nothing is substantiated by anything and it's all sort of breezy.  Some may like that. +books
A Gimmick by any other name...+N+This is a fascinating concept, and a marketable one as well, in light of America's current infatuation with the Edifice Complex.  Considering the author's scholarly credentials, SEX AND REAL ESTATE should have been a absorbing book.  &quot;Should have&quot; is the pivotal phrase here.  No question that Garber's body of knowledge is vast--she hops all over the map with only the most tenuous connection to her thesis.  Maybe she merely was showing off how much smarter she is than the average reader.  While I have no doubt but that this fact is true, the book still quickly descends into boring psychobabble.  Anyone seeking enlightenment is bound to be disappointed+books
A Masterpiece!!!+P+It broke my heart to see anyone compare this masterpiece to a Disney film or a modern work of art.  There is NO comparison.  I first read this book 17 years ago and was so captivated that I could not put it down. I often wonder why Hollywood tried to reproduce this book at all, since not one single movie has ever come close to giving us a glimpse of all this book has to offer.  The ties and the love and the betrayal, the architectual detail alone, all of it make for one of the most profound works of literature ever written.  Please do not be spoiled by the quick reads that one is most aquainted with today.  Take the time to reaquaint yourself with this extraordinary work that will leave you heartbroken and amazed by the end.  +books

Beautifully done!+P+Elizabeth Strout comes back better than ever with this wonderfully written story. A family subsumed by grief, confined by societal norms, is able to, in their own way, overcome obstacles and begin to find the true meaning of love. Unfortunately, the ending didn't quite live up to the rest of the book, but still well worth a read+books
The Scarlet Letter - should have been a short story+N+I am going against the grain here but can anyone explain how this story can take so long to tell.  Trying to enjoy the majority of American authors, Hawthornes works have not be an easy go.  Though admittedly not a fan of Hawthornes full length works, his short stores can be enjoyable.  But a book that begins with 28 pages of 'The Custom House', before the story even begins, is already very dull.  I, like many other people, was forced to read this work for a sophomore literature class.  That was 31 years ago and I still remember thinking what a moderately entertaining short story this would have made.  In its form, its unbearable. +books
your head will split open and ooze goop after reading this+N+All I can say is pass me some aspirin. This is a dozy of a bad novel. As it says on the dust jacket, a Supreme Court law clerk grabs a petition and ends up becoming deceased. Its up to the brother to uncover the truth by finding the real killer who had let a poor black man rot away for a crime he did not commit. At the same time the brother contends with mysterious bad guys out to get him and stop the unearthing of the evidence. Not only does he deal with his family, but his brothers friend, a sexy young law clerk herself and the duplicity on the bench she works for.  And that's only the start of the plot.   Its really pretty bad, it descends into mired pretensions and goofy resolutions. The characters are so shallow that you are left with little notion of who they are except for a faint nasty after taste over their conceded ways. Baldacci is along with James Patterson and Dean Koontz one of America's worst authors. If you want an author who writes on a similar vein to this, try one of Harlan Coben's last four or so stand alone thrillers with out the character Myron Bolitar in it. Or for a more sophisticated read, look for Denis Lehane, he wrote the amazing Mystic River, but his PI series located in Boston is pretty good as well.+books
A book to reread frequently+P+One of the most wonderful things about Rabbi Kushner's writings is that he isn't afraid to tackle the hard questions.  If we indeed have a Shepherd, why isn't He doing a better job?  To this question, Kushner says, "the psalmist would teach us to see the world, without illusions that nothing bad will ever happen, but without the fear that we will be utterly destroy This is a lovely book full of hope and wisdom.  Drawing on the individual lines of the Twenty-Third Psalm, Rabbi Kushner (known best for his book Why Bad Things Happen to Good People) creates 15 essays that are thought-provoking and inspiring. He outlines the historical background of the words of the psalm, noting "The earliest ancestors of the Hebrew People who gave us the Bible were nomads, owning no property, bound to no one location but traveling with their flocks and herds wherever there was pastureland for the animals to graze on." The analogy of God to a shepherd makes perfect sense in that environment. The beauty of the analogy is that it still speaks to us today. The image which is evoked is one of caring and greater knowledge. ed by the things that do happen."  Kushner is skilled at relating Biblical literature to questions and concerns of today.  He relates the verse to terrorists, Einstein and daily living. He provides insights and advice as to how we can live our lives more effectively.  His words also provide hope to all of us:  "You may have to work hard to earn your living...But you don't have to work hard in order to feel good about yourself.  All you have to do is stop striving, relax, and say to yourself, I feel good about who I am."  This slim volume will stay in a handy place in my home for years to come.  It's a book I will come back to again and again for wisdom, courage and peace+books

Seeing things in a whole new light.+P+This book has cast the alleged Biblical condemnation of homosexuality in a whole new light.  For those who always felt that there was something very wrong and un-Godly about the fundamentalist's extreme anti-gay views, this book will certainly confirm what you have known and felt in your heart all along.     For those Christians with gay family and friends, who have understood first hand the conflicts between what they know, experience, and God has impressed within their hearts, and the fundamentalist (and even mainstream) condemnation of the lives of your loved ones, this will open your eyes to the reality and truth of what is written in the Bible.   All in all a great read and an eye opener.  +books
Not what I had hoped it would be...+N+I really was looking forward to something that explored the emotional whirlwind that I have been going through.  This was certainly not it.  It touches on what I wanted and then veers off into mythologically-based new age nonsense (and I have nothing against new age stuff in general).  If you are looking for a treatment of what weddings and marriage mean in the modern world, I recommend Kamy Wicoff's I Do But I Don't.  I also hear that A Walk Down the Aisle is good.

Review of Walt Whitman's  "Leaves of Grass"+P+This thick soft-backed "pocket" book has 490 pages.  It could be called The Complete Whitman.  It contains hundreds of poems.       I am a senior citizen who had not read any Whitman for more than 50 years and am enjoying it very much. His descriptions of the 19th century's people, places, and inventions are eye-openers.  He was actually a feminist before there was such a concept, and also an abolitionist.  He truly believed in equality and democracy.  He was a nature lover and wanted to protect the environment.       Of course, there are parts I could quibble about, but that would be foolish.  Whitman was a man ahead of his time.  +books
Responsible Freedom and Democracy, Handmaids of Human Happiness+P+Fareed Zakaria rightly forces his readers to think harder than they usually do about the interdependence existing between freedom and democracy.  In the West, constitutional liberalism, with its checks and balances, gave birth to modern democracy.  However, too much democracy can paradoxically lead to less freedom. Think for instance about humiliated Germany after WWI under the Weimar Republic and its subsequent mistreatment of different minorities for specious reasons under the Nazis.  Similarly, more choices can result into less accountability.  Think for instance about those who fail to plan financially for old age independent of a social security system increasingly at risk of insolvency due to shifting demographics.  In the U.S. and overseas, right without responsibility is usually as immoral and unjust as responsibility without right.  Unelected bodies such as the U.S. Supreme Court, the U.S. Federal Reserve, or the World Trade Organization are a necessary evil.  Expertise of their respective members is judged more important than their democratic legitimacy to hopefully pursue the better good of either a human community or a society of sovereign states.  These unelected officials are not held accountable to the tyranny of instant gratification that too many elected officials perceive, rightly or wrongly, among a majority of their constituents.  Because unelected bodies are a necessary evil to account for human weaknesses, they should remain the exception rather than the rule.  Pleading for an increase in unelected bodies, though well-intentioned, could paradoxically lead to a weakening support of the best-in-class in their respective categories.   +books

"She thinks last of her child."+P+Nora Roberts, writing as J.D. Robb, has created a successful series based on a few basic principles. The first, and in my opinion, most important aspect is a fascinating heroine, who presents different layers that the author has been revealing in each installment and will certainly continue to do so. Lieutenant Eve Dallas is a tough cop, who is relentless in her pursue of justice and feels as if the victims were hers to save. On the other hand, she is the wife of the billionaire Roarke, and has to deal with parties and charity events in which she is expected to mingle and maintain polite chit-chat with the guests. She has been adjusting slowly to this area of her life and even though she does not like it, she has learned to accept it. The fact that Eve was abused by her father when she was a child and had to kill him in order to escape also plays an important role in the development of the story and in almost every case Eve faces. Her husband also has a complex past, involving an abusing father who killed Roarke's mother and then lied to him about who his real mother was. Only recently did the billionaire learned the truth about this and reunited with what was left of his family.   Besides the two main characters, Robb has created a supporting cast that adds appeal to the series and which I consider to be the second factor in its success. Peabody is Eve's former aide and current partner who has recently made detective and who usually adds a good part of humor to the narration with her witty comments. She is in love with McNabb, a policeman working in the Electronic Detectives Division, and they are in the process of moving together to a new apartment. There are other interesting characters: Feeney, Eve's trainer and mentor, Mavis, Eve's best friend, Nadine Furst, a reporter for Channel 75 who has become a close friend with Eve, Charles, a licensed companion who is now dating a doctor, and several others. One of the most appealing aspects of the series has to do with the development of the stories of each of these people, and that is why I recommend reading the series in order.   The third and final element that helps create a superb series is the cleverly crafted world in which the action takes place: New York in the year 2059. The setting presents several characteristics that make it very different from our world, like cars that fly, drones that take care of household chores, the ban on firearms, the anticancer vaccine, the legalization of prostitution, the difficulty for getting real coffee, etc. Also, the advances in terms of technology require criminals to be more clever and careful when committing their crimes, and we usually end up reading about complex mysteries. In this novel, Eve is summoned to the scene of a ghastly murder. The victim was raped and strangled using a red ribbon and before leaving, the killer took out her eyes as a memento. The poor woman had a four-year-old kid and worked as hired help for a wealthy couple, and there is nothing that indicates that someone would have wanted to hurt her.  Everything is business as normal until Celina Sanchez shows up wanting to talk to Eve and claiming she has information about the murder. Celina is a psychic and claims that she saw the killing in a vision. Even though Eve does not really believe in this stuff, she goes along with it following Peabody's advice and realizing that if it does not help at least it will not hurt either. This is not the first time Robb uses supernatural events in the series, but in her previous attempt she went too far making it hardly believable. In the present try the results were much better, and since the case Eve is facing is one of the best mysteries in the series so far, the overall quality of the novel benefits even more.  As usual, Robb creates a good balance between the police procedural and the development of the personal stories of the characters in the series. Of course, the romantic scenes are still present through the narration, but without overdoing it. I was very pleased with this installment, and I am looking forward to the next one. A final word of advice, the publisher's blurb gives out important information regarding events towards the end of the novel. I would have preferred to read the book without knowing these facts. The good thing is that even if you read them, there will be a surprise waiting for you+books
Implausible thriller with a twist that just doesn't  work+N+Having a novel's narrator turn out to be the killer is a fairly common staple in the mystery and suspense genre.  When this plot device is done well, the reader is pleasantly shocked by the twist, not left wondering what the hell happened.  When the twist works best, the author hasn't actually lied to the reader, but carefully choosen his or her words to create false assumptions.  When the twist comes, the reader experiences a `light bulb moment', realizing they were duped, but that they should have seen it coming.    In Beach Road the ending doesn't make much sense, and the reader ends up feeling betrayed when the twist is revealed.   Beach Road features multiple first person narratives and includes a preface that warns the reader that some narrators may be lying.  My question to Mr. Patterson is:  If one of the characters lies to the reader for the first ï¿½ of the novel, why do they start telling the truth near the end?  Why not lie all the way through(or tell the truth right from the beginning)?  I think it would have been much more interesting if the character's lies were exposed, not by their own confession, but through the observations of other characters.  Of course the unlikely twist is only one of the problems with this novel.   My other major gripe is that so much of it doesn't make sense.  For example, the elusive and ruthless drug dealer known only as Loco turns out to be a character that everyone in town knows.  Somehow Loco and the killer maintain a drug dealing operation in a small community without anyone knowing.  This is ridiculous.  Drug dealers need to be known and they need to be easy to find.  How else do people buy drugs from them?  It's ridiculous to think that they could become major drug dealers in this small community without anyone knowing, even with silly nicknames.    Second case in point: the killer dispatches a number of people with ruthless efficiency by putting bullets through their brains, yet inexplicably tries to kill the only person who knows their secret by shooting them at close range in the abdomen. They don't notice the absence of blood, and don't check to make sure the shot was fatal.  It doesn't make sense.  Patterson churns out novels faster than Nora Roberts these days and apparently isn't worried about quality.  Beach Road is fast paced but the gaps in logic and far fetched ending make this a Patterson novel to avoid.+books
The Longest Winter+P+Outstanding book.  I was lucky enough to meet Lyle Bouck.  I can honestly say, he is one of the finest men I have ever had a chance to meet.  There is no reason this man should not have won the Medal of Honor.  A great read, and excellent job on telling the story of these heros+books
Surveying human needs, design challenges, and social issues alike.+P+DROSSCAPE: WASTING LAND IN URBAN AMERICA is a top pick not just for architects and building designers, but for any homeowners or buyer who would understand waste landscapes and how they are handled. Landscape architects must learn to accommodate them - and homeowners need to learn about them. DROSSCAPE is for both, offering a radical new method of thinking about landscape and its problems. Ten cities are analyzed through aerial photography, maps and charts with an eye to surveying human needs, design challenges, and social issues alike.  Diane C. Donovan California Bookwatc+books
Total Garbage!+N+This book is pretty near worthless. I started reading it knowing that I was unlikely to agree with much of Vicki's "advice," but I thought it still might be funny. It wasn't. Also, lots of her advice is not only wrong it is *completely* wrong--as in, not only not backed up by evidence, but actually *contraindicated* by evidence. I could not even finish reading the book after I got to the complete drivel that was her "advice" on infant feeding--she presented the section as "common considerations when deciding to breastfeed" and then proceeded to describe the absolute worst-case-scenario for everything possibly related to breastfeeding (& several things that can't be blamed on breastfeeding at all!). It was a common considerations section, but would have been more aptly named, "reasons I think breastfeeding is awful and no one should do it" section.   I think it is valuable for women to read books that present a less-than-rosy view of motherhood, because too often we have a strong and persistent "perfect mother" image in our heads that is very difficult to live up to (especially if we have perfectionistic tendencies). I adore real-life, tell-it-like it is motherhood memoirs--they are validating and supportive. This book, however, is overwhelming negative and baby-bashing. There are much, much better books out there that do not worship motherhood, but do not completely despise it either+books
old-fashioned elitist boredom+N+This is a fairly helpful book for those born before the '70s-- a time when "a yarn" wasn't an archaic term. Does it give some helpful hints?  Sure, there's the obvious ones like show don't tell and all characters have free will. But fiction has changed a lot since Henry James (thankfully), and this book might be better left unread. Plus, I don't buy the "only people who aren't well-read don't like it" argument. I've read nearly all the books mentioned and I still wish I never bought this book+books
True Betrayal+P+This was one of those tapes that you really do not want to wait to hear the rest of it.    The ending is a surprise even for those of us who consider ourself mystery book master solvers.+books
From the Same Minds That Brought You Joel Osteen+N+I purchased Eldredge's "Wild at Heart", and I didn't think it was scripturally sound. I was given "Waking the Dead" as a present, so I tried to read it as well. I finally gave it up.   John Eldredge's writing is typical of today's movement to bring the world into the church. Trying to show a young Christian the religious aspects of movies like "The Matrix" may work, but to my 48 year old ears it rings very hollow. Perhaps it boils down to how much you will dilute Christ's message to get people to listen. For better or worse, I have little patience for it.   The author also presents the image of God as "my friend". To me this is nothing but another watering down of the Gospel message to get the world to accept it. Giving the Creator human attributes brings Him down to a level where we can work things out between us. I can't find that kind of relationship in any legitimate Bible translation. After all, my friend wouldn't let my saintly mother die, and save a worthless drug addict now would he? God my friend probably wouldn't have sent His Son to die for my worthless self anyway.   This is exactly the same theology as building the largest "Christian" church in the United States, and not putting any crosses in it so as not to "offend anyone". It's the same as getting on a nationally televised program, and stuttering about whether you believe those who don't accept Christ are doomed to hell. When you profess to be a Christian minister or author and you can't speak correctly of what Christianity teaches, it's time to examine just what you really believe. God's word is not always easy to swallow. Either it's the truth or it isn't.   Mr. Eldredge also speaks often of "setting hearts free". While I do believe hearts are free when released from sin, a Christian is bought and paid for with Christ's blood and not "free" at all. Titus 1 (KJ) begins, "Paul, a servant of God,and an apostle of Jesus Christ"...Christians ARE freed, but to begin a life of service.   For a more accurate and fulfilling study, I recommend "The Way of the Master" books and videos by Ray Comfort/Kirk Cameron. +books
It is a lovely notebook however it was not for me+P+all I really wanted was some place where I could keep track of the books I read and my thoughts on them. This book is wondefully laid out but it is oriented more for people who belong to reding groups or book clubs etc. If you just want a little book diary for yourself then do not buy this book. Do yourself a favor and buy a regular notebook but if you do belong to a group or like to discuss your books then this is an excellent buy+books
Simple, Easy, Refreshing+P+This book fits in a pocket and is easy to use. The format works - short inspirational quotes from east and west on a given theme on the left hand page, Ms. Santucci's brief, insightful commentary on the right.   Effective, uplifting book with attractive graphics and illustrations.  Highly recommended+books
A must-read. Period.+P+I recently read Berlinski's book as well as Bawer's "While Europe Slept"  and "Anti-Americanism" by Jean Francois Revel. These are very important books in that they shed light on the mythology of the American Left, according to which Europe (Western Europe, that is) is the Promised Land. Since they detest America, they need to find some model to emulate. Well, on closer inspection Europe is not it. Today's Europe had been left hopelessly behind. It lives off the corpses of the past, and having been given a sense of security (by the American foreign policy and its military might) and illusion of prosperity (originally spawned by US economic aid and today dependent on US spending power!), they feel superior to the US. Anyone who ever debated angry Europeans will quickly discover that the superiority is really a reaction to their profound inferiority complexes.  Disregard the one-star reviews. An M. McDonald below claims that the book is "short on facts"... This from a guy who claims that Germany is the world's largest exporter... Forgot to mention though that it's the larger exporter of MERCHANDISE. If you add services, the US exports are at $1.15 trillion vs. Germany's $893B. And, thanks to diversification, the US is less vulnerable to global economic slowdowns. McDonald's is wrong. He's wrong about public education too: Europe's schools are "vastly superior"?...Does he have any idea what goes on in the schools of Paris, London and Rome?? he says China not seen as a threat to EU? Anyone who's been to Italy recently, with interests going deeper than gelato, surely must have seen numerous campaigns against Chinese textile imports. My bet? In 5-6 yrs we will be buying superior quality suits made in China for $500 vs. Zegna's $1800 outfits. Indeed, nothing to worry about. Etecetera, etcetera.  Read this and the other books I mentioned so you can be immune to and be able to eloquently respond to this type of leftist pap+books
The Code of Kings+P+This is a fairly in depth discussion of the epigraphic evidence from various Mayan cities, including Tikal, Palenque, Copan, Seibal, Chichen Itza, Uxmal, and Iximche.  The first chapter gives a brief overview of the  Mayan region, writing, architecture, and mythology that helps orient the  reader to the cultural and physical setting of the ancient centers.   Thereafter each chapter is deducated to a specific site, its architecture,  the written material illuminating its history, and its public  personalities.  Ms Schele's book brings to life the ancient people, making  them more real to the reader.  It, like &quot;Lords of Tikal&quot; by Peter  Harrison (for which see my review list by clicking on my name or go to the  book itself), helps the reader appreaciate the accomplishments of this  society and of the researchers who have reclaimed it+books
Lifts the Veil to See Inside England's Upper Class Lives+P+I thought this book would be Brit Chick-Lit with some aristocracy thrown in, but was in for a surprise.  It's an analysis of the British upper class and the aspirations of the middle class through the story of Edity Lavery who catches herself an Earl.   The adjustments she must make trying to fit in makes an interesting story.  Actually each scene gets analyzed from different angles, but for an American reader the rehashing of tone of voice and raised eyebrow is probably necessary.   Much of the story would have passed me by without the explanations that accompany it through the voice of a well-born actor, the earl's mother, Edith herself, and a host of other characters. Things get messy when Edith finds life in a stately home a crashing bore.  Intrigued by a handsome actor, she contemplates chucking the prestigious marriage that she worked so hard to achieve.+books
Felt like a Marvel story, but then again...+N+There is no perfect Earth.  The DC universe is corrupt?  Let's see...Joker actually turns out to be a hero (I know, he's not presented as one, but he offs AL, so he's a hero).  Wonder Woman kills someone?  Yeah, right.  Batman actually points a gun at someone?  Yeah, right again.  The big blue schoolboy saves the universe? Hack, ptooey.  Everybody makes mistakes (the big idea from the series along with there's no perfect Earth).  It's too bad that DC didn't realize that this series was one of them+books
NOT THE BEST MOUSE BOOK+N+A MOUSE LOOSES HIS FAMILY MEMBERS & THEN FINDS THEM.  IT'S JUST AN OK BOOK, VERY UNDERSERVING OF ALL THE 5-STAR REVIEWS.  A BETTER MOUSE BOOK WOULD BE- IF YOU GIVE A MOUSE A COOKIE.+books
Sleeping With Fear!!+P+I have to say I agree with most of the other reviews.. Kay Hooper is one of a verrrry few authors I buy in hardback.. I was dissapionted in the book.. Where were the agents with their psychic abilities.. It was hard to follow where Riley was going. The ending seems a bit thrown together.. I mean her and Ash were talking one min and the next she was off in a Hummer..I like what she tried to do with the book but I think she fell short.. It seems to me Kay Hooper was not able to write the amnesia well into the story at all.. I sure hope the next book is better I think I will wait for it in paperback+books
One Word: Scary!+P+Scares me more than any terrorist, earthquake, comet or meteor from space ever could!  As a med student and son and nephew of military doctors this book frightens me much more than my uncle's stories of Viet Nam casualties, or my father's dealings with injury victims in a big city hospital.  The Coming Plague deals with our inability to truly comprehend a global disater out there just waiting to strike. With recent occurences such as Marburg's grip in Africa as well as SARS, AIDS continued spread, and Bird Flu in Asia, ordinary citizens and especially governments around the world had better wake up ...  Seems that isn't happening. Even the CDC and WHO according to some of the early pioneers in the fight against infectious disease, are today filled with pencil pushers, bureaucrats and  people that have no field experience. They have lost touch with the real world of microbes. Compare them to generals that have never been in any real combat abroad, but are commanding troops.  This sobering book reveals that with all of our scientific knowledge and skill, we are not ready for a pandemic in the 21st century. That no we cannot totally fend off every serious microbe that comes our way, but that we'd better be prepared!  Suspenseful, heroic, mysterious, unsettling and painfully sad at times, this book is very difficult to put down. The Bible of infectious diease. Full of astounding information. It is a must read for anyone curious about this monumentally important subject.   +books
The Best Book I Read in 2005 +P+And the Band Played On is an act of phenomenal research and writing, and a very frightening book on many levels because of the political wrangling, political bumbling, and political disregard for a medical crisis which cost the lives of so many, the scientific in-fighting which slowed medical break throughs and sacrificed lives, and the insanity of national agencies which were supposed to be saving lives, but which in this case knowingly risked the lives of many either because they didn't want to do the work, didn't want to spend the money, or didn't want to anger certain political groups.  Gay men were deemed to be utterly dispensable by so many.    It's the sign of a good book when it brings out strong emotions.  This book provoked in me anger, rage, confusion, compassion, sadness, and tears.  I wish I could thank all those, like Don Francis, Dr. Michael Gottlieb, Dr. Selma Dritz, Marc Conant, Dr. Dale Lawrence, Paul Volberding, and Dr. Arye Rubenstein, who tried so hard, against such overwhelming odds, to save lives quickly.  I would also chastise President Ronald Reagan and Merve Silverman and give Margaret Heckler and Bob Gallo a piece of my mind -- the skunks!    I am thankful that there are politicians like Orrin Hatch and people behind the scenes like Bill Kraus and Cleve Jones.  Though he was woefully slow in responding I'm grateful for the response of C. Everett Koop and that once having made his stand he never wavered and took it to the media wherever he could.    Randy Shilts did an excellent job of showing the culture in the United States and France and the politics in the medical and scientific communities and the political posture and arena during the 1980s.  He also humanized the crisis by following many of the patients from onset of medical problems to death (Enno Poersch, Gary Walsh, Frances Borchelt, Bill Kraus, and Gaetan Dugas) and by following the doctors and scientists in their fight to discover the properties of this terrible disease and conquer it.  It was enlightening and helpful to have the book structured as a time line.    The amount and variety of research done for this book is astounding, requiring Shilts to conduct hundreds of interviews and read millions of pages of articles and medical material.  In reading this book, my education has been enhanced and my life is more full and forever changed.    It is a great tragedy that AIDS killed Randy Shilts as it had killed so many other innocents, and that as I write this there is still no cure for AIDS.  As far as I can tell, it is again being largely ignored by governments and the medical community.  Where will the next Randy Shilts, Bill Kraus, and Dr. Gottlieb and the other saviors come from--and will they come soon enough?+books
Tremendous overall value+P+Excellent resourse!  One of the very best, single volume theological dictionaries available.  For the size, one of the most concise packages of information.  If your interest is in theology, this would be an excellent  choice+books
What we know about constraints on population growth+P+Obviously, the population of the world has been growing dramatically for the past few centuries.  How high can it go?  At how high a level can it be maintained?   What restrictions are placed by the available resources, such as food and water?    This book asks many of the right questions.  And it admits that we don't have all the answers.  But it does give some clues about where we may be headed.  Cohen shows that basically, if we want to support people indefinitely on 3500 kilocalories per day from wheat energy, with 9000 cubic kilometers of annual fresh water supply, well, we can support only 5 billion people.  We're already beyond that.  Right now, we're using up resources at an incredible rate.  And while the Earth could support 10 billion people in theory, it is hard to see how it could do that for long in practice.  The author thinks that we'll never get to the absolute maximum that the Earth can support.  Most people would all be right on the edge of starvation, and we'd simply be unable and unwilling to stay in that state indefinitely.  But I did realize after reading this book that we could stay at about 5 billion people for a very long time if we put our minds to it.  Standards of living would not be high, but they would be tolerable for the majority, and the ones who found such a life acceptable would keep having children who found it acceptable.  Those of us who have political views ought to wonder if time is on our side or not.  And that is why I think it makes sense to try to imagine what options are available for our mutual future.  That's why I think this book is worth reading+books
One of the best dog stories I have ever read+P+Willie Morris was a truly great author!  This story of his childhood with his dog was really heartwarming. It is so simple and warm and humorous, you will just love it.  Warning:  you will cry your eyes out at the end, but it's worth the pain.  One of the best animal stories ever, I hope many kids read this in school.  If you loved the movie "A Christmas Story" you will love this book.  The movie version of "My Dog Skip" is also quite good, though it is kind of upsetting that in order to create drama the wonderful father of the book is kind of nasty in the movie.  Willie Morris was a great author who also wrote a cat book entitled "My Cat Spit McGee" and several books about his life that remind me a little of Russel Baker's memoirs.  One is entitled "North Toward Home", another "Good Old Boy" and one is about life in New York City.+books
Very little action, and other problems+N+You have to read about 180 pages of this book before any action starts. I was frankly bored by the entire book. Once the action starts, it's fairly contrived. Reacher is one of those very lucky or very unlucky "heros." And if you're one of those readers who like to try to figure out who is doing the dirty deeds, you can't. There are absolutely no clues you can use to determine the perpetrators.  And who says the Secret Service doesn't act proactively? While this is one of the book's major premises, the history of the Service is filled with proactive activities to protect those who come under their care.  I remember once when the President came to my hometown and spoke on the Statehouse steps. Office workers in nearby buildings used telescopes to get a better view. All of them were seen by Secret Service agents and men with guns visited them in one big hurry. Radios were used in abundance. And this was over thirty years ago. Do you think the Service has become more capable or less capable since then? If a single radio was used in this story, the perpetrators would have been caught about halfway through the book.  When President Bush (the first one) wanted to walk across the Mackinac Bridge for the annual walk, they took over the entire hotel where he would be staying, and not because they needed the space. A list of others who would be in attendance during the walk and at the dinner the previous evening had to be vetted starting 6 weeks prior to his visit, including local police. They even kept the pitcher of ice tea that he would be drinking from in a locked box watched over by an agent (same with condiments). After spending a bazillion dollars up to and after the President's meal, the Prez graciously paid for his own meal, and left a nice tip. Big of him. So agents don't just show up a couple of hours or in one case in the book, a few minutes before the big event, and throw a cordon around him.   I was also left with some unexplained questions at the end.  So, it's dull, inaccurate, and an insult to those brave souls who protect our nation's leaders+books
I found this book to be very helpful...however,+P+I read the book from first page to last. I found it very helpful and inspiring. I found myself talking out loud about situations that were familiar to me and debating things aloud as well. I would definitely recommend the book, however, I am wondering if there are any in depth books out there. I guess I am looking for rules, regulations, and suggestions in that area. I know that they, of course, vary by region, state, county, city etc....  Thanks!!  Tamm+books

Amazing Story+P+The book The First Part Last by Angela Johnson is a story about a teenage boy and his life as a father.  In his sixeenth birhtday his girlfriend gives him some new that changes his life forever.  The story flips back and forth from present time to the past so you can predict at times why certain things are the way they are.  his story seems very realistic compard to what many teenage fathers go through.  In the story he finds it hard to balance his school work and taking care of the baby, especially since his parents do not heop much.  Finally he ends up breaking down and gets in trouble for it as well.  This book shows the struggles of teen pregnancy and what many teen fathers and mothers go through.  If you enjoy this book you would probably enjoy the book Hanging on To Max as well+books
Good start+P+I've used some version of this book for many years now, and I've seen it evolve.  I think, as other reviewers have said, that there are some simplified portions of the book, especially those parts dealing with monetary economics.  There are other portions which lay out the principles as only these authors can, and those parts are extremely helpful and valuable.  This book allows me to teach my notes and thoughts with a textbook serving as a reference and an introduction -- it doesn't get in my way, in other words.  I use it along with several other texts, and I think it gets the job done.  Students seem to like it as well, mainly for its clarity.  For someone wanting to learn the basics, this is an excellent choice+books
Save the money you have!+N+This book is totally useless.  I've contacted several places listed in the book to no avail.  This will NOT help you make money and does not lead to any &quot;free&quot; money anywhere.  Keep the money you have+books
A modern masterpiece+P+Dispossessed and alienated by the death of his grandfather, the divorce of his parents, and the imminent sale of the ranch where he grew up, 16-year-old John Grady Cole heads for Mexico with his friend Lacey Rawlins to pursue the lives of traveling horsemen.  They find a hard, Darwinian world where the weak and foolish suffer.  Cole is scrupulously ethical and strong-willed, and he needs to be.  Every time he shows love or compassion for another, he is made to suffer for it, and only his own strength of character allows him to persevere.  Cormac Mccarthy's prose style is challenging at first, but I soon grew accustomed to it.  His long galloping sentences effectively emulate the rhythm of travel, and his simple yet often startling turns of phrase bring the landscape of the Texas/Mexico border region to vivid life. +books
A great, exciting book, it put me in touch with what my dad must have gone through+P+I wish my dad was still alive to see this book, and that I could talk to him about it. He (Robert H. Hofer) was a Machinist's Mate on the Santa Fe for most of its career, and I remember hearing him describe the saving of the Franklin, and seeing steel burn as the Franklin's magazines exploded and showered the deck of the Santa Fe with fire; and also what it was like to work down in the engine room while the ship manuvered off the beach at Iwo Jima, exposed to shore fire. The descriptions in this book are incredibly vivid and exciting, and answer a lot of the questions I wish I could ask my dad today. Forgive any errors of fact -- maybe the author has read all the reviews and will put out a revised version in the future. If you've ever wondered what it must have been like to be 19 years old, in the middle of the Pacific, fighting the Japanese in the biggest naval battles in history, then you've got to read this book+books
Wish I had known...+N+I don't care how great this book would have turned out to be if I had finished it.  Within the first 30 pages, Stephanie recalls the sex she had with the guy she's hunting down when she was 6 and he was 8 years old; and her Grandpa Plum shooting a grossly neglected family pet to end the animal's pain and suffering. If I had known about the distasteful elements in this book, I would never have purchased it+books
An Unabashed Love Letter To Liberals &  The Democratic Traditions+P+I read this book in the audio form against my will for a political book club.  I thought to myself,  "Oh great!  Another liberal tome, telling us liberals how we went wrong and how we need to learn to strategize. blau blau blau..." Instead, I was transported into an America of my dreams, lovingly cradled by Mr. Reich's comforting and hopeful vision of America.  Possessed with a masterful narrating voice, Mr. Reich connects the reader to our rich, democratic traditions and applies these tried and true values to our current problems.  He makes it sound so easy.... I found myself wishing that he was our president.  When I told this to a friend of mine, she noted that "He's probably too short." I didn't give it 5 stars because I didn't agree with some of his views on globalism and I thought he was a little too pollyannaish for these times.   If our elected officials would just sit down, read this, and follow the instructions, America would look more like the America that we all claim that it is.  Hopefully, some future president will have this wise and wonderful man on his or her side in the whitehouse again.   +books
Nothing Special+N+I had rated this book a "two" in relation to other Koontz books I have read. The book is entertaining enough, but is not very unique in relation to other books that Koontz has written. Koontz appears to have somewhat of a formula when creating main charachters. Often there is a primary charachter who appears to be rather basic at the beginning, but through later description becomes more complex due to an unusual background. Koontz books often have the aforementioned charachter utilize their unusual background to overcome difficult obstacles usually in order to save a loved one.   I believe Koontz tries to express certain generalties, some of which have moral and religious undertones:  In the end, good overcomes evil and often evil by its destructive nature, destroys itself.  Love is worth fighting and dieing for.  Love is stronger than evil.  What does not kill you, makes you stronger.  Evil knows no socioeconomic boundaries.  The key to happiness is love, not material gain.   Evil lurks where you least expect it+books
Over Long & Repititious+N+Somebody get this guy an editor!  By the time I got to the end of this book if I read "You wouldn't be wrong ..." or about someone  lighting up a cigarette one more time, I was ready to throw the damn book out.  Turtledove used to be great but if this book is any indication you wouldn't be wrong if you lit this book on fire with the match you used to light your cigarette and never picked up another Turtledove book.+books
A wonderfully twisted book.+P+I've read this book a few times, and it never fails to amuse me with its intricately woven stories, wicked satire, and twisted plots.  Perhaps it's not everyone's cup of tea (as other reviews have shown) but I loved the mix of 19th century convoluted plotting (a la Wilkie Collins or Palliser's own Quincunx) and send-ups of modern literary theory, in the form of a literary critic cum cult leader, and such luminaries as Jeffery Archer, seen here as an egotistical politician turned plagarist.  I am not a fan of books as puzzles, but this is no postmodern deconstruction of fiction;  it's just a funny take on a thematically linked short story collection+books
Bad book from a mad communist+N+Here in Brazil, about ten years ago, I tried to read this bad book, but I never finished it.I tried to read, one book printed in Argentina, wrote in spanish.This book is bad about even guerrilla warfare. In fact, never any of the tatics describe in this book gave victory to any army or revolution.The sucess in Cuba, came not from victory in battle.In fact, never happened a single battle in cuban revolution.It came from the cowardy of Batista and his mafia's government. Ever when an army or even mercenaries TRIED to defeat Che Guevara, they got it, very fast and whith no dificulties.This happened in Congo, to exemple.Finally, in Bolivia, who wasn't and never was a military power, Che was ridiculous at guerrilla.Even so, Che Guevara was easily defeated in Bolivia, and murdered soon after surrendered in 1967. In fact, any guerrilla in this world got any military victory, using Guevara's tatics and theories. Many parts of Latin America had communists taking power, but in any of then using guerrilla warfare. The ever used Gramsci's theories and books to take the power. Brazil is an exemple.Our communists tried some guerrillas, using Cuba's money and support between 1960 and 1974.All of then were easily and fast defeated. After all, our left has total control of this coutry, but from press, scools, TVs, etc. control. As Antonio Gramsci wrote in 1930's Italy, when the left controls the intelectuals, the media, the school sistem, all society is put under left's control without a single shot. This happened in Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia, Venezuela,etc+books
Edge of Evil+P+A somewhat unusual J.A. Jance read.  Edge of frightening.  Good writing.  Hard to put down+books
much to much introspection+N+I agree with the reviewer who said this work is boring. It seems Roth is trying to glorify Philip Roth and not the characters. He goes on and on describing the overwhelming feelings zuckermann has for "the swede", without letting us know who the Swede really is. Roth should let the characters tell the story or try to use less erudition in his narration. It gets to the point where the reader loses interest in finishing the book. I loved the plot against american because it was more character based than philosophizing about about the historical context of the times+books
125 best cupcake recipies+N+there are a lot of original and wonderful flavor ideas.  many of the recipies are quite pricey to make due to the liberal use of dutch cocao powder.  the basic cake recipie on which most of the cupcakes are based makes a rather dry cake that has a rough texture.  the basic frosting recipie is too dense.  i like the flavors but not the recipies.  i have adapted the basic cake and frosting recipie making the end products much lighter and airier, with good results+books
A review on the author+P+Although the book is great, it speaks for itself and I'm not here to review it.  I emailed the author, or someone who works with her, at the email address I got from Jan's website.  First of all, a little background.  I have a two-year-old border collie/lab who I've had since he was seven weeks.  I adore him.  I have been working from home with the occasional temp job up until two months ago.  I now work 5 days a week outside the house.  I wrote to this person asking advice on certain things relating to walking the dog, and mentioned the hours my dog is being left alone while I'm at work.  My response was that I am &quot;selfish&quot; and unfit to have a dog.  This coming from someone who was once so clueless about raising dogs that she put one of her own to sleep.  I have been looking into getting a dogwalker for my pooch, which as a person concerned for dogs, she could have suggested.    But her only suggestion was my poor dog, I shouldn't have him.  Whereas the book is a good read with good methods, I would suggest a second thought before asking her or her staff any questions personally.  She, or whoever that was, is rather selective in the dogs she'll help according to what she thinks of their owners.  It was a negative experience trying to get any kind of advice from them.  Rather than pointing out something wrong and offering suggestions to rectify it to someone who is obviously open to change, she chose instead to say, Sorry!  Not interested!  Not at all what I had in mind for someone in her position and with her passion+books
Did not work for me.+N+I have been a big fan of Mr. Woods since "White Cargo."  His books are not great literature, but fun reads with interesting characters and the outcomes are never obvious.  This book fail in that I was not able to relate to the characters, too much sex with nothing to do with the story (I am not against sex but it should be relevant, not sensationalistic).  Well, you cant hit one out of the park every time.  If you Like Woods still of writing and storytelling you need to check out the cult favorite "Tourist in the Yucatan" cool thriller+books
Engaging look at a scary set of diseases+P+Deadly feasts: tracking the secrets of a terrifying new plague by Richard Rhodes is one scary book. It tracks the discovery of prions, the mishapen proteins responsible for mad cow disease, scrapie, and Creutzfeldt Jacob disease. Following human cannibals in the jungles of New Guinea in the fifties, bovine cannibals of the British Isles in the eighties, and the bizarre history of sheep scrapie from the 17th century on, Rhodes does a great job of presenting the history and discovery of this bizarre group of diseases. I especially enjoyed the characterizations of the scientists, from the Noble Laureate who so enjoyed the New Guinea that he often regretted rejoining civiliziation, yet brought thirty natives back to the USA and helped them through school, to the hyper-competitive scientist who named the molecules even though he wasn't quite certain what they were.   But this isn't just a story of scientific discovery. As the foreboding subtitle blares, Rhodes explores some of the scarier aspects of prions. These include spontaneous formation, responsible for the known early cases of Creutzfeldt Jacob disease, trans-species infection, including mad cow disease and scrapie, the long long incubation period and lack of immune system response, and hardiness of the disease. One scary factoid: a scientist took a sample of scrapie, froze it, baked it for an hour at 360 degrees (celsius), and was able to re-infect other animals from this sample.   For all the uneasiness this book inspires, it certainly doesn't offer any answers. A condemnation of industrial agriculture, a warning that it's unknown whether vegetarians are even safe, and a caution against using bone meal for your flower garden do not make a recipe for handling this issue. To be fair, it was printed in 1997--perhaps things are under control now.  +books
What might have been....+P+The subtitle of the book, "The Friendship That Won The Civil War" would imply that there really was a friendship, and indeed it seems the relationship between Grant and Sherman was destined to create a winning duo. That makes it unique, not just because of the resultant Union victory, but it really does stand out as the one relationship among the senior leadership of both sides that was capable of creating the kind of synergism necessary to win the struggle. The only other comparable relationship was Lee and Jackson, which was every bit as successful, but didn't survive the war. There are too many anectdotes in the book to mention, but I can say that I learned a lot more than I had previously gleened from separate biographies. Grant was clearly a victim of disappointing performances by subordinates, Sherman being a glowing exception. And Sherman's armies needed the type of visionary leadership that ultimately unleashed them to win. Yet the contingent nature of the events leading to the monumental victories are pointed out again and again. Such were the nature of promotions and military politics in the day. A fast paced read. The relatively quick descriptions of the battles are much appreciated. If Grant and Sherman seemed like inspiring characters before, Hood's book will convince you that the story of their friendship not only won the war, but had a profound impact on 19th century America well beyond 1865+books
Don't buy this book!+N+If you're going to read one of the great classics of literature-and you should-don't pick up this edition.  It is a reprint of a version that dates back to the 1870s and was exposed more than 40 years ago for cutting nearly one-quarter of Verne's story and mistranslating much of the remainder.  Its reappearance in this edition is all the more amazing considering Tor's status as a leading science fiction publisher, and the company's willingness to perpetrate this fraud on is many readers is truly stunning.  If you want to truly get to know Verne's novel, pick up the elegant Naval Institute Press edition, in a modern, complete, updated translation, with commentary by the leading American Verne expert today, Walter James Miller.  That book also comes with many of the artistic engravings that illustrated the original French first edition (no illustrations are to be found in the B&N Mercier reprint).  Less attractive but more academic is the Oxford Classics version of Twenty Thousand Leagues.  This review is posted on behalf of the North American Jules Verne Society by Jean-Michel Margot, president NAJVS+books
Life Changing+P+Some of this is just common sense. But some of this was life changing for my family.   The chapters in this book build upon themselves and as they grow they develop the theme of families being worth the effort. There are stories of real life situations, quotes, examples and more.    One chapter is about making a plan and making a statement. And while I know this is based on a business type mode, we tried it. We made a Family Statement and it has been a large part of our lives. My children will recite it and use it as a reminder of what we expect of them.   It is a great book. One that will have a place on my bookshelves for many years to come.+books
Family Lessons From "The Inside Out "           +P+Covey encourages every parent to do some soul searching to become aware as to what really is priority in life. Then, he suggests we put "first things first." I believe that most parents would admit that they do wish to have "FAMILY" comes first--above all else. But, in today's busy, often stressful daily routine of life, accomplishing that goal is often "easier said than done". Covey clearly points out the essentials...such as establishing effective communication lines through family meetings and one-on-one talks with the kids. He makes so much sense as he describes with personal anecdotes how love, values, morality, and empathy for others is a process of teaching and learning from "the inside out"...in other words from within the family rippling out to society at large. He talks about establishing a family mission statement and helps to direct moms and dads to find the courage and the skills to make changes for the better. Covey's book creates the mindset and the outline. If you have young kids like me, I recommend a perfect compliment 'how-to book' with Covey's ... called "THE POCKET PARENT." This handy book, written for parents of 2-6 year olds, is loaded with compassion and humor along with over one thousand tips and skills to try. It literally trouble-shoots many of the problem behaviors we all deal with daily-such as Angry outbursts, Bedtime, Mealtime and Clean-up refusals, Tantrums, Disrespectful attitude, the "Gimmes", Morning "Crazies", Sibling fights, Whining and many more. These 2 books (one more theoretical, the other more "hands on" practical) have changed our lives. We now have more peace and cooperation in our family---and that gives us more time to enjoy each other. Consider both books for your home reference library. +books
Difficult to get through+N+Although the historical parts of this book are great, these moments are few and far between.  It seemed to me that this entire work was solely the author's attempt to justify why she did not have children.  Instead of standing up for her decision she makes it well known throughout the book that she missed her chance(s) to procreate.  This book is most likely for women who fall into that catagory and not for the determined childfree+books
Informative and interesting+P+This book isn't rocket science... But it is a great way to gain some sanity and understanding when your toddler is driving you mad.  It explains why children do what they do, and that in most cases, annoying toddler behaviors are important developmental milestones and NOT just a child being 'naughty.+books
Excellent Overview+P+I found the book to be excellent.  It accomplishes its main goals: to summarize the history of the world in an overview style.  If you want to get into deep history, you can take some of the sections and delve further into other annals.  As for other readers accusing the book of having a negative revisionist slant, I would disagree.  Modern scholarship is most definately revisionist, but that doesn't have to be a bad thing.  Revisionist history is only a bad thing when there is an agenda for personal gain.  To revise history based on new scholarship is a wonderful thing which can sometimes disprove earlier "revisions" to history+books
Who wrote this?+N+As a huge fan of Jim Henson, the Muppets, and Kermit the Frog I was hugely disappointed.  The recaps of Jim Henson's life and Kermit's were interesting, but the rest was trite nonsense+books
Ching's Architectural Graphics+P+This book is a great reference for architecture students and architects.  It shows in great detail drawing types and explains the uses for each of the types.  It is also very helpful at the beginning with explaining the tools for drawing and their uses.  I would recommend this book to anyone; it is a great tool for anyone in the field of design+books
Them pesky skeeters get a tale of their own+P+I don't recommend this book to the mosquito lovers of the world.  If you've a soft place in your heart for those buzzing swarming little blood-sucking fiends, you probably shouldn't peruse this particular book.  HOWEVER.  If you happen to enjoy a good "why" story from Africa, you could hardly do better than the lushly illustrated "Why Mosquitoes Buzz in People's Ears".    In a kind of Chicken Little series of events, a lying mosquito sets off a chain reaction ending, ultimately, in the sun no longer rising.  When the animals of the forest slowly track down the reasons behind the sun's disappearance, they eventually reach the conclusion that mosquito is the one to blame.  Ever since, mosquitoes will sometimes ask people whether or not "everyone" is still angry at them.  The answer is a satisfying (I love this descriptive sound) KPAO!  The illustrations are splendid.  During the day they are set against a white background.  By the time the sun disappears, they pop out of a black setting.  Kids will like finding the small smiling pink bird that cleverly pops up in every scene.  It's a fine fine text that bears more than a passing resemblance at times to the classic nursery rhyme "The House the Jack Built".  And who knew that the sound lions make when they laugh is "Nge nge nge"?  Not I, said the fly.  A lovely read+books
Disappointed+N+I was excited to get this book, since I am a stay-at-home mother of three.  I believe that it's important to take care of yourself and feel confident in your decision to be a mother.  This book didn't really give much advice.  It skimmed the surface with suggestions about dressing cute, exercising, taking time for yourself...things I've heard a thousand times before.  I like to hear real life tips on how other mom's do these things and more.  I thought the book was a rip-off with no real content.  A much better book, if you stay at home with your kids is Happy Housewives by Darla Shine. +books
NRSV Review+N+The cover is too floppy and the pages too thin.  This makes it difficult to flip between pages.  Also, in the middle of the book, the pages were cut incorrectly (they are folded over).  I would not buy this again and as a matter of fact, will need to buy another version to replace this+books
all encompassing+P+As a Texan who first moved to Europe at age 13 in 1961, Pell's book was like reading the story of my life. And yet it made me understand so many things that were always something of a conundrum (such as why the French looked down on everything American in general but adored the Kennedy's) to the sinister goings-on of the McCarthy era (they actually burned books  considered subversive in American embassies abroad, such as "works by notorious radicals like Mark Twain and Theodore Dreiser"). I got this book because I wanted to have a better understanding of why the U.S. is where it is today, and it more than filled the bill, in an all-emcompassing way.  Thank you, Mr. Pells+books
Just very odd......+N+This story should have and COULD HAVE been really good. It presents a great concept, but the story is just so poorly crafted. It is VERY sexist, the prose is stiff, and the plot is dull. I will concede that it was interesting at times; it kept me reading, but I really didn't get much out of it. I can only praise Heinlein for including the "intelligent conversation" which takes place after the press conference, where there is a great explantion on why the English language is so difficult to learn. The whole story is just very odd. Do read it though. It's a title to read if you wish to be considered "well read." Despite its faults, Valentine Michael Smith will be a character in literature that will never be forgotten, just as we will never forget Atticus from "To Kill A Mockingbird."+books
Master of figure and fantasy+P+This book collects a series of Boris' paintings, plus a few very detailed pencil drawings, done between 1979 and 1982. If you're not already familiar with Boris' work - well, you probably are whether you know it or not. He has done years work of book covers for Edgar Rice Burroughs, as well as reams of posters. The one constant through all his work is passion for the human form and human power, both male and female.  These paintings range from the lush and sensual to humorous or macabre. A hookah come to life has a demonic presence, but a bar of soap come to life (and licking the bather) is more charming and a little silly. Even the simplest pictures have overtones - that bather is truly a beautiful woman, leaving me just a little envious of such close contact. Maybe not envious either, but off in thoughts of my own. And the preface is right, 'erotic' is much too simple a word for all the different feelings and combinations of feelings that come from having or holding a strong, healthy body.  My only complaint is a sameness in the female figures presented. The faces are beautiful, long and elegant, but mostly the same. The figures - the one figure, really is beautiful, but I value the uniqueness of a figure and the differences between figures. Cloning can serve a narrative purpose, certainly, but sameness wears. Even the loveliness of Danielle Anjou, acknowledged as a principal model and collaborator, wears.  Boris is the master of the figure in fantasy art, and has been for many years. This is a great sample from an earlier time in his career. It's almost impossible not to like.  //wiredweir+books
Blown away by the audio version +P+This is my first full-blown experience with Virginia Woolfe.  I was always a bit too impatient, skimming over paragraphs of internal dialog to get to the plot.  What a difference an amazing narrator makes!  Yes, it is slow going at times, but the beauty of Woolfe's sentences make the focus on every word worthwhile.  Leishman treats Woolfe's words as poetry, and I started thinking of them as that.  For that reason, I disagree with the reviewer counseled against ten minute spurts -- at least in the audio version, the prose seemed so rich that it was hard to absorb more than a few minutes at a time.  It was only when I began to savor each paragraph on its own that I could truly enjoy this work.  This book is truly profound.  It has caused me to become more aware of my own inner life, and has changed the way I think about what it means to "know" another person.  Highly, highly recommended -- and this is from someone who spends a lot of time reading trashy chick lit and thrillers! +books
It would be funny if it weren't so sad+N+Probably the most (although certainly not the only) ludicrous part of this book is the entry on Caroline Higgins, a professor at Earlham College.  Horowitz objects to Higgins because she teaches a course on peace activism -- a course taken by students in the Peace and Global Studies program, at a Quaker college.  It seems odd, to say the least, for a supposed champion of religious freedom to object to people at a Quaker school voluntarily enrolling in classes devoted to a central Quaker value.  That Horowitz resorted to including such a weak objection, and one involving such a tiny private college, shows that he really must have been stretching to get his list to 101+books
Expensive, complicated, too fancy for me; Too much fish+N+More fish recipes than your normal cook-in-advance books. I didn't want to buy the book, but my cat spilled iced tea on the borrowed copy (helpful kitty). There were a few interesting recipes, but everything was way too complicated and expensive. I have since given my copy to a thrift store. If you enjoy cooking and eating gourmet recipes, but don't have the time, this might be for you. If you can borrow it at the library (via interlibrary loan if your branch doesn't have it) you can better judge it. I can't recommend it, because I found almost nothing appealing. But tastes are personal, and YMMV. Just keep the book away from iced tea and cats+books
iteration reiteration+N+back and forth and back and forth.  im happy.  im sad.  happy.  sad.  love him.  dont love him.  love him.  dont blah. blah blah.  we're poor.  we're not poor.  we're poor.   a series of a series of a series of deus ex machinas.  malamud's writing style is easy to slip into, and the story is addictive yet annoying (any pulp novel can be addictive).    spoiler    he rapes her and and spies on her undressing and it's ok!  (no, don't try to sell me any of that oh the author's not giving this his approval, no no no.  when there is nothing to contradict something, it's the same as saying it's ok.  the same as if someone writes a book where everyone is racist and there is nothing in the book to say that being racist is bad.  in this book there is nothing to say that raping someone is bad and that irks me.)    +books
American Pastor write about a non-self-help book about love, marriage, sex,  and God situated in Africa+P+This is an amazing book I recommend anyone from any culture.  It's not a book that tells you Dos and Dons, rather a journey of an American pastor who was preaching about marriage, sex, love and God in Africa.  I am especially impressed towards the end of the book when the good Christian African man, Maurice, asked weather if he was wrong as a 30 year old virgin to dumb his ex girl-friend because she was not a virgin.  Good for Maurice to stand firm before God against temptation.  But there are too many Maurice, justifying women who have a different path of life, which might be so wrong, but in needed for forgiveness and acceptance.  The books raises a lot of tough and true questions, which sometimes is hard for us to even form.  For me, it was tough for me to explain to my boy friend why I think it is problematic for him to not think about marriage, and keep saying that he will seek God first.  It's contradictory.  Do you not love a child because you want to love God first?  Both can come as a practice.  Practice how to love God and humble ourselves in marriage.  To serve one another, the best way to display our love for God.   In the book, another character, Fatma, a beautiful young women, just like the Samaritan woman who met Jesus on the way to the well written in the New Testament.  She and her 6 ex bf/husband, and still living with another man, non of them is her husband.  This beautiful woman could not see a way out, do not find a place in God even though she was searching.  This story of Fatma is also true to many women who became a Christian later in her life or was lost on the way as a Christian.  How women like that may think the best way out is to commit suicide, because her body and soul are wounded, so wounded and dirty, that, abandoning it is the only way out.  This is the best book so far I have read about sex, forgiveness, marriage, love and God.  It's not a self help book, but I would recommend to anyone in any age.+books
A lot of nothing+N+This book has very little to teach you and it's virtually unreadable. Make sure you read one or two pages before you buy in case you are like me and you can't stand his style+books
Disappointing+N+This was not the life-changing book it was touted to be. I have no major complaints, but the book was not helpful+books
Utterly Fascinating+P+This book is so lushly written that you can't help but feel as though you are watching these characters' lives unfold from their kitchen windows.  It feels like they are your friends, especially Margaret.  Max is a sweet guy, whose heart is in the right place.  Edie, I didn't care so much for.  The plot twist is surprising, if not a bit humorous with the running joke throughout the novel, and a little far fetched, but it doesn't hurt the book in any way.  This is a five star read all the way.  There are so many little details that Minot gives that toy with your emotions.  Things that a lot of authors would leave out or wouldn't think of to begin with that really give this book an added realism.  I was sad when it ended, but will definitely look for more books from this author+books
Great recipes, awful binding+N+I've reviewed this cookbook before from the point of view of the contents, for which I gave it 5 stars. I use this cookbook all the time and absolutely love it. Unfortunately, I use this cookbook all the time and the cheap glued binding has not held up. About half the pages have detached and I'm a few chapters away from having to pull the whole thing apart and put it in a three-ring binder. Interestingly, the same publisher used a sewn binding for the Babbo Cookbook, so I guess the gourmet recipes get the quality treatment. I would still recommend purchasing the cookbook for the wonderful preparations, but shame on the publisher for using such poor components on a book designed to be repeatedly opened and laid flat+books
"He could not think of a single major act he'd managed of his own accord."+P+Winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1985, this thoughtful character novel focuses on Macon Leary, a travel writer who hates to travel, a man who has gone through life observing what is happening, but who has never been truly engaged.  Compulsively tidy, Macon has always believed that it is possible to order one's life so effectively that the untidiness, or chaos, that throws life into confusion can be avoided.  And then his beloved 12-year-old son is cold-bloodedly murdered in the senseless robbery of a burger joint while he is away at camp for the first time.  It gives away nothing of the plot to say that this event totally undoes Macon and his wife, and their polite and predictable marriage goes into a tailspin.  When the novel opens, Macon and Sarah have decided to separate, with Sarah getting her own apartment (where she can be as messy as she wants) and Macon remaining in the house with his son Ethan's undisciplined dog Edward.  In fact, Macon has moved back with his sister and brothers in the family house, to recuperate from his physical wounds--an accident in which he breaks his leg-- and from his emotional wounds.  Then into his life comes Muriel, a divorcee with an over-protected, allergic, and hypersensitive son.  She is a dog trainer, a flake, the only person willing to undertake the task of civilizing the aggressive, sometimes vicious "pet" that lives with Macon.  As Macon tries to deal with his life, his loss of Sarah (who is dating), his son's dog (which attacks anything that moves), and his commitment to producing yet another travel book, his life becomes more complicated, and the depth of his relationship with Sarah, relative to the shared loss they have faced, becomes an issue which must be revisited if he is ever to engage with life and explore the possibilities of a new life which Muriel offers.  Filled with wonderful descriptions of life, both within Macon's family and in Europe, where he travels for research, the novel provides the reader with a full, realistic picture of marriage between people whose relationship has been, in part, the result of their commitment to their son.  Poignant and emotional, but avoiding melodrama, the novel explores the meaning of life and love, the extent to which a marriage may limit or stimulate the growth of the people involved, and the ways in which a marriage must adapt to the new needs of the participants if it is to endure through time. n Mary Whipple+books
Wolf in Sheep Skin+N+If you are a Christian, this book isn't for you. It is full of blashphemy, concluding that we must "... forgive God" and that we must love God "... even if He isnt perfect". Kusher even has the will to say that "...God would not be God..." without our love for Him. At one point he reduces God to an aminal saying that in the garden of Eden, when God said "...let US make man in OUR image" he was speking to animals and creation. Kusher explains that God created the world, and in the next paragraph that we came by evolution.    Since when was God in need of forgiveness? Isnt it that "... God so loved the world" and it wasnt us that loved God? I have no words in describing this book. It is full of error, because it does not base it self on the Gospel of Jesus Christ. All this book does is frees you from the thought that you are a sinner, and that it isnt your fault, and that actully you are a good person. Why do bad things happen to good people? Wrong question. There are no good people in the world in the first place. " for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God..." The world is in sin. The world DOES NOT HAVE GOOD PEOPLE!! Only by the grace of God, through faith in Jesus Christ you are made righteous. I beg you in the name of Jesus Christ to stay away from this book. It hasnt helped 4 million people, but it lied to them. Kusher, please turn from your ways and come to Jesus, then will you understand the life question "WHY"+books
Why three plot lines?+N+Candace Bushnell wrote "Lipstick Jungle" from the perspective of three different narratives:  Wendy, the movie executive, Nico, the editor of chief of Bonfire magazine and Victory, the fashion designer.   At times it gets sort of confusing who is who and the reader is left with the feeling that the author had three good ideas for three new books and somehow put them all in one.  It is interesting however, to see Selden Rose, a character from "Trading Up", reappear in this novel, good to know that he has recovered from the failed marriage to Janey Wilcox.    All in all the relationship between the three main characters remains unclear throughout the entire book, they just seem to be acquainted with each other for no apparent reason, occasionally talk or lunch together and talk about their individual lives.+books
Interesting book on understudied topic+P+De Becker's book is an interesting introduction to a topic that we rarely give critical thought to, namely our survival instincts, fear, and ways of coping with dangerous situations that most Americans are likely to face.  The dangers that De Becker talks about are more likely to affect women and celebrities (i.e. stalking, rape), but he also talks about robberies, teen suicides/murders, intra-family crimes of violence, etc.  He repeatedly talks about how predictable crimes are based on people's past behavior, as well as the simple measures we can use to determine whether or not strangers likely mean us harm or have intentions other than those stated by them.  My main critique of the book is that it sometimes came off like a big advertisement for his firm, which specializes in security services and consulting rather than as a guide for everyone.  Nevertheless I recommend the book, especially for younger and middle aged women.+books
Good!+P+Not the best Anne book, but good! :-) It's 'good' to see some conflict in Anne and Gilbert's marriage instead of the sweet but forced bliss in ANNE OF WINDY POPLARS and ANNE'S HOUSE OF DREAMS+books
The Highlight of the Five Volume Set (thus far...)+P+[...] This five volume history of the victorian bourgeois follows a freudian schematic: the first volume dealt with love, the second with sex, and this volume with agression.  This book was my favorite of the three I've read so far. Gay picks apart the Victorian penchant for cloaked agression with admirable scholastic fortitude.  His discussion of Foucault's theory of prisons is a high light for this entire five volume set.  His critique of what he calls the "social control" theorists is that they fail to take into account the ability of the powerful to delude themselves into thinking they are doing the right thing, even when they are most assuredly not.  Why stop here?  Only two more volumes to go..+books
Witty writing, fascinating story...maybe a little whiney+P+Sean Wilsey is certainly a skilled writer.  I found his writing style insightful, lively, and very funny.  The story of his childhood is jaw-dropping and if it weren't for his wit, this could  be a very uncomfortable story to read.  I enjoyed the suspense Wilsey builds into his story, which can be missing from memoirs.  He leads you along with his child's perspective to keep you turning pages and feel the same jolt he must have felt as a child living through this story.  My only real issue with this book was a nagging question in my mind on how much of it was the author working through his childhood pain and how much was revenge or whining.  Assuming the events described in the book are truthfully presented, I still had a difficult time accepting his parents as complete villains.  As he comes to a mild sort of acceptance of his parents' in the end, I felt I was left out of the journey.  Still, it is a compelling story with lively writing and well worth reading+books
Living large with an opionated dog+P+If I had used the "make the dog obey" theories and techniques on my opinionated male Great Dane, he wouldn't be here today. He is too big for me to "make" him do anything. He is also a sensitive beast and needs encouragement not punishment. I had to find ways that did 2 things: make it easier for him to do what I asked and offer him the rewards that HE values. Pat Miller's book showed me how to do that.  Pat's book gives the theory and the practical steps to apply to your dog. One book cannot cover ALL possible situations but as the basic primer for most dogs and their humans, this one does the job.  This book is the one at the top of my list. It's for people new to dogs and to those who want a way to train themselves and their dog into a more comfortable and complementary relationship+books
sisters in crime+P+The best thing about Case Histories is that it is not a murder mystery. Kate Atkinson's novel has many of the characteristics of a traditional murder mystery - sympathetic gumshoe, unsolved crimes, supernumerary suspects, and cats - but the story is more a study of the confusion inherent in the innocent interactions of sisters and daughters.   I was pleased by the lifelike, sympathetic presentation of the two male characters. Unfortunately the many female characters never lifted off the page.   The plot of Case Histories consists of three unrelated cold cases. All the dramatic tension of the book consists of the promise that these cases will be connected by their resolution. But this resolution fails to materialize. The detective solves one murder, the perpetrator casually confesses to a second, and the third is disclosed only in an anonymous flashback. And the cats live happily ever after+books
pretentious garbage+N+i tried reading it, and made it about 3-4 pages.  i'm pretty sure that's a bad sign.  i seem to recall mr. sedaris writing about his mother's bedpan or something.  the impression i instantly got was "BEEP BEEP!  PRETENTIOUS YOUNG WRITER PEDDLING SO-CALLED BAD CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES FOR FAME, MONEY AND SYMPATHY."  guess what, mr. sedaris?  i don't give a (expletive deleted) about your so-called bad childhood.  millions of people have bad childhoods and don't play the sympathy card.  check out augusten burrough's books, they manage to have humor and touching moments without this kind of pretentious style. +books
Not impressed+N+I have been a huge fan of Dean Koontz for years, ever since my mom got me to read Watchers.  But this story is just way too slow.  Just when I thought it was going to grab my attention and start off for the rollar coaster ride....it would slow way down again.  I almost put it down halfway through the book, but I kept pushing along thinking that it would get better just around the corner.  About 2/3rds of the way through it got a little bit more entertaining....but I just felt like something was missing most of the time I was reading.  I just couldn't get into the characters.  I wouldn't recommend this book to any first time Dean Koontz reader because it would most likely turn you off....don't judge his work by this novel. +books
Too broad and lacks depth+N+This is something for a new manager with little experience in not only systems administration but supervision.  This book may give a clue to someone who has just stepped into such a position but provides little depth and direction.  Unfortunately, there isn't any one book out there as management is a very complex role that encompasses many disciplines, any one of which would be a volume in itself.  I was very dissappointed and I find the other reviews misleading+books
If You've Decided to use VSTO, an Excellent Place to Start+P+VSTO (pronounced Visto) is a most interesting product when viewed from Microsoft's overall standpoint. It is a very carefully crafted product with the primary purpose of continuing Microsoft's continued dominance of the desktop marketplace, and a part of Microsoft's thrust to move more heavily into the server marketplace.    As best I can tell, it works something like this. Microsoft recognizes that servers handling up web pages, processing mail, etc. are a huge market, but that Linnux owns a big percentage of that market. Consequently Microsoft came up with the .NET strategy. .NET is a bunch of subroutines (if you will) that are written to provides all kinds of utility to programmers. You write your applications using propriatary programming languages such as C# and J# that use the .NET library and consequently have to run on Microsoft operating systems.   In the Office environment, packages such as OpenOffice have gotten to be pretty good, are basically Microsoft compatible so you don't have a re-training problem, and are FREE. I don't know how much success OpenOffice has had, but it appears to be enough to attract Microsoft's attention.   Enter VSTO. VSTO adds customization and productivity to Microsoft Office applications through 'links' that tie Office to the .NET framework. So to use VSTO first you must have and load the .NET framework, then you must load Visual Studio.NET - in that order -- then install Visual Studio 2005 Tools for Office.   All of this is clearly explained by Mr. Bruney in this book, who then goes on to do an excellent job of explaing how to write programs using VSTO. As examples he includes some real world applications. Most of the book is on Excel applications, but Word and Outlook are included as well. Finally he concludes the book with an excellent discussion on pivot tables.   Conclusion: A well written, understandable and complete book on VSTO. If you're going to be using VSTO, this is an excellent place to start+books
Overkill, Indeed+N+I completely agree with the reviewer who deemed this novel "overkill" with regards to the puppy mill preaching.  Those of us interested enough in dogs to pick up this book and read it are already well aware of the puppy mill industry.  This choir member did not appreciate being preached at for 45 pages of a novel that would have been better spent with more plot development.  Also, I got a little weary of all the explanations of dog training and AKC show terms and slang.  Again, those of us interested enough in dogs to pick up this novel already know what UDX, CDX and OFA stand for.  Readers interested enough in dogs to pick up this book but do not know what BOB stands for, what "finishing" a dog means, or what an Open class is would probably take the time to find out.  I would have preferred a Patrick O'Brian appraoch in regards to the terms and slang.  Just throw 'em out there for those of us who know, and pique the interest of those that don't.  The way it turned out, however, is that one hundred and fifty pages of a 256 page novel were all either dog show terms explained, or extolling the evils of the puppy mill industry.  I am a bit amazed that Ms. Conant does not say anything at all about the average "backyard breeder" who knows nothing of breeding dogs and wants to do it simply because his dog has papers, who do just as much damage to a breed as puppy mills, if not more.  Go figure.  I have two other Susan Conant Dog Lover's Mysteries to read, and after this first, I am a little leery of even opening the covers+books
A must read+P+This remarkable, very readable book is written as a conversation between two women born in Beijing at the same time as the People's Republic of China. As the women explore the similarities and differences in their experiences--from housing arrangements, to elementary school, to their roles in the early months of the Cultural Revolution, to the years spent working in rural China--the reader learns about the wide range of what it means to have grown up in the PRC. The result is a reflective, thought-full, and nuanced look at this tumultuous period in China's recent history+books
A sad, sad book+N+This book is not even up to the level of smear.  It is a shame that people could write such trash and make money off of smearing a good and honest man. Please do not wast your money and reward these political hacks+books
A wonderful book+P+I read this book in one sitting, and when I was done I found myself going back through it again in order to digest it more completely.  I really wish it had been available when I was just starting my family, but even though my kids are now older I don't feel it's too late.  A wonderful resource for any two-parent household, full of practical advice and suggestions on how to improve the whole family's quality of life.  Julie Shields cuts through to the heart of many emotional, complicated parenting issues and presents solutions from a fresh, logical perspective.  This is not just another book telling women how to reduce stress in their lives by making time for relaxing baths.  I highly recommend it to any parent, or anyone thinking of becoming one+books
Miller's finest work to date!+P+"Decomposition" is by far J. Eric Miller's best work yet.  His "Animal Rights and Pornography" collection of short stories was only a glimpse of his truly remarkable storytelling.  With "Decomposition" we see Miller at his best.  The story's pace never falters as the reader is pulled into the mind of the tale's protagonist without ever wanting to look back.  This was a great read!  I definitely recommend this book! CK Gaunt+books
His Dark Materials Trilogy+N+I have had these books on my shelf for a number of years, having never gotten around to them.  They should have stayed on the shelf, as I now know.    I read a lot of sci-fi and fantasy, so I recognized many of the tropes that Pullman tries to pull off.  I must say that Holly Lisle pulls off the multiverse much better than he does, and that's not saying a whole lot.  Like most people here, I found myself drawn in by the first book.  That one was well written, if a bit heavy handed in how good Lyra was, how brave she was, how she could do anything even if it was previously impossible for anyone else to do - like break her father out of his Svalbard prison.  However, the books declined in quality from the first page of the second book.  Will takes it much too easily when he finds that he has committed his first murder, especially for a boy of 12.  As a reader, I am willing to suspend belief quite a bit, but this particular plot point snapped that thread for me.  Once that was lost, it was extremely difficult for me to engage myself with the text once again.  As far as the ending goes, what a disappointment.  It seems as if the third book was trying to tell three vastly different stories.  Frankly, if Pullman had created a novel entirely about Mary Malone slipping into the world that she did and studying it in a scientific capacity with no way to return, that would have kept my interest much more than his rabid defamation of Christianity.  Also, Pullman fails to deliver on the cohesion of comparing Mary to the serpent, Lyra to Eve, and Will to Adam.  There was no offering there by Mary of something to tempt Lyra with as happened in the Garden of Eden.  Without this crucial component, there is no way that Lyra can be Eve reincarnate.   The propaganda that Pullman purports as truth would be all right if he was claiming it as his own, and that if others believed it, that would be okay.  However, he very cleverly lulls the uncareful reader into believing that what he is saying is a universal truth.  I had no idea that atheism was so nihilistic, yet that is the view I came away with when I finished this trilogy.   I would never recommend these books to anyone.  Rather, I would steer them towards better fantasy novels - like Rowling, Tolkein, Robin McKinley, Patricia McKillip, and Ursula K le Guin+books
Great Food That Is Also Great For You+P+This is a cookbook rarity in that every recipe in here is delicious.  I got this book when I was starting out trying to add soy to my diet for better health.  I only knew about tofu  and I wasn't very creative with it either.  This book showed me how to make delicious, healthy versions of foods I really love like Potatoes au Gratin, Soy Milk Pancakes, Soy Cheese Corn Bread, Pizzas and Focaccia, Cream of Asparagus Soup, chowders, chilis, desserts, stews, Kung Pao Tempeh, Tofu Lasagne, manicotti,Cajun dishes and even Tiramisu, just to name a few. This book teaches how to use all the different soy products with easy to follow recipes that will give your menu fresh delights based on foods you already know and love.  Each recipe has complete nutritional information.  There are addresses and phone numbers for soy product sources and places to write for detailed soy information of a general nature.  The author's information about the various soy products is a very understandable and helpful introduction to this often overlooked and misunderstood group of foods.  Her personal notes about each recipe help make the dishes seem like they came from a trusted friend's kitchen. The best way to make a change in your diet is to make the change as subtle as you can so that your old habits will not be so tempting.  These recipes will make you glad you added soy to your diet and your body and the environment will thank you+books
A REFRESHING LOOK AT BRITISH NAVAL HISTORY+P+Bravo for Mr. Herman!  His perspective on the affect of the British raj and, in particular, the navy on the development of the Western world is excellent and educational.  The phenomenon of a relatively small nation exerting its influence around the globe by extending its power through a superbly constructed and manned navy is, as yet, unmatched.  For fully two centuries, until World War II finally exhausted the potential, the British policy of open sea lanes and its enforcement thereof permitted the development of the New World through trade with the Old. This includes the United States, whose loss as a colony severely dented the Empire, but eventiually created the power which has succeeded Britain as world guarantor.  Mr. Herman is good on detail, but the real strength of the book is his explanation of how naval development and use affected the world as a whole. He is candid about the problems, both physical and political, and respectful of those individuals who, even in bad times, retained the foresight to keep the navy, and, thus, the Empire, on an even keel.  An excellent read for anyone interested in Western history+books
Bearly a quality book+N+I have read many of Anna Pigeon books.  This is my least favorite.  The mystery is not developed and thought about which Nevada Barr usually does well.  This was more of a book on bear/human relationship and a mystery (small) thrown in.  I did not enjoy it like and it was more of a chore to read it.  I highly suggest Superior Death or Endagered Species.  These two are Nevada Barr's best books+books
One of the best books on tai chi+P+This book presents the 24 and 48 posture tai chi form. The 24 move form is good for busy people, but the 48 move form is even better because it combines movements from the 3 most popular styles of tai chi, Yang,  Wu, and Chen, so the student gets some background in each. At 150 pages long in large paperback format, this book packs a lot of info between the covers. For example, I learned that in addition to the Wu style, there is also a W'u style, which I didn't know, although I've studied both Yang and Wu style tai chi.   The author gives a brief introduction to tai chi in the first chapter, discussing basic concepts and information, then proceeds to some classical Taoist philosophy. He also tells some interesting stories about the founder and his sons, who had many adventures and exploits, and various stories and legends have grown up around them.   Next there is a separate chapter on chi gung, a subject that has become almost a requirement for a tai chi book, I notice. However, most of the book is taken up by athe chapter showing the martial applications and the 48 move form. Dozens of applications are shown, and the photos are clear and easy to understand. I found this the most enjoyable part of the book, as there are still postures I don't know all applications for, such as snake creeps down, and the author presented one on that.   There is a chapter on guidelines for tai chi practice that gives detailed instructions for how to use the different parts of the body, from the eyes to the feet in performing the form. I found this useful because sometimes I still forget some of the fine details of how to hold the body when I do the form.   Finally, there are several appendices which provide a list of the 24 and 48 postures and their translations, a glossary on Chinese terms that is more complete than most, and a brief bibliography for further reading. The book is well written and easy to understand even when discussing some of the more abstract and esoteric principles. There are two mini-biographies of each other, two prefaces by two different masters, and a preface by the notable Dr. Yang Jwing Ming+books
excellent reference+P+Like other reviewers, I agree that a book is no substitute for instruction by a teacher.  Nevertheless, this comes as close (for the Yang style short form) as anything I've found.  Even if you have no interest in the martial aspects of taiji, having the potential applications of the form enriches practice.  I found the illustrations clear.  I own a half dozen or so books on taiji, and this is the only one I regularly consult+books
Inane and annoying+N+When traveling, I always try to take location appropriate literature along.  This seemed to be a particularly good choice for a visit to Venice.  Long after returning from the vacation, I'm still trying to force myself to finish this book.  It is self-indulgent and inane.  If the use of the phrase "don't be rough," (I could never figure out what was rough) over and over and over again is not enough to encourage throwing the book in the fire, then abundant use of "I love you, whatever that means," should do it.  I usually like Hemingway, this book is awful+books
St. Giles beond compare?   Please.+N+I have to agree with Anna Hope's review.  This book was so painfully lame that I gave up on it two-thirds of the way through and stopped wasting my time...something I very rarely do.  But this book, while starting excitingly, soon dwindled into boredom and I realized that I could definitely put it down.  I didn't care about the two main characters nor what happened with the storyline.  As far as St. Giles being beyond compare, try Kresley Cole.  Now THAT's writing; her books I hate to put down+books
If you would like to see how a psychic lives her life and how+P+her abilities affect her, then this diary will interest you. Ms. Choquette comes across as a charming, friendly person whom one would love to have over for dinner. She writes about her parents (especially her mother) and how her large family was close and sort of quirky. She describes her early psychic experiences and her training with two teachers who open her abilities up even more and teach her about life.   The most enjoyable part of the book for me was the descriptions Sonia gave of clients, mostly from the 70s -- lime green hot pants, bouffant hairdos, tie-dyed t-shirts and platform shoes...those were the days...how did anyone get a date back then?    The only criticism I have about the book is that Ms. Choquette  mentions several times that her family was Catholic and religiously so. I do not doubt her family's religious sensbilities, but the Church teaches against almost everything that Sonia practices and believes -- reincarnation, clairvoyance, ascended masters, divination with tarot cards, spirit guides, etc. I don't think it is possible to be a Catholic in the sense of someone who believes in the dogmas of the Church and be a New Ager as Sonia is. She also says that she prayed the rosary before her readings and one of her teachers said that she would attract only good spirits that way, but she also needed to pray the Our Father. The rosary requires the recitation of the Our Father at least 6 times, so I was confused when Sonia said she then began to pray the Our Father as well. I wonder what rosary she was praying.+books
Wolf in Sheep Skin+N+If you are a Christian, this book isn't for you. It is full of blashphemy, concluding that we must "... forgive God" and that we must love God "... even if He isnt perfect". Kusher even has the will to say that "...God would not be God..." without our love for Him. At one point he reduces God to an aminal saying that in the garden of Eden, when God said "...let US make man in OUR image" he was speking to animals and creation. Kusher explains that God created the world, and in the next paragraph that we came by evolution.    Since when was God in need of forgiveness? Isnt it that "... God so loved the world" and it wasnt us that loved God? I have no words in describing this book. It is full of error, because it does not base it self on the Gospel of Jesus Christ. All this book does is frees you from the thought that you are a sinner, and that it isnt your fault, and that actully you are a good person. Why do bad things happen to good people? Wrong question. There are no good people in the world in the first place. " for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God..." The world is in sin. The world DOES NOT HAVE GOOD PEOPLE!! Only by the grace of God, through faith in Jesus Christ you are made righteous. I beg you in the name of Jesus Christ to stay away from this book. It hasnt helped 4 million people, but it lied to them. Kusher, please turn from your ways and come to Jesus, then will you understand the life question "WHY"+books
Nice sequal to an AMAZING book+P+YOu must own Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs...please go buy that...then if you love that, you can get this book - which is a really nice sequal..  recommended+books
Two surprises I didn't like+N+The text of this book was generally good - although it seemed padded out with a massive listing of model metadata.  The book comes with a CD.  The first surprise was, the CD does not include the Data Definition Language (DDL) for its sample models... there's an extra cost for that.  My question to the publisher would be, what good is the CD you provide for free? The second surprise is the illustrations.  There are plenty of them, but they look like they were done in a primitive graphics package - not in an enterprise modeling tool.  They author seems to have invented his own wierd set of conventions, including "foreign keys do not appear in the entities... that is duplicate information".  Before you buy this book, take a look at the illustrations of the models.  If you can live with the notation, maybe consider buying it+books
This is a great book!+P+This books makes the cutest models and manipulative things!  If you make lapbooks, or notebooks for your units this would be the thing to get.  There are things here I have seen nowhere else.  It is adaptable up or down to the grade level it shows.  Perfect for homeschooling. I have used some of it in a group as well+books
Incredibily unpleasant read+N+I have been a huge fan of the Anna Pigeon mysteries.  The hard truth about Hard Truth is skip it.  It is a very unpleasant experience.  The graphic representation of child abuse and cruelty in this book still makes me ill.    What I've loved about the Anna Pigeon series is that I felt like I got a good sense of the national park where the story took place with an appreciation for the natural beauty of the area.  I doubt Anna spent more than a night in Rocky Mountain National Park.  Not only does she completely miss the unique character of the park but the park has no necessary link to the story.  The whole thing could have taken place in urban Chicago.  I have been picking up Nevada Barr books as fast as I could find them.  This book, however, was truely repulsive.  I'll be much more cautious about investing a part of my life in her next book+books
Informative but poorly organized and biased+N+Albert Hourani's A History of the Arab Peoples is a widely regarded general history of the Arab world. This is too bad, since as history the book is of low quality, with significant problems of organization and, where relevant to Hourani's apparent biases, factual accuracy. It does have its redeeming elements, but on the whole is for a variety of reasons not a reliable source as a general history of the Arab world, especially for the beginner.  Being the author of a general history of the Arab world myself, before I explain why I evaluate the book negatively I would like to suggest some alternatives, lest I be accused of attacking a rival publication out of self-interest. Philip K. Hitti's The History of the Arabs is a very detailed history which runs from pre-Islamic times to the 19th century. Arthur Goldschmidt's Concise History of the Middle East covers Turkey, Iran and Israel as well as the Arab world and is well-organized for beginners. It was the first general history of the Middle East I read as an undergraduate. Bernard Lewis' The Middle East focuses more on concepts and the flow of history but is also appropriate for those without a strong background in the region.  This book was first published in 1991. This review is based on the 1992 paperback version by Warner Books.  The initial weakness of this book begins with the very first chapter; although containing 458 pages of main text, Hourani's history devotes a mere seven pages to the pre-Islamic period. This is pretty amazing, for anyone familiar with that period, since Arab history prior to Islam is roughly as long as Arab history after it. Exactly how far back Arab peoples go in history is a matter of dispute, but certainly there were people one could call "Arabians" as far back as the beginning of the first mellinnium BC, or 1,600 years prior to Muhammad. The evidence is sporadic for sure, and no writer would give it equal prominence with later times, but seven pages is pretty paltry.  One might suspect an Islamic bias here, but the problem continues in the key early periods of Islam. The life of Muhammad and his immediate successors who established the basis for the Muslim world, spanning about a half century from Muhammad's first vision to the death of his son-in-law and successor Ali, get only 11 pages. The first Arab empire, the Umayyads (661-950), gets seven pages, and the Abbasid Empire (750-circa. 945), which is usually thought of as the "Golden Age of Islam," gets only six. This means 37 pages for the first 2,000 years of Arab history, including its framing epoch, and over 400 pages for the next 1,000. This would leave the uninitiated reader entirely without much sense of proportion.  What makes this book highly unrecommended for the beginner is its weak sense of organization. The middle time period between the collapse of Abbasid authority - roughly AD 950 - and the ascendance of the Ottoman Empire over the Arab world in 1517 is intrinsically a difficult time period to understand and a more difficult one on which to write a history. This is due to the fact that rather than there being one dominant power or a few powerful states, there is instead a multiplicity of dynasties with genuine authority in some areas not extending beyond the town level with a multifarious mixture of Sunni and Shia, Arab, Persian and Turkic ruling groups, not to mention the Latin states. Hourani makes no serious attempt to help the reader keep all of it straight by moving from a chronological approach prior to 950 to a topical one. There are ten chapters covering this time period and the social history of part of the previous two periods (the Umayyads and the Abbasids). There is one chapter which discusses the major power struggles of the time. If you want to understand the relative historical roles of the Buyids, the Fatimids, the Zengids, the Ayyubids, the Mamluks and their contemporaries, read something else.  It is within these ten chapters that this book contains its major strength - its "social history," or its description of the development of the Arab world. In fact I cited Hourani on the social history sections of my own book. In this regard, Hourani really is better than the alternatives. Over 200 pages of the book is devoted to detailing various aspects of how the Arab world came to be prior to the Ottomans. So for those who have already read a general history of the Middle East or the Arab world and want a more specialized knowledge, these chapters are quite useful.  I have several objections to how this book handles a variety of issues of current interest. This book was written during a time period when there was a great emphasis on negating certain negative images of Arabs and Muslims, to the point of deemphasizing any aspect of the Arab world which might be interpreted negatively. The word "jihad" doesn't even have an entry in the index, although it is used, or perhaps, misused. On page 247, Hourani describes a traditional view stipulating that the ruler has an obligation "to pursue jihad by maintaining the strength of the kingdom's defense..." This gives a misimpression, because legally jihad has two military meanings - the defense of Muslim lands and the Muslim community's collective obligation to spread Islam through conquest. Although jihad has a spiritual as well as martial application, its use is overwhelmingly in the military context, and while Muhammad's battles probably could be described as defensive, the vast majority of military actions between that time and the 19th century involved offensive operations (the Christian counter-offensives known as the Crusades being a major exception).  More broadly, the single most influential Islamist movement of the modern age, the Wahhabis, get only a few scattered mentions, and there is no real indication of the wave of extremism which by 1991 had been felt for some time. The primary non-Islamist ideological influence, Marxism, is discussed of course, but the influence of Nazism during the 1930s and 1940s is left out. Nazi Germany is mentioned once in passing, and in the same paragraph on page 331 Palestinian leader Amin Husseini is mentioned, but it isn't mentioned that he was a strong supporter of Nazis, that he moved to Germany during the Second World War and played an active role in the Holocaust, or that despite this he was made leader of the Palestinian cause by the nascent Arab League after the war.  Hourani's account of the 1967 is incredibly inaccurate, giving the impression that Egypt engaged in some bluster and then Israel started the war. He mentions Nasser's demand that the UN clear out of the Suez Canal zone, and includes the defense pact with Jordan, but omits a key fact - the mobilization of Egyptian forces in the Sinai. Once Egypt did this, Israel had no choice but to attack, because of its small population its economy could not handle an extended mobilization, while Egypt could. Hourani also doesn't mention the statements by Arab leaders to the effect that all Jews would be wiped out in the coming war.  On the whole, this is a useful book if one already has a framework understanding of Arab history and if one understands the slant that is being presented on issues of contemporary concern. Otherwise, I do not recommend buying it+books
Chain of Emtotions +P+This book masyerfully unmasks the sorrows of the nation. The author is able to compose a memoir of the haunting lives of children in New York's ghettos. The fierce images of rat-infested homes, and schools filled with poisonous lead walls leave readers unable to fathom how people truly exist in such harsh conditions. Kozol addresses every area of the spectrum from the children's point of view to the political views of the country. Also presenting an array of diverse issues such as AIDs, drugs, underage prostitution, death, motives based in moral, religious beliefs, and inhuman treatment towards others to the reader. Feelings of pathos arise after hearing the accounts of the children in the area; readers feel sorrow for the children because they are stripped of their childhood. Numerous quotes and examples are given in the book, but one that particularly struck me was when Kozol asks one of the children if he knows anyone happy at all the boy candidly responds, "Not many...Well, to tell the truth, not any who are happy for more than one day...No! Not for one day. For 15 minutes...Not any. That's no lie"(212). To honestly not know at least some form of happiness is incompressible for me and I'm sure for many others as well. By using statements made by children the author easily wins the readers pity and sympathy. Our pity soon turns to anger when he describes the lack of government support. Examples such as unsanitary hospitals, toxic incinerators, closet sized school rooms, and shabby, less then adequate housing evoke sentiments of detest towards the government's lack of aid towards these poor devastated people. But once again Kozol quickly changes our feelings to those of denial. He provides shocking statistics and first hand accounts as to how the nation sympathizes with these people for five minutes and then continue on with their lives.  It seems shocking that people would do things so cruel such as disposing of their waste in the ghetto streets. While reading, it became a necessity for me to remind myself that the events taking place were all true; this is not a cleverly composed work of fiction, though it would certainly be far more assuaging if it were.      Taking into account the brilliant components of the book, I must say that I was vexed by one minor detail; Kozol's overall presentation of his opinions. The beginning of the book revolves around the accounts of parents and children within the area and the author provides few opinions on the subject. But towards the end he fills several pages with statistics followed by passages of his opinions. I feel that this takes away from the book because rather than focusing on the children and people living in the area we turn our attention to the author and how he is impacted by the events and things he witnesses.        Other than this minor dislike I think that the piece as a whole is very informative and certainly does a good job at presenting what appears to be the ideas and realities for several minorities in New York. It may not be a thriller, or adventure novel, but it most certainly is a mystery. A mystery as to how people are able to survive in such hostile conditions and retain hope. Kozol's mastery of rhetoric reveals that the issues taking place have been around and that until something changes they will remain so.  +books

McJihad vs. Reality+N+This book is inexplicably influential, probably due to its catchy but ultimately meaningless title. Barber fails to convincingly analyze an interesting thesis, instead delivering an exasperating 300 page-long list of every single thing on Earth that he disagrees with. Barber contends that natural human political behavior results in smaller and smaller ethnic enclaves trying to separate themselves from the larger world, while unchecked global capitalism is erasing ethnic flavor with bowdlerized mass-culture sameness. Interestingly, Barber contends that these two contrary movements are actually in an unholy alliance, using each other's excesses as excuses for their anti-democratic behavior. That is a fascinating thesis, which makes the weaknesses of this book all the more infuriating.   The first part of the book is an interminable tirade of lists within lists, of cultural trends that Barber disdains, in an avalanche of complaints that is not analytical but merely selective and arbitrary. It's all tied together with attempts at "edgy" pop culture references, made-up terminology (like the annoying "infotainment telesector"), and pseudo-intellectual quotations and namedropping. All is lumped together unconvincingly under the anemic term "McWorld," which is so vague and all-inclusive as to become meaningless. In his never-ending examples of how recent cultural trends are damaging the freedom and intelligence of the masses, Barber merely comes across as a condescending snob who thinks his own interests are superior, or a curmudgeon who thinks everything was better back in the good old days, or both. In the second part of the book, Barber proceeds to throw obtuse political science theories at various world hotspots, in which tribalism and separatism are damaging the integrity of nation-states. His umbrella term for this phenomenon is the dangerously loaded term "Jihad." Note that this book was published back in 1995, so that word was not as prevalent in Western discourse as it is now, but Barber still uses the term as a loose descriptor which is likely to offend both devout Muslims and ardent anti-Islamists.  When it comes to the specifics, many reviews here and elsewhere list out the numerous flaws in Barber's arguments, and there are so many of them that a lot of reviews are necessary for the task. You can agree or disagree with various critiques of Barber's contentions based on your own personal politics. But everyone will probably conclude that in this book's final section he does not deliver on the ironic implications of his initially intriguing thesis (embodied in the book's title), and simply forwards borrowed theories on civil society and the public sector. Overall, this book is mostly the longwinded grumblings of a nostalgic know-it-all who portentously predicts doom for every single cultural and political reality of the modern world.

Dangerous misinformation+N+Suzanne Somers apparently has no use for modern medical science. Especially as a survivor of breast cancer (although of a very early stage) she is putting her life in grave danger by taking hormones. Recent studies have shown that women who were taking HRT for protection from heart problems actually had MORE problems than normal menopausal women. This is an unbelievably destructive, horribly dangerous book for people to take seriously. Being skinny is NOT more important than being alive. If you want to get the real scoop on hormones, talk to a doctor at an academic medical center (in other words, one that isn't going to mislead the public for personal financial gain) and see what she or he has to say. Chances are excellent that you'll be told to avoid them at all cost. Look at it this way: are you going to put your very life in the hands of Suzanne Somers? I'm sure she's a very nice person; it's just that she has no medical training whatsoever. *** writing from an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center**+books

&quot;Just Enough&quot; is more than enough.....+N+"Just Enough" is more than enough:  A turgid, pretentious, strident, and wholly unoriginal piece of work.  Its framework neither breaks any new ground in the study of the sociology of business or organization behavior, nor is it a particularly useful addition to the realm of self-help pop-business literature. At best, this might have been a reasonable ten page article in the Harvard Business Review, but surely not enough material for 280 pages!  Better to read &quot;Do What You Love, The Money Will Follow : Discovering Your Right Livelihood,&quot; by MARSHA SINETAR, and call it a day+books
The BFG is scriddliumptiously good!+P+The BFG is a children's book written by Roald Dahl, who wrote such classics as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Matilda, and James and the Giant Peach, and illustrated by Quentin Blake. The book was published in 1982 and immediately became popular amongst children and adults. The book won the Federation of Children's Book Groups Award in 1982 (UK), and was named one of the "best books of the past 20 years" by the UK's Good Book Guide in 1997.  The story is about an orphan girl named Sophie who, one night when she can't sleep, looks out her window to see a creepy looking giant blowing something into the windows where other children sleep. When the giant looks her right in the eye, Sophie jumps to her bed, and hides under her blanket only to be snatched by the giant and taken away to his home. It turns out that the scary giant is none other than the BFG, or the Big Friendly Giant, the only giant amongst the frightening human-eating giants who is a good giant, who satisfies his hunger on weird vegetables known as the snozzcumbers and drinks a delicious fizzy drink known as the frobscottle, which has bubbles that travel downwards that makes the drinker break wind instead of burp. The other giants are named The Fleshlumpeater, The Bonecruncher, The Manhugger, The Childchewer, The Meatdripper, The Gizzardgulper, The Maidmasher, The Bloodbottler, and The Butcher Boy. When Sophie asks the BFG about what he does at night, he reveals his secret of blowing bottled dreams, nice dreams, into the windows of children's bedrooms, something the other giants have no knowledge of.  When he catches a nightmare, he destroys it so that nobody will ever have to experience it. Sophie and the BFG become friends, and team up to rid the Giant Country and the world from the evil giants. So, the BFG mixes a dream showing what the giants do, which in turn becomes the worst nightmare the BFG had ever encountered, and takes it to Buckingham Palace and blows it into the Queen's bedroom, and leaves Sophie on the windowsill, for the dream includes the knowledge that she would be there when the Queen wakes up. When the Queen awakens after the frightful dream, she believes Sophie's story, speaks to the BFG, and works along with Sophie and the BFG to eliminate the child-eating giants.  The BFG is a character that the reader will automaticaly like. His unusual features, and nonsensical vocabulary, are both funny and very appealing to children as well as adults. Sophie is the young orphan girl who does an outstanding thing (saving the world from the evil giants), a theme that had been used by Dahl in other books like Matilda.   The book was very easy to read, and extremely amusing. Dahl's style and imaginative BFG dialogue tends to make children laugh and attempt to imitate. The story may also give the children a sense of fear or suspense (the description of the evil giants and what they do). Of course, the best thing about The BFG is the theme of good versus evil. It also shows that not just because someone might look unusual or scary means that that someone or thing is evil. In other words, you can't judge others by what they look like or how they look, but you can judge them only by their actions; a very useful lesson of life for children.  IMPORTANT NOTE: Some elements in the book may be offensive to some ethnic readers (Greeks, Turks amongst others).  Recommended  +books
My Infant Smiles Whenever He Sees This Book+P+We have enjoyed another of Eric Carle's books--Brown Bear Brown Bear What Do You See--since my son was a few weeks old.  So, when my son was about 7 months old, I bought From Head to Toe.  It was a wonderful purchase!  After a few reads, my son was imitating the animals just like his mama--waving his arms like a monkey and on his hands and knees like the cat.  It was so wonderful for me to see that my son was understanding and processing the books I read to him.+books
The Theory of Everything: The Origin and Fate of the Univers+N+It has come to our attention that the book "The Theory of Everything: The Origin and Fate of the Universe" has been published. Professor Hawking would like to make it clear that he has not endorsed this book. The text was written by him many years ago, however the material has already been published in books such as 'A Brief History of Time'. A complaint was made to the Federal Trade Commission in the US in the hope that they would prevent the publication. We would urge you not to purchase this book in the belief that Professor Hawking was involved in its creation. +books
The Best Fireplace Book+P+This is the best fireplace book I have seen.  First of all the book has hundreds of beautiful and varied fireplace pictures.  The pictures are great because they show the fireplaces in the home, decorated, and with the home furnishings around them.  They are all warm and inviting although very different.  The text of the book flows well also.  First it helps even a novice decorator find the styles that work with your personality and home.  Then it breaks down fireplace ideas by the different living areas in the house+books
Highly Improbable Theories+N+Considering the massive amount of publicity that this case generated, I couldn't imagine that there was anything left for a "new" book to present. Sadly, there really wasn't.  This book is chockful of unliklely possibilities being promoted by the defense attorneys and Scott's family. It reeks of denial and desperation.+books
Fascinating roller coaster to discovery+P+Andrew Solomon is a science writer who has taken the risky step of telling the vast, intriguing story of a deeply personal condition in the first person - which means that we follow him on an extraordinary roller coaster ride toward self discovery and healing (Solomon suffers very serious depression and tries all manner of "cures" including a death-wish desire to contract AIDS, and bizarre tribal rites in Africa) while also tracing the long tortuous history (and geography) of Depression as a subject. Our understanding of Depression, Solomon lucidly reveals, has been the subject of a centuries-long tug of war between two mindsets: those who see it as a chemical condition, and those who see it as a psychological (ie emotional) condition. As the history of civilisation veers between rational and romantic eras, so too has the understanding and treatment of Depression. Is it any wonder that a modern sufferer is torn between the talk-therapies and the chemical therapies such as Prozac?  Andrew Solomon comes down with an argument that both therapies are flipsides of the same whole - and that both have a role to play as sufferers seek escape from the bottomless black abyss. On the way he covers related subjects including Depression and suicide and Depression and creativity - and, this is the miracle of his writing and a tribute to his approach - the subject matter comes over as fascinating rather than gruelling.  If you are a sufferer, or live with one - or simply wish to know better how the human mind really works, this volume is pretty compelling. One of the best pieces of advice that Andrew Solomon cites is from a Greek philosopher who, more than 2000 years ago suggested that sufferers enjoy good wine and food, and surround themselves with good friends. A humane and enormously rich piece of science writing+books
Christian fundamentalism dramatized+N+Even the avid "trekie" reader of the Star Trek science fiction novels, movies and television series must suspend disbelief, when he finds Captain Kirk saying "Beam me up, Scotty."  But the biblical literalist reading this book need make no such effort, when he reads in this book that Jesus will effectively beam millions of true Christians up to heaven in the world-wide "Rapture."  Though the characters and their roles are fictitious, the book specifically references the relevant biblical passages for the believer.   The story line opens with the chaotic moment of discovery after the historic mass Rapture event, and the remainder is a moral melodrama concluding with emotional born-again conversions.   In the September/October 2006 issue of Foreign Affairs Walt Mead writes that fundamentalists are not hospitable to the idea of gradual progress toward a secular utopia driven by technological advances and the cooperation of intelligent people of all religious traditions.    Instead fundamentalists separate themselves from the world and have a premillennial pessimism about prospects for social reform.  Billy Graham's biography by Strober notes that they criticized Graham's "new evangelism" for its inclusiveness and for its involvement in addressing social problems. Yet their separatism does not preclude proselytizing as portrayed in these novels by the "Tribulation Force" or as exemplified by Jerry Falwell's Moral Majority.  They are also committed to an apocalyptic vision of the end of the world and are hostile to international institutions such as the United Nations. Mead notes that it is no coincidence that the Left Behind novels show the Antichrist rising to power as the secretary-general of the United Nations.  The U.S. Statistical Abstract reports that the per capita numbers of fundamentalists are growing exponentially, while evangelicals and liberals - e.g. Southern Baptists, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Methodists - and Catholics are continuing their per capita declines.  Such data and the reported popularity of these Left Behind novels indicate fundamentalism's growing appeal in reaction to contemporary American society.  I see the readers who seriously respond to this book as the "left behind" in the backwash of the tidal flows of cultural change in modern American society, and as conservative Christians who believe it is better to stay behind.  And in not just a few respects, they may be wise to do so.  Thomas J. Hickey +books
Double Crossed+N+James Patterson created a great character in Alex Cross and I have faithfully followed the series even though the last several have disapponted me.  The plot and character development have become weaker with each book. Yet I kept buying the books, even knowing that Patterson is more of a franchise that an author.   In CROSS Patterson has Alex wonder why his daughter wants to read the same book over and over.  When I read that line I realized that Patterson is making fun of his readers.  That's it for me. I'll not buy another+books
Not one of his best+N+I enjoy the Hillerman Navajo mysteries because the characters are well developed. Not so in this book. I found the first half really boring and hard to get through. The characters were not people you could care about, an important issue for me+books
This Book Made Me Fall Asleep!+N+After reading "Why Do Men Have Nipples" and loving it, I had high hopes for book number two.  I really enjoyed all the chapters in book 1, excluding the dialogue between the authors.  I found it boring and irrelevant to the book itself.  I skipped those sections.  The chapter topics were written humorously but gave factual information. Very fun and interesting!  This book, was boring.  The chapter topics are not nearly as interesting as the first book's.  Once again there is the annoying dialogue (which I skipped).  There was virtually no humor in this book. I felt like the authors scraped the barrel to come up with topics this time around. I was VERY disappointed in this book. I read it in a couple hours. Zzzzz.  Guess these authors are good for just one time+books
Sometimes Witty,  Often Wrong+N+Mark Steyn in Broadway Babies Say Goodnight (Musicals Then and Now) has accomplished an unique objective.  He has written a book that is meant to appeal to people whose veiws are strictly politically conservative, love musicals (particulary fond memories of older musicals that they are in fact too young to have even seen) and do not know any actual facts about the history of the genre so the author's glaring mistakes will not prove an annoyance.  Even stranger is that he has found these people and, God bless them, they have the book they have always dreamed about.  For anyone else, this can be a bit of a slog.  It is funny (espcially if you like puns) in places but the arguments are so often backed up with mistakes as to be worthless.  This book is not truly bad.  It is just simply odd.  If you like Mark Steyn (this book is more about him anyway) then enjoy.  Othewise, it is worth a pass+books
Restated propaganda+N+I can happily say I didn't waste my money on this book, I read a friend's copy.  He has since relinquished this boko to its deserving place, file 13.  It contains nothing new.  nothing relevatory.  It does contain the author's assertions devoid of facts.  the author's opinions disregarding such niceties as what the law says and the historical evidence.  It reads as just another standard regurgitation  of the anti-Israel propaganda that has become so popular.  do yourself a favour and spend your money on something else+books
morally repugnant+N+For 54 years there was no seperation fence or 'apartheid wall' built by Israel to stop the human assaults of suicide bombers.  But this is the cover of this book and points to what is really going on here. The argument is simple, had Zionism not existed there would be no Arab-Israeli conflict.  Had Israel created a Palestinian state, that he Jordanians refused to from 1948-1967, there would have been peace.  The entire onus for any conflict in the middle east rests with Israel.  This is an interesting argument. Israel is unique in being one of the few states created by an ideology, rather than an ideology rising out of a nation(rather Zionism rose out of the Jewish nation, but not in its present borders).  However it is not the only example.  The Risorgimento in Italy is responsible for odern Italy and in a number of other pleace latent ideologies have done the same, creating nations out of loose federations.  After all modern Moldova has little historical merit and neither does Kosovo.  for that matter most of the borders of the Arab states also arise out of modern ideology, especially the borders of modern Turkey.  Only apparently in Israel is this a problem.  The reason is remarkably simple, only in Israel did the creation of the new state result in 50 yeas of warfare.  Other 'old' conflicts like that over Kashmir are likely a result of the same.  But we do not readily argue that the existence of India is responsible for the Kashmir conflict.   It would be hard to imagine the title of an book about another nation being 'the case against ..' for instance 'the case against Germany'.  Therein lis the illogic of this book.  A case cannot be made against the existence of a state.  There can be no 'case against Japan'.    Even if all the arguments are correct, the solution, the disappearence of Israel as a state, is not only genocidal in its intentions but illogical in its premise.  Seth J. Frantzan      +books

Did Anyone Else Notice The Bagavad Gita Connection?+P+Having read the Bagavad Gita, it only much later dawned on me that Carlos is Arjuna and Don Juan is Krishna - only the wisdom is completely different. But in the Gita we have Arjuna who has an ordinary mind and not much bravery at all who yet faces the fact that he has to make a rite of passage which seemingly involves summoning courage to fight an all-inclussive family feud, but becomes something far more spiritualmysticalmetaphysical as he keeps balking at Krisna's encouragement to go through with the pasage. Arjuna keeps telling Krishna he doesn't understand a word Krishna said and Krishna patiently launches into another in-depth explanation - and it is evident that in order for Krishna to fully express the wisdom, spirituality and higher truth of the cosmos, it is necessary for Arjuna to NOT get him and to be continually the baffled coward, hopeless to ever attain gravitational escape velocity, and always planted at square one while Krishna patiently and lovingly imparts the esoteric wonders - like one of those books - "Karma for the Complete Idiot".Castaneda seems to have applied the same schematic - whether knowingly or not - to spoonfeed the Don Juanisms to the reader. And they ARE truly profound - they're too heavy to be something Castaneda just sat at his writing table whipping up out of whole cloth!Castaneda did his research and it's the power of the Don Juan "nuggets" that make the books truly transcendent and generous in their magic - which is contagious to a reader! That said, however, I got the feeling that Castaneda was, by the 4th or 5th volume, really starting to spin his wheels and using more effort than content to take us to the next level. Castaneda has done a great service in giving humanity some cracks to fall through in our supposed finite  and material trappings. And so has the Bagavad Gita+books
MISREPRESENTATION: This is 1892 Deathbed Edition!+N+Although the poems are beautiful... and I certainly don't mean to bash Whitman with this 2-star rating... it's the wrong book. NOT AS ADVERTISED. This was supposed to be the original 1855 edition. That's what I expected, and therefore (in my mind) what I was paying for. The original 1855 edition, according to modern literary analysis, was the "strongest/purest" version. It was the true starting point of Whitman's own (and consequently America's) poetic awakening. Consisting of just 12 "perfect" poems, it was THAT edition which Emerson praised so highly.  Whitman never put out another book... just revision after revision, addition after addition, and edition after edition of Leaves Of Grass... until you wind up with "the deathbed edition" which is a severely bloated and different work from the original.   I was very much looking forward to a slender volume of the original edition. Which is what the item description says this is. It's not. Be forewarned... it's the Deathbed Edition of 1892... nearly 500 pages. And frankly, there are MUCH better versions of the deathbed edition. Sturdier versions with nicer pages exist (this is a pretty weak paperback, printed on pulp pages), with better footnotes and more authoritive introductions. Shop around.   To sum up... the 2 star rating is because lying about which edition this is, is a terrible way to sell the book. Whitman was fantastic and the poetry contained in the book itself is first rate. It just would have been nice to get what I paid for. The "true" editon, written by a YOUNG Whitman at the height of his powers..+books
The Cottage+P+This is one of Danielle Steel's best books. It is about Cooper Winslow, a fading movie actor and lady's man who is in financial trouble. She develops the character of "Coop" well so it is easy to visualize him.   Coop decides to rent out his "cottage" guest wings for $10,000 a month to two different tenants. The story centers around his new tenants, their romances, activities and children. In the end, Coop learns valuable lessons about sacrifice, giving to others and true love.   A interesting story with a good message+books
Read Clayton Christensen's Books Instead+N+This book covers much of the same ground that Clayton Christensen explored in his three revolutionary books: The Innovator's Dilemma, The Innovator's Solution, and Seeing What's Next. Truthfully, those books do a far superior job of explaining the dynamics of innovation in comparison to the performance of this book. Utterback does have very insightful comments on the standardization of product design, but outside of that section, the book is not particularly exemplary. For those interested in mastering the art of innovation, the game begins and ends with Clayton Christensen+books

Yes, Stephen King really IS that good+P+There was a time when Stephen King was one of my favorite authors. Then I started hanging out with a better class of authors, hehe. But now, he is once again one of my favorite authors. As I said before, he's raised his game. ON WRITING and everything after. If it's a re-issue of an oldie, well, it has a new introduction by the guy who wrote ON WRITING, and that alone makes it worth buying again. Truly, I love every word he's published for the past five years. The guy was already (perhaps) the best seller of all time, and he wasn't satisfied. How great is that?   What we have here is a collection of 14 short stories, some just creepy/scary and others literary. It's a wonderful mix of what we've always known he excels at and what we may not have realized he excels at. Several months back, I heard some scary rumors to the effect that he might retire. That is not allowed. Stephen, if you retire, I'm gonna round up Annie Wilkes and we're gonna make you shave Picasso's neck. So there! +books
Not as frenetic as Dirk Pitt, but a nice diversion...+P+Kurt Austin is back in the latest installment by Clive Cussler and Paul Kemprecos...  Polar Shift.  It's a nice "mind candy" bit of diversion...  Austin and the NUMA crew are once again pulled into breaking up a plot that threatens to destroy the earth.  A group of anarchists (well-funded ones) have discovered a way to force a polar shift of the magnetic north and south pole.  By doing so, they hope to destroy the world's navigation and communication infrastructure, allowing their heavily shielded replacements to survive as the only game in town.  The only thing that can stop them is a young woman who is the granddaughter of the original scientist who learned about the shift decades.  She doesn't know that she holds the key to reversing the polarity, but NUMA and Austin have to find her before the others get there first...  I didn't expect blockbuster material here, just a fun read.  And basically that's what I got.  The Austin series isn't quite as frenetic a pace as the Dirk Pitt series, nor is the dialog between Austin and his sidekick quite as entertaining.  Still, it was a book I enjoyed picking up each evening before I went to bed.  I'm not sure I would have wanted to pay $27 for it, but as a library book it was fine+books
Stay Back+N+Reading this book was exhausting, confusing, and extremely unsatisfying. Sentences and parqagraphs ramble arround with confusing descriptions and conflicting information. Some major elements that are introduced are left hanging; never brought up again. Others are revisited ad nauseum. Barr's quirky way of describing people and places with bizarre comparisons slows down the plot and is just missleading. Although I did stay with it until the contrived end, this is the first book I ever attacked with a red pen and edited a I went along. I estimate it could have been 50 pages shorter, and have carried far more impact, without the extraneous language. I am shocked she sells well enough to have published so many books. I'd stay far away from her in the future and purify yourself by reading a clasic P.D. James or a pure and simple Sue Grafton+books
Your kids need this book!+P+This book shows children that one person can make a positive impact on the world, and that God is with them even during the bad times of their lives. It was Squanto's faith in God that helped him forgive Europeans for  kidnapping him, and it was his faith in God that made him decide to help  the Pilgrims. The spiritual aspect of Squanto's life is too important to  leave out when we pass this story down to our children+books
misleading title+N+Despite what the book title "Grammatically Correct", this book is mostly about punctuation usages.  Grammar is limited to a thin, single chapter.  There are not sufficient materials on grammar to alert you on incorrect usages, let alone correct them.  I would recommend "Painless Grammar" over this title+books
poorly organized, defensively written+N+I bought this book based on the number of favorable reviews and was disappointed. Poehlmann's tone is defensive, and the book offers more rhetoric than useful information. This is a fine book for those who are already convinced of the mycoplasma theory and the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy, but it for those who are seeking more information, it falls flat, chiefly because it fails to offer a cogent, rational uninflected basis for its views+books
Amazing+P+This is a great book.  It is written for the common person that may not be all too interested in history.  I could hardly put it down.  After having to read hundreds of tedious history books for my degree, it was nice to read something with a bit of emotion.  While he cannot be 100% accurate all the time it is still very good for people who want a swift read about WWII soldiers+books
Terrible Mis-Representation of the Baha'i Faith+N+This book has several mentions of the Baha'i Faith in it, referring to the Faith as &quot;an offshoot of Islam&quot;, and in one part quoting someone as making the Baha'is out to look like violent animals. I will never read anything by this author again, she may be aware of Iran's history and politics, but is very miseducated in the area of the Baha'i Faith (not Bahaism as she writes it). The Baha'is are quite the opposite of what this author believes+books
Great Book, but be aware of what it isn't+P+This is a great book, and well worth purchasing if you want to learn about finances for investment properties.  It is not all that it could be, but don't let that stop you from using it to get started.  All that having been said, here are the things that I had to be careful about:  1) Ten performance measurements and ratios are presented in chapter 6, and they represent the heart of the book.  There is little overview of which ones are most importance or how to use or weigh conflicting or offsetting results.  2) The book is heavily centered on spreadsheets, which the author offers to sell to you.  Others have criticized the spreadsheets for being locked.  I used the book to recreate my own version of the spreadsheets, and the extensive explanations in the book helped, mostly, to make sure that I got the underlying formulas correct.  What I noticed, however, is that the book sorely needed a financially sophisticated editor.  For example, the spreadsheet on page 193 has an entry for "Expense/Foot."  In fact, this entry is none other than the OER - Operating Expense Ratio - that was developed in Chapter 6.  Why go to all the trouble to create and define ratios, if you aren't then going to use them.  Other parts of the spreadsheets were equally problematic.  For example, the Net CF's - presumably "cash flow" - for a 3 year exit only had the receipts for years 1 and 2, and not for year 3.  Lastly, the book has nothing to say about (a) maintaining and growing a real estate portfolio of multiple properties as opposed to a single property, or (b) evaluating the relatively new 1031 multiple tenants in common investments that some long time owners are trading into in order to stop being a full time property manager as well as an investor.+books
Every Bit as Good as Elegant Universe+P+I would respectfully disagree with those who suggest that "Fabric of the Cosmos" is just a rehash of "Elegant Universe" with little more to offer, and in fact not as well written.  On the contrary, I found "Fabric of the Cosmos" to be equally as engaging as "Elegant Universe" and to offer a great deal of new material.  It is true that some of the background material on relativity and quantum mechanics is covered in both books, but I for one preferred it that way.  I read "Elegant Universe" several years ago, and although I have a general feel for the concepts, I appreciated the refresher on many of the details.  By including the background material in "Fabric of the Cosmos" I never felt lost, and I never had to refer back to another book.  The background material on relativity and quantum mechanics is similar in both books, but it is not identical, so I never felt like I was rereading the same old stuff.  Another minor issue I've seen some complain about is the use of The Simpson's (and other) television characters in his examples.  Personally I could care less what characters are used in the examples, but from a practical standpoint, I much preferred names like Marge and Lisa to names like Slim and Jim (which were used in "Elegant Universe").  I could easily keep track of what Marge and Lisa were doing in an example, whereas I was often confused about what Slim and Jim were doing.  The similar sounding names drove me crazy.  So from a practical standpoint, I preferred the names used in "Fabric of the Cosmos".  Now what about the content of the two books?  For me "Elegant Universe" was more of an introduction to string theory, whereas  "Fabric of the Cosmos" was much more an exposition on cosmology.  In "Elegant Universe" roughly the first 130 pages gave a background on relativity and quantum mechanics, and then the remainder of the book, some 250 pages, was about string theory.  In "Fabric of the Cosmos" roughly the same space is devoted to background info on relativity and quantum mechanics, (about 120 pages) but with more of a cosmological slant related to questions of "what is space" and "what is time".  Then roughly the next 200 pages give an outstanding description of where we're at in terms of cosmological theories about the origin of the universe.  If you want an excellent description of inflation theory, Higgs fields, and the like, this is the source.  And then only in the last roughly 120 pages does Greene bring string theory into all of this, and then with the same overarching cosmological slant which is a common thread running through the book.  Bottom line is "Fabric of the Cosmos" provided me with a terrific overview of cosmology that I did not get from "Elegant Universe".  Both books are outstanding, and I would certainly recommend both.  The point being simply that these are different books, and "Fabric of the Cosmos" is not just a rehash of "Elegant Universe".  Finally, as in "Elegant Universe", Greene takes the reader very logically from one step to the next.  I've read many books that make broad statements about how one thing relates to another with zero explanation of how that relationship was derived.  In Greene's book this is never an issue.  Sometimes this can make the writing a bit long and dense, but I would much prefer a book that I can logically work my way through, albeit sometimes with a bit of patience, than a book with logical gaps that no amount of patience is going to resolve.  Don't get me wrong though, even though the book can sometimes be a bit dense, I never found it to be dry.  Greene does a great job of making the book engaging and enjoyable to read throughout.  Very highly recommended+books
The Meaning of Joie-de-Vivre+P+So that's what Joie-de-Vivre means. It's really not the point whether the anecdotes are based on real facts. It's D.V.'s attitude, her curiosity, her passion for certain things, and her irreverence for the rest is what's most inspiring. The writing, edited by George Plimpton and Christopher Hemphill, is wonderfully imaginative and poetic, be it about Mona Lisa or Buffalo Bill. I recommend it to anyone with an eye for details and a passion for life+books
Exchanges are the foundation of weight and blood sugar managment.+P+There is nothing more basic for weight and blood sugar management than the food exchanges. They are called exchanges because the foods in each group can be exchanged with each other and still supply a similar amount of calories, proteins, carbohydrates, fats and other nutrients. "The Official Pocket Guide to Dieabetic Exchanges" is an excellent resource for  describing the nature and benefits of the exchanges.  I have been a diabetic since the age of 50. It is certainly easier to use the exchange system then laboriously counting calories and carbohydrates. They give us a short hand method of coming up with close approximations.   One thing that can also be of benefit to diabetics is the glycemic index which measures the impact of various carbohydrates on our blood sugar level. Glucose is given a value of 100. All other foods are ranked according to the percentage rise they cause as compared to glucose. For example, apple juice has a glycemic index of 40. This means that a serving of apple juice containing 25 grams of carbohydrates would cause a blood sugar rise that is 40 percent of that which would be caused by 25 grams of pure glucose.  Related to the glycemic index is the glycemic load which applied the glycemic index to serving sizes. To calculate the glycemic load the grams of carbohydrates (less the fiber) is multiplied by the glycemic index expressed as a percentage. An exchange of apple juice has 15 grams of carbohydrates. Multiplying this by 40% (glycemic index of 40) yields a glycemic load of 6. Now lets compare this to 15 gm of watermelon. Watermelon has a glycemic index of 72 which is higher than table sugar. The glycemic load of watermelon is 11 (15 x .72 = 11). Thus the impact of watermelon on our blood sugar is almost twice for the same level of carbohydrates. Fortunately, a half of watermelon only has six grams of carbohydrates as compared to a half cup of apple juice which has 14. Measured on a volume basis the apple juice actually has a higher glycemic impact. No such luck with a baked potato which has a glycemic index of 85. A half cup of baked potatoes has 38 grams of carbohydrate. This yields a glycemic load of 32 (38 X .95 = 32).  Determining the glycemic impact of foods does require more effort than just counting exchanges. But by getting involved in the details I have been able to lose nearly 80 pounds and am able to manage my blood sugar levels with diet and exercise. This has certainly been a worthwhile effort for me.  I am sure that it would be for others.  Good Eating+books
Page Turner and Thought Provoking, N.King, CA+P+The author has a unique way of keeping you captivated and he will renew your thoughts about wolves. This book was recommended, it was not something I would have read, but after reading it I could hardly put it down, I found myself clued to this book, very funny and touching at the same time. This by far was the most revealing book about wild animals I have ever read. You will not regret reading this book; I bought 3 others after reading it.  +books
Nietzsche DESTROYS Christian dogma with this book+P+Nietzsche is a genius. His ideas are still as important today as they were the day he wrote them. He destroys Christianity in one fell swoop - anyone who reads the Will to Power and still believes in Christian dogma is in the purest state of denial. Nietzsche provides saying after saying after saying, perfect for debate. If you're a doubter or secular, read this book and you will erase all possibilities of the Bible being real from your mind forever+books
Author devoid of the Holy Spirit, and ignorant of Holy Scriptures+N+Author displays his ignorance of the Holy Scriptures through out his book. Let me just highlight three areas.  (1) He quotes 1 Timothy 2:9-15 and then makes the following blasphemous statement,  " Furthermore, they (woman) are held responsible for the origin of sin in the world: It was the woman who was deceived, not the man. " How spiritually blind one can get?   Let me elaborate. Apostle Paul in his letter to the church at Rome writes:  Romans 5:12 "Just as sin entered into the world by one man, and death by means of sin, so death was imposed upon all men, in asmuch as they all have sinned."  Holy Spirit is holding Adam responsible for the entry of sin into the world. Yes Eve was deceived first by that serpent of old, called the Devil. Adam was not deceived, but disobeyed deliberately. Adam was the door through whom sin entered the world. Sin was the door through which death entered the world. I strongly feel that the words spoken by my Savior, Lord Eshoo Messiah (Aramaic for Jesus Christ) to Nichodemus in John 3:10 are applicable to Marcus Borg also.  John 3:10  Eshoo answered, You are a teacher of Israel, and yet you do not undertsnad these things.?  (2) Author writes:  " I see the Bible as human response to God. Rather than seeing God as Scriptures's ultimate author.... the Bible thus tells us about how they saw things, not about how God sees things." This is blasphemy.   Holy Scriptures consisting of (Law of Moshey, Prophets, Psalms, four Gospels, Book of the Acts of the Apostles, 14 Epistles of Apostle Paul, one Epistle of James, two Epistles of Peters, three Epistles of John, one Epistle of Jude, and the Lord Eshoo Messiah's revelation to John) are Living WORD of God spoken by His prophets and Apostles through the Holy Spirit sent from heaven. If God had not revealed Himself, we will still be speculating because we are fallen and fallible creatures. I thank the Lord that He took initiative and revealed Himself.  Apostle Peter writes:   "We have also a TRUE WORD of prophesy; you do well when you look to it for guidance, as you look to the lamp that shines in a dark place until the dawn of day, when the sun will shine in your hearts."  God with wisdom created the heaven and earth in the very beginning. Book of Proverbs was written so that we may know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding; to receive discipline, reverence, righteousness, and justice, and equity.It says the following about God's word:  Proverbs 8:8-9  "All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is nothing perverse or deceptive in them. They are all plain to him who understands them, and right to those who are willing to find knowledge."  Author ignored the words of the Holy Spirit spoken through King Solomon, Son of David, wherein he writes:   "If you will turn to my reproof, behold, I will pour out My Spirit upon you; I will make known My words to you(Proverbs 1:23.)"   In my view, author of the book while thinking within himself that he is wise, he became fool (Romans 1:22.).   (3)Let me illustrate author's foolishness with another blasphemy. He writes:   " But a moment's reflection suggests that the Ten Commandments are also a human product and written from a male point of view.". I wonder if he has ever studied the book of Pslams. Let me just quote Psalm 19 where law is called Law of the LORD.  Psalm 19:7-11  "The Law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul; the testimony of the LORD is trustworthy, making wise the young men. The statues of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes. The reverence of the LORD is clean, enduring forever; the judgment of the LORD are true and righteous altogether. They are more to be coveted than gold; yea, than precious stones; sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb. Moreover by them Thy servant is warned; and if he keep them he shall be greatly rewarded."  Book of Revelation says that:  "This is the perseverence of saints that they keep the commandment of God and their testimony of Eshoo Messiah, who is King of kings, LORD of lords."  Apostle Peter 2000 years ago had warned us of such self appointed professors when he writes:  2 Peter 3:16 "..... In Paul's epistles there are certain things so hard to be understood that those who are ignorant and unstable pervert their meanings, as they do also the other Scriptures, to their own destruction".  Holy Spirit calls such authors as "springs without water, cloud that are carried away with a tempest; the mist of darkness is reserved for them forever.....". "Verily it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment that was delivered to them."  Author's contempt for the Holy Scriptures can be traced to his upbringing in the Lutheran church. He says: "I was nurtured in the the Lutheran church and remained Lutheran until about age 30."  Luther is not much of a roll model for anything. It is Luther who showed contempt for the Holy Scriptures when he called book of James, " an epistle of straw". Luther called book of Revelation, "worthless". Talk about having an arrogant and audacious attitude. Lord Eshoo Messiah said "unless we become like little children we can not enter the kingdom of God". By that, my Savior did not mean at all that we should be childish. What he talks about is having child like trust.   Book of Psalms tells that "He teaches humble His way".   And "fear of God is the beginning of wisdom but fool despise wisdom and instruction."   To such self appointed reformers and professors, Holy Spirit had issued following warning in the Epistle of James:  James 3:1 "Let not many of you become teachers,my brethren, knowing that as such we will incur a stricter judgment."  Luther should have kept himself busy studying God's word instead of writing the anti-jewish tripe, " Jews and their lies". This book came in very handy for Hitler who sent 6 millions of the seed of Abraham( Jews) to their death in holocaust - pan European event. 6th commandment, which is Law of God says: "Thou shall not kill or murder"   Holy Scriptures says that like cloud and wind without rain is man who boast of his gift falsely. Neither Luther nor the author possess the gift of teaching. I am convinced that there was no reformation. Things have not changed at all. In Rome we have one Pope on seven hills. Protestant movement has produced seven popes on every dunghill(western and eastern churches).  Lord Eshoo during His earthly ministry did not speak of reformations or revivals, but instead said:  " Because of the growh of iniquity (lawlessness) love of many will grow cold. Will Son of Man find faith when He returns?"  I want to cry out: Help Lord, godly men ceases to be, and faith has disappeared from the earth"  Let me end my review with the following words of encouragement as well as warning given by the Holy Spirit:  Proverbs 30: 5-6  "Every word of God is pure; He is a shiled to those who put their trust in Him. Do not add to His words; lest He reprove you, and you be found a liar."  He who has ears, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.

Should Have Been a 20-Page Undergraduate Paper +N+I bought this book based on its 5-star rating and feel I wasted my money.  That's how I REALLY feel, authentically.  I have read other works positing a connection between physical symptoms/illnesses and life trauma; the idea is not unique or new. Alice Miller is fixated on the idea that the Fouth Commandment (honor thy parents) has poisoned lives and ruined society and restates this theory every page or two.  This notion is so compelling to her that she actually went to the Vatican to complain.  Ms. Miller gives anecdotal information about famous people who died young and then leaps to the conclusion that their parents were mean to them. Maybe they were -- but what are we supposed to do with this information? Find a therapist who is willing to become emotionally involved with us seems to be the cure.  This medicine carries its own risks.  I'm sorry Alice was also raised by abusers (which she confesses) but getting tangled up in some codependent parent-figure therapeutic emotional incest with her or someone like her is not really going to help anybody. Realizing what happened to you is important, and raging and grieving about it is important, but sooner or later you have to move on.  Forgiving isn't forgetting or letting the abuser off the hook -- it's letting YOU off the hook, refusing to be owned by the past anymore.  And yes, you can love and hate somebody at the same time.   It gets down to knowing you can't get what you needed from them or any other person in your adult life...YOU have to become the parent of the wounded child within and HELP THAT CHILD FINISH GROWING UP.  Good luck and God bless...if you're needing a book like this for yourself.       +books
Obviously, not his best+N+This novel won the Pulitzer Prize in 1926 (for whatever reason) which the author refused to accept (maybe he agreed with some of the reviews).  The author later won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1930.  The novel is about a fictional person growing up in a fictional state, going to a fictional university, etc.  I may get jumped on by some people for saying so, but personally I found the story dull and tedious (a good cure for insomnia).  It does not compare with other prize winning novels which I have read that were written during the same era (Pearl Buck's "The Good Earth," Booth Tarkington's "The Magnificent Ambersons," etc.).  I suppose this is one of those novels that you must read if you are a literature student, but I would not recommend it to anyone else.  If you have an interest in the author, I would suggest trying one of his other novels+books
A guide that makes orgasm simple.+P+This is a great guide that every woman should own. It not only tells and explains how to have orgasms, but also tells you about how to enhance them. I liked the author's honest, straight-forward approach. The details were too detailed or mundane, either, which made it a quick, easy read. Definitely recommended to all women, along with "Good Sex, a woman's guide" and "Supersex"+books
When a High Initiate in ECK  becomes twisted by the Dark Side +N+What so many past and even some current chelas overlook is that there is a difference between Sri Harold Klemp, the man, and the ECK which uses and continues to use him as ITS divine channel in all the worlds of God.   Recently I took the fourth initiation in ECKANKAR. Yesterday, while in contemplation I sang my new secret word with my attention on the  current Living ECK Master and experienced the Light of God.   Ford Johnson's assertion that chelas are prevented from becoming Masters is a falsehood. Before Millie Moore translated she had reached the Ninth Initiation, the point at which ECK Mastership commences.   It's sad to see a former High Initiate like Ford Johnson who has become 'twisted by the Dark Side'+books
not good....except for jim lee+N+right lets make this very clear there are only 3 good issues out of the nine here...the actual x men issues with art by jim lee and scott williams are essential...claremonts words and lees pencils have always been a good combo...the fight scenes are dramatic and exciting and everythings...well...everythings just right  however  the other 6 coming from new mutants and x factor are crap...the arts rubbish and especially by the last 2 chapters you just want it to end...seriously it just drags on...they lose their powers get em back...still they get beat down. dont know about you but i dont particularly enjoy watching the x men lose fight after fight after fight (which they seemed to do a lot of in the late 80s early 90s) unfortuantely its quite an essential story as it brings all the x men back together after a few years apart  buy it for jim lee and try to stomach the other stories +books
Surprisingly Good!+P+James Patterson's work over a decade ago stopped consistently being masterpiece after masterpiece and became very hit and miss with very average novels published throughout most of his recent career, with only the odd great read every now and then published, with readers just keep picking up each successive novel hoping the old quality will be back.  Well I'm pleased to say, it is back with The Angel Experiment.  I must admit I was very surprised as Patterson's last attempt at the children's market SantaKid, well as those of us unfortunate enough to have read it know, pitiful is being nice.  With Maximum Ride The Angel Experiment, quality is achieved albeit for a much older children's market than SantaKid.  Well actually I don't even know why the publishers say this is a kids book (young adult) as it is even more violent than the two adult novels in this series and although it has been a while since I read When the Wind Blows and The Lake House I didn't really notice any differences in the way they are written.   Obviously it's just a marketing thing by the publishers to sell more books in this series.  Although you could read this as a stand alone novel you really do need to have previously read the two adult novels before this as well to understand and enjoy this story to its full extent, so marketing this and the subsequent novels in this series as a younger age group doesn't make much sense but adults will love this book anyway.   In Maximum Ride the Angel Experiment, Max and the five other kids with wings are back for the third instalment in the series.  They are happily living in their secluded hide out which Jed, the good scientist from the School who unfortunately met his demise in the previous books set up for them.  Their peaceful existence is smashed however when the youngest girl Angel is taken by Erasers (bad creations from the school).  Max takes control and organises a rescue mission where the children all discover they have other powers they haven not tapped into yet. The mission will take them not only to the rural school but to New York and the answers to their past they so have longed for all their lives.  Some unpleasant surprises are on the way for Max and the others that will repulse them beyond any level they've endured before!+books

Disappointed+N+Nothing new in this book and CD does not add to the value of this purchase. I purchased the book and CD combination in hopes of having experiential exercises. Exercises are provided, yet the author merely explains these on the CD versus guiding one through a meditation. It feels as if he is merely reading the directions for the exercises and the exercises are not new or imaginative. If one is new to self help books on healing trauma or anxiety, this may be the book for you. I've read and heard authors and psychologists talk about the flight and fight response over 20 years ago. I, personally, have found more healing/success in spiritual books, guided meditations or intense physical exercise where my heart rate increases or in strength training. +books
Disappointing !!+N+I found this book a truly disapointment !! When i started the book , the story of Abby and Lucian was so intense , so passionate that i thought i was going to love it . Then the book advances to this days with the story of Declan and Lena , and it was ugelly disapointing !! They don't have anything in commun with Abby and Lucian !! Lena and Declan , they don't work as a couple in love ; to me they was no chemestry or anything between them . I only read the book till the end because i wanted to know how it was going to end with Abby and Lucian , but that too was a little beyond what i thought it was going to be , they deserv a better ending , i don't now how but that was not what i expected !+books
Absolutely Incredible Book for A Believer+P+I can't exactly say how a non-believer would take this book, there is that guy who wrote something about evilution producing this or that, but other than that I'll have to read the other reviews. Anyway the beauty of this book is in how well it illustrates the extreme extent to which God goes to in order to bring us to Salvation, while still holding the very fabric of life amidst consciousness and all of it's beauty and glory in careful suspension. I believe this is the notion of His love that Lewis is focused on. As a last resort method of God communicating with us, pain plays a - well - painful role, to which I'm no stranger. Still I'll bet that when we get to heaven God will truthfully say, it hurt me far, far more than it hurt you. Amen.+books
Excellent Biography+P+This is a spectacular read, well balanced in all aspects of JFK's life from cradle to grave.  Although rather long, the pages flow nicely.  The author takes the middle road, and sees JFK as a great leader in many situations, but not perfect nor a saint.  This produces a well-rounded and complete biography.  New information on JFK's health is sprinkled throughout.  As a caveat, this book is about JFK's LIFE, not his DEATH.  Less than ten pages of over 700 are involving the assassination.  So regardless of what you think or feel about November of 1963, if you want a book focused on that, find a different book instead of leaving negative reviews+books
The Civil WAR+P+Mr Foote has written about the "War Between the States".  He tells the story of the WAR.  It is not the story of slavery or its demise, not about the country's explosive economic growth that ensued, not about a lot of other subjects, just about the WAR and the men who led it and fought it.  If you want to experience the ghastlyness that millions of Americans did in 1862 to 1865, read these books.  No one has done this better. +books
... a different kind of book ...+P+... This is a very good read ... this book offers much more than the usual approach of `tell the dog to sit, and reward it with a treat' ... the author approaches the problem of bad dog behaviour from the owner's perspective, as well as from the dog's perspective ... a holistic approach that avoids harsh punishment ... The author tells us that in order to correct a dog, oftentimes we must first as owners correct ourselves, our approach ... our whole attitude ... we are encouraged to try and learn the nature of dogs, their instincts and propensities ... the numerous case studies are also extremely useful ... All in all, a very good book, informative, sensible and effective+books
An Amazing Life Story+P+This book is a wonderfully informative and touching story of a great and honorable man.  Through Totch we learn of a nearly forgotten way of life and we see the Everglades as it used to be.  I appreciate his honesty and plainspokeness and I'm thankful Totch made this book to preserve an important history.  I also recommend the three movies made about him: Totch Brown's tales of the Everglades and 10,000 islands, The Everglades outlaw Totch Brown, and Yesterday's Everglades+books

Excellent source from 13 years ago+P+When a pair of writers with special skills in the social science of espionage put their heads together, you can hear the resulting &quot;click&quot; in the pages of this very special book. Espionage, after all, is the art of the possible. A knows something and B wants to find out A) what A knows and B) how he knows what it is. It's a simple, elegant geometry, and Shulsky knows it better than LeCarre. I came to this text hoping to find out more about the world of intelligence. I figured, there's got to be more to it than the cartoonish figure than Kiefer Sutherland plays on TV's 24, surrounded by his loyal staff Tony and Michelle.    And there's got to be more going on but if so, how did the USA land in such an awful dilemma as to depend on its intelligence committees which suggested that, for example, there are WMD's in Iraq when as it turns out, if there ever were any, there don't seem to be any now. As Shulsky points out, there's almost no blame-sharing protocol within intelligence agencies. It's as if God made them and then forgot to teach them the words, &quot;I'm sorry.&quot; This is the one book in which you can learn why this should be so. Intelligence has changed rapidly in the years since the Cold War ended, and there are some satisfying books you could follow up on for post-graduate work, but SILENT WARFARE is a savvy place to begin+books
Very Pretty - Not So Helpful+N+Sigh...  Like most of Andrew Lloyd Webber's sheet music, selections from Phantom of the Opera gives you a watered-down transcription featuring many cuts.  Even worse, the accompaniment is hardly the original accompaniment at all, rather it simply follows the vocal line.  This might be acceptable for fans who simply want to play through the music on their parlor piano without a vocalist, but for a real musical theater fan, it's very disappointing.  So far, I've only found one place which gives an accurate transciption of the accompaniment (an excerpt from the full piano-vocal score).  The Singer's Musical Theatre Anthology: Soprano, Vol. 3, compiled by Richard Walters features "Think of Me" and "Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again" in their original form.  For performers and accompanists alike, there's something to get excited about.  So far, we're still waiting on more from the Phantom of the Opera, but they're creating a 4th edition of the Anthologies soon, so watch out+books
Tedious, Voluminous, Intense +P+Having chewed and digested "Around the World in Eighty Days", "Five Weeks in a Balloon" and "Journey to the Centre of the Earth", I set out to devour another chef d'oeuvre of Verne [the often overlooked "true" father of science fiction] with much relish. Sure, "20,000 Leagues" seemed bigger than the others I'd read, but I thought it would be the classic excitement and drama of Verne all the way. Well, I was nearly right.  Professor Arronax leaves a "normal" life in France for the US, taking his assistant with him, to investigate the matter that has taken all the attention of the "modern" or "known" world. Joined by the egotistic harpooner, Ned Land, they seek adventure, and they find it.  Again, I see Verne's classic touch of the dramatic as the threesome find the monster - the Nautilus - or rather, as the Nautilus finds them. They awaken to an interminable adventure under the sea. The Professor is fascinated, or perhaps, intoxicated with the endless wealth of life in the sea and spends hours, days and months observing and recording. The tireless taxonomist takes in all the eye can see and with the help of his assistant, classifies it all. This is where the tedium began for me as the reader. Pages upon pages of pure taxonomy.   The accounts of the undersea explorations in specially designed suits offers some relief. The enigmatic Captain Nemo is in charge; incidents and never accidents. Everything about him is shrouded in mystery - pondering on the life of Captain Nemo offers some useful distraction and provides the fuel to consume more and more pages.  However, you can never miss Verne's climactic scenes, where he brings drama and suspense to their peak. The almighty Nautilus is trapped inside a huge mass of ice at the South Pole, and for the first time, Captain Nemo shows signs of worry, however subtle. Yet, he goes on with a steely determination. Things are looking very desperate, but as usual, the day is saved. However, I found myself following every detail, sharing all their fears, their toil, their despair. Their ecstasy was mine when the Nautilus broke free. I was totally drawn in...  ...The irritable Ned Land sparks the fire of escape. He's sick and tired of submarine life as Nemo shows no signs of releasing his charges. The adventure ends with the escape of the threesome back to terra firma, or does it? I guess it continued with Captain Nemo and his longsuffering crew until his death, burying years of useful knowledge and resources under the sea. Or did he live forever?  A highly challenging but rewarding read for the discerning reader or Verne fanatic+books
Should be required for all law students+P+I am a law student who read this edition of Blackstone's Commentaries for a jurisprudence course, and it was a great experience.  Blackstone details the inner logic and principles of the common law and why it stands as an equal among Greek, Roman, and civil law.  He also systematically details the logic and basis for the law of civil rights, property, civil procedure, and criminal law in England.  These sections provided me with a much better understanding of the origin and rationality behind our system of law.  In addition he also explains the historical origins of the common law and the political structure of England's government at the time just before our nation's independence and why it had been superior, at that time, to any other form of government in all of Europe in the securing and preservation of human liberty.  I highly recommend at least volume I to law students and even to any reader interested in better understanding the origins of our government.  His explanations in particular will give you a much better understanding of how English government functioned and how our government distinguished itself in substantial ways from England.  Any scholar, student, or avid reader of political science, law, or history will benefit and enjoy this great literary work.  Ignore the earlier critique of the font, the facsimile of the first edition really transports you back in time and the font is not that difficult to navigate.  The only real difference is "f" is used in place of "s" everywhere but in the last letter of words ("greateft" "fortrefs" "fubject" etc.).  Generally it's very clear when the "f" is an "s" although there are a few confusing exceptions (e.g. "wife" is "wise" as in the "wife laws of England...").  The first edition included footnotes where Blackstone cited English, Latin, and Roman works and these are reproduced here as well. +books
Red Storm Never Gets Off The Ground+N+I'll repeat what surprisingly only a few people have mentioned so far. Unless you're an expert in military lingo and with the different types of military hardware you're going to find yourself lost and disinterested.    The first few chapters were actually quite good and laid the groundwork for what I thought would be a good story.  The remaining chapters had little connection to this however.  The book ended up being nothing more than endless military talk, little character development, tedious descriptions of military and submarine encounters.  Even Clancy's much maligned Red Rabbit is far superior to this+books
This man is a visionary and a genius+P+If only Washington could embrace the ideas laid out in this book. I think Newt would make a fresh and bright addition to the McCain administration.  Perhaps even VP. Newt does have everything one needs to be the president, however not in 2008.  The conditions disallow the risk of running anything but a sure thing to stave off the potential nightmare that both Hillary or Al Gore represent. But Newt's knowledge and wisdom will flow freely throughout the coming political process and his message will be heard. Bravo+books
Not one of Stuart Woods best work+N+I usually enjoy his books, even though they are formulaic, but this one was so thin in plot it was sad.  It was obvious from the get go who the bad guys were.  Of course there was the usual requisite sex scenes, even these were thin.  The dialogues were stilted. There was no character building if per chance you hadn't read his other books.  I agree with the reviewer who said this must have been a churn book.  I don't usually write reviews, but felt compelled to comment on this boo+books

One Case Where the Film was Probably Better+N+This is a product of the lazy, latter-day Leonard who knows he's a great writer who can just sit back and let it flow. The onetime master of concision now takes a hundred-odd pages just to set things up.  Even his ear for dialogue has started to fade on him. Now everybody like, y'know, talks like, uhh, some kinda boob, get what I'm sayin'? The line of self-parody is lying a little too close in these pages.  He still has a hand with the quirky minor characters, though they can't carry an entire 350-page plus novel. But this one did make it clear to me why Leonard is so popular with the pomo crowd: his characters inhabit an utterly amoral universe, one with no values or standards whatsoever. Here, e.g., the protagonist is that well-known figure drawn from life, the friendly, easygoing loan shark. In your traditional crime novel--Chandler or either MacDonald can serve as examples--the action occurs against a hard-edged moral framework that is at least given lip service. Now I won't demand that every piece of fiction act as a morality play. But this was a case where I finished the thing, and kind of enjoyed the ride, but didn't like myself for it. In Leonard's recent novels, all that matters is who gets to take home the candy. And when you get right down to it, that just ain't enough.+books
A Derridean Orientalism+P+Mitchell's writing, as stated in the reviews, takes the scholarship begun by Heidegger and continued by Derrida and Foucault and applies it to his critique of 19th century colonialism.  The ideas of deconstruction and its fight to overturn both complete objectivity and the hope of &quot;overcoming the system&quot; lead Mitchell to demonstrate that the West and its objectivity is rooted in as much subjectivity as any other cultural perspective.  It is this Western rationale that brought European colonialists to impose their values and hierarchies onto the Oriental system, bringing the power structures of Foucault's discourses to the fore.  Whatever conclusion you come to take from the book, and Mitchell's arguments are exceptionally convincing, you will certainly not leave its pages with the same mindset you entered+books
Political correctness gone amok.+N+If your teaching a class on feminist political correctness this is the book for you.  This book provides lots of racial, ethnic, geographic and sexual identity diversity, but its pretty thin on the great book part.  The  overwhelming majority of the 500 books are from the 20th Century and yet  there is not one reference to Gina Berriault that I could find.  Perhaps  her political credentials were not good enough; all she can do is write  great fiction.  If you really want to read a great book written by a woman,  then read The Lights of Earth, or Women in Their Beds by Gina Berriault+books
For serious reader+P+Fromm is one of the classics - along with Freud, Jung, Adler. He studied psychology, philosophy and sociology, received his PhD at the age of 22, became interested in Zen Buddhism at the age of 26. One of the true geniuses. This book was written in 1956. Here Fromm discusses love from philosophical, psychological and sociological point of view. What love is and isn't? In what ways do we misconceive love? Is love indeed an art? Why do we need it? What is the difference between love of a mother and a father (as archetypes)? He discusses different kinds of love: brotherly love (love to any other human being - just because he is a human being), erotic love, self-love, love to God. The last half of the book is dedicated to how love disintegrates in modern western society and how we can practice love.+books
Excellent book for anyone in business or professional field+P+This book was part of my Professional Ethics class. I have to say I was very skeptical (as the textbooks are never fun and one guy gave it a poor review) at first. However, after reading the book I have learned a lot. Ethics is not a matter of conservative or liberal (if that's true than god himself has to be a liberal not to mention bible talked about ethical behavior too). This book focused on why we need ethics in business and how proper ethics enforcement can save a business from corruption and other questionable behavior which eventually may bring down a business (think Enron). It talked about both sides and didn't force someone's opinion on us rather helped us make our own decision which will be ethical and benefiting to the business. Although it was my text book I'd recommend this book to anyone as part of business strategy making.  +books
Don't waste 3 hours of lifespan reading this book+N+This book is widely known as a classic, but the reader is left wondering "why?" Protagonist (can't call him a hero) of this novel is poor farmer Ethan Frome, who lives a joyless existence with his hypochondriac wife. He finds some "excitement" when Mattie comes to visit, but again, the reader wonders why, because she's vapid and uninteresting.  To recap: we're presented with characters that aren't the least bit likable to begin with, and turn pages eagerly waiting for The Happy Ending. Instead, Wharton ends with all three characters living together and making each other even more miserable. I feel like I wasted three precious hours of lifetime reading this book. WHY???+books
Well researched and tolerably convincing+P+This is a very well researched book.  The author has taken great pains to measure and analyze Vermeer's paintings, finding a striking feature that many of them, when back-projected through the perspective view point at the size of the painting, imply a consistent location of a back wall to the common room used in the pictures.  The author asserts that the only reasonable explanation for this coincidence is that Vermeer used a camera obscura for at least some of the layout of his paintings.  This comes off as very plausible, though the analysis is limited to paintings that include a tiled floor.  It would have been interesting to see this work extended through photogrammetry of objects of known sizes in the paintings (chairs, musical instruments, etc) and applied to more of the paintings.  I think the only real failing in the argument is that Vermeer could have could have had the skill to paint perspective of this quality, and therefore not needed the aid of a camera.  As pointed out in the text, he was not bound to perfect accuracy; there are some deviations+books
An Engineer's View+P+This book was chosen as one of the books to be read and discussed by my men's book club. The author's treatment of the creation is absolutely spell binding and very convincing to an engineer. The way in which the author finds God's face in so many things is interesting and absorbing. I had trouble putting it down, it reads so easily+books
an inspiring read+P+a wonderful book to read any time, but especially when you are searching for answers to why you hurt and how you can help yourself and your family not hurt anymore.  I love the idea that WE have the power to heal ourselves (some would say miraculously).  We DO NOT have to feel dependant upon the "Gods" of medicine and pharmacies in order receive a false "cure"  Heal yourself...for good!  Read this book then make a way to go to one of his classes.  It will change your life+books
Great+P+This book has been very helpful.  It is easy to read, it is easy to look things up in and provides a nice section on treatments of different disorders as well as describing the disorder+books
Yummy Food for Everyone!+P+I know, I know, I am the daughter of the author but I have to say  something about the book. (Remember one can be objective about a family  member). FIRST the quality of the food: I have been cooking a lot of these  recipes - some for the past 15 years and they are something to be proud of!  Really delicious and so easy.  Exceptional recipes (which I literally dream  about) include:  lima bean &amp; pea puree, the meat loaf, the split pea  soup, the rice pilaf, the bourbon cake, the red velvet cake and the chicken  fricassee. Just to name a few.  SECOND the variety of foods and recipes:  which is a tribute to the author and her life experiences and are truly  diverse!  Just look at how many cultures and countries are represented  here.  FINALLY, Tom Eckerle's photographs: which are exquisite and  transforms the book into not only a well-worn cookbook but a  &quot;coffeetable book&quot; as well.  My hats off to you, mom.  I'm proud  of you. How nice of you to share with everyone+books
This book was a snore+N+I've heard Mr. Ziglar speak in person and he was very humerous and captivating. Wish I could say the same of his Autobiography. He detailed his youth and his family to the boring extreme. He spoke very little about the type of work he does now - only about all the job changes he went through. Maybe I expected too much; but after hearing this man in person I expected much more+books
Having your cake and eating it, too!+N+Now that we have had the benefit of over two centuries of historical-critical biblical studies, we might now very well ask:  Where do we go from here?  I would offer that the fundamental working hypothesis of such studies is that "they made it all up" and so the scholarly task becomes one of reconstructing that process, but the unquestionable assumption behind it all is that anything, positively anything, is more credible than traditional Christian faith (this is amounts to, for the critical scholars, a doctrine of "justification by doubt").    And so the game proceeds.  Canonical scripture is called upon, and even appealed to, when it can be interpreted to support the working assumption that nothing at all is what it might seem when it comes to Christian origins.  But whenever scripture supports a traditional understanding, then it is systematically demolished, discredited, decoded, and rejected as the purely ideological product it most assuredly is.  And all of the other texts, the schismatic, heterodox materials and the Gnostic drivel--which the Church had its apostolic reasons to reject--must simply be seen for what they are, and not evidence of Christianity's original "denominational" condition.  Bart Ehrman is a most clever and educated man, but, contrary to what some might assume, he DOES approach the material at hand with a clear bias and set of preconceived understandings.  So let's forget all the by now stale appeals to scholarly objectivity (not to mention, personal integrity) and letting "the sources speak for themselves", because that is just so much fantasizing as well.  Traditional Christian faith is dismissed by Ehrman and his ilk as being simply one more product of identifiable historical forces and thus it has no intrinsic claim to truth.  But try reading the Bible with the assumption that it is all true, that what it tells us about who Jesus of Nazareth is, and the beginnings of His Church are a reliable enough account of what did happen.  I realize that such an enterprise is inconceivable to the scholarly guild (with the refreshing exception of people like Luke Timothy Johnson and N.T. Wright), but philology is not faith, and in the end, it should never even be considered as a basis for it.    Ehrman's reconstructions are thus of interest only to a person who would treat any kind of 'faith' resulting from it as a kind of personal plaything, and not as the daily challenge to his own being. Remember, Christian faith is ultimately about God and our relationship with Him, and not about the way in which we might choose to arrange the intellectual games we play with faith and our musings upon it.   If you are interested in keeping God at arm's length and not dealing with real issues of personal growth and spiritual integrity (the kind that comes not from footnotes but from abiding in the Holy Spirit), then buy this book, read it, and enjoy whatever feelings of superiority it might give you.  But if not, if you are seeking the one, true living God who awaits those who would believe in Him through His Son Jesus, who is the Christ, then forget about it and all the other 'ragings of the pagans'.  You see, they are the ones you will be able to spot on the closeout shelf.   +books
A perfect example of King's boredom with writing+N+It took me less than a day and a half to read this book. And thats not because i was "glued to it" or "thought it was a real page-turner" but basically because it was a real fast read. However, this book, as i stated, is a perfect example of Stephen King's boredom with writing horror/fiction. His work within the last decade especially, has taken some well deserved criticism. Based on the concept that most of his recent books are churned out in a "cookie-cutter" method. Now, don't get me wrong, King is responsible for some of the most compelling stories ever. Stories that seem to transcend the "horror genre", and incorporate elements of mystery, romance, and drama. However, this is not one. I would rate this book only behind "Insomnia" as the most insipid King novels i've ever read. I don't know how to explain it to those who have not read most of King's work. But for those who have, it will make sense when i say that about a quarter of the way into the book, i found myself thinking "oh....it's going to be another one of THESE stories huh?" THESE meaning a really generic character, and a foreseeable "generic" villian, ultimately squaring off in a very "generic" ending. halfway through, i could already see how it was going to end. And this is one of those books where King's references to East coast culture are going to take precedence over the quality of the finished product. Some examples of King's finest work would be "The Talisman", "Night Shift"(THE best collection of short horror stories ever), The Shining, The "Dark Tower" sieries, and The Stand, just to name a few. And if you have not read any of "The Bachman books" (King as Bachman) "Rage", "The Long Walk", Road Work", and "The Running Man", are some of the most well written, and mind-bending stories ever told.  This, however, isn't. And unless you can purchase this book for under $2.00 don't waste your money, or your time.      +books
NOT CONVINCING+N+THE FIRST 60 OR SO PAGES ARE JUST AWFUL. JOHN KEEGAN ARGUES THAT WAR IS NOT THE CONTINUATION OF POLITICS RATHER THE RESULT OF CULTURAL DRIVES. THAT MAY WELL HAVE BEEN SO IN HISTORICAL TIMES, BUT IS HARDLY SO TODAY. HE UNFORTUNATELY TRIES TO EXPLAIN AGGRESSION AND VIOLENCE FROM A BIOCHEMICAL PERSPECTIVE AND IS NOT ONLY DATED, HE'S FLAT WRONG. THERE'S OTHER PROBLEMS WITH HIS KNOWLEDGE, I.E., CLAIMING THE U.S. ABANDONED THE DRAFT AFTER WW II AND DIDN'T USE IT AGAIN UNTIL THE 60'S. WRONG AGAIN! WHAT IS INTERESTING IS THAT KEEGAN'S VERY VIEWS ARE SO MUCH A CONTINUATION OF BRITISH POLITICAL THINKING. NOT A GREAT BOOK AT ALL+books
Wow+P+Another great book, which comes as no surprise. The first book ends with him being removed from his home, permanently, due to his mother's abuses. This book gives us an insider's look at the foster home system, flaws and all, which rings quite true. I spent a week there myself, and have some delinquent cousins with a bit more experience. I suppose it'd shock a lot of readers, however. Meanwhile, what shocked me was that his mother was still part of his life. Grr! Great book. It's brilliant as well, and naturally I expect the same of the third part in this trilogy. +books
Another soap opera +N+There is no doubt that Antonia Fraser's "The Journey" is written in the author's usual wry, witty and highly engaging style (although I must say that I never before heard of sex described as "lugubrious.") There is also no doubt that Fraser has done a great deal to redeem Marie-Antoinette's shredded reputation by accurately describing her as being compassionate to the hardships of the French people. The book is full of vivid detail which makes it very readable. However, I was disappointed to see that Fraser resorts to many popular misconceptions. For one thing, why does Fraser act like Marie Antoinette was the only princess to be sent away from home as a teenager to seal a dynastic marriage? What about Sophie of Anhalt-Zerbst (Catherine the Great) who was also a young stranger in a foreign land? This sort of thing happened all the time - it was what being a princess was all about. I was glad that Fraser did not fall into the myth of Louis XVI's impotence/ phimosis and surgery and all that. She simplistically portrays him as being asexual, which was not true, because he told his aunt after consummating his marriage that he enjoyed "it." But never has any other biographer subjected the reader to the spectacle of Fersen and the queen fiddling with  primitive prophylactics while consummating their grand passion. I must say, it is a first. Fraser insists that Marie Antoinette slept with Fersen for many years and yet gives no solid proof, while at the same time maintaining that she was a woman of high moral character. I usually do not think of a woman who is shared by both a lover and a husband as having a high moral character, but I guess Fraser does. Oh, well. It is such romantic fantasies that turn this book into more of a soap opera than a serious biography. I found it absurd when Fraser insists that the tormented queen of France was ultimately a martyr for the cause of the socialism and democracy which the French people now enjoy. If the queen had had her way, her descendant would be reigning today, and that is just the reality of it. For a better study of Marie Antoinette's relationship with her husband, I would recommend Vincent Cronin's "Louis and Antoinette." As for better biographies of the queen, let me join some fellow reviewers in the hope that the works of Delorme and Bertieres will soon be available in English+books
vampire Christopher+N+Christopher Byron's sensibility indicates that he is a small-minded, pathologically envious little weasle of a man, who tries to puff up his empty meaningless life by attempting to denigrate a great woman who has brought great beauty and grace to our culture.  Unless you're one of those nasty-spirited people who find glee in joining the pack of hyenas who hate powerful, brilliant, talented women because the light from great women's souls is too bright and reveals too vividly your pathetic life, avoid this book. Byron is simply a mean little vampire, trying to suck money and notoriety from the life blood of Martha.  Shame on John Wiley &amp; Sons for publishing this book+books
Oops -- Honan's Errors+N+I found 23 factual errors in Honan's book -- when I mentioned this to someone I was told that a reader in Virginia had found 142.  There are much better biographies of Jane Austen out there -- for starters, no one has yet surpassed Elizabeth Jenkins', first published in the 1930s, and a fine recent one, a good introduction to JA's life, is Maggie Lane's latest, Jane Austen's World.  Don't be put off by the fact that it is slick and, as they say, richly illustrated -- it's readable, sound and remarkably complete despite its size+books
Weak Link in a Great Series+N+I read A is for Alphabet years ago and did not get pulled into the series.  Years later I read S is for Silence and was hooked. I started to read the series--backwards at first and then jumped to the beginning.  I have really enjoyed the books and felt a connection to the heroine (and forgiven Ms. Grafton for making her weigh 118 lbs on her 5'6" frame).  However, I agree with the other readers who feel like this is not Grafton at her best.  You just can't believe that Kinsey would put herself in these ridiculous positions---belting a police officer to endear herself to a woman she is investigating, remaining in an incredibly (and unbelievable) dangerous situation, to name a few.  The dialogue is weak,the sexual situations seem gratutitous, and there is a fair amount of stereotyping of hispanics.  But even with these issues, I did finish the book.  Grafton at her low point is still a good read+books
book tries hard but accomplishes nothing+N+Over the years I have had an avid interest in the paranormal.  I have read books by numerous authors, and looked forward to this book being one of the best.  I found however a book that seemed to wander as though lost,and the author was searching for a direction to go with it but never quite found it.  I have taken my law enforcement training and experience, and coupled it with other books on this subject, and found the scientific methods of investigation to be very similar.  I am afraid that this book,apart from the poor spelling, and composition would be confusing to novice investigators, and would give them erroneous information, on a subject that is complicated to begin with.  I am sure Mr.Taylor means well, but there are much better books out there for the beginner,or the experienced investigator. The later version is no real improvement eithe+books
Kindred spirits...+P+In this collection of articles, Seth Godin not only gives many creative insights in what good business is all about, he also shows his love for customers.  Very insightful+books
Helpful and interesting+P+Having read and reread this book I feel confident in recommending it to anyone interested in learning to deal with with workplace conflict and cohabitation.  The author persuasively and logically argues that most workplace conflict is driven by fears that we may not even be aware of. Using the practical strategies put forth in the book has allowed me to gain greater understanding of where fears come from and how to cope with them. This book would be a valuable tool for anyone interested in turning discord into harmony, both at home and at work. The final section of the book suffers slightly from what felt to me like a shift in tone and emphasis. This part of the book seemed to be where the author became concerned with sharing his own personal worldview and therefore might be less useful for the hardcore business reader looking for workplace strategies to implement. That being said, I found this portion of the book to be interesting and enlightening to read simply as a human being and not as a "business person".  Highly recommended.+books
Very Annoyed!+N+I give this book a 1 star not because it wasn't interesting - it certainly was, but because the ending absolutely floored me!  Aghgh**&&*(7#!!!!!  I never thought it was going to end like that - where was the justice??  I feel like something is missing.  I want to reach into the book and smack Alex! Please tell me there is a follow-up book where Sam gets what's coming to him!!! -- Oh, and Daphne too+books
Complexity through connections+N+The work of Duncan J. Watts was admittedly inspired by the work of social-psychologist at Harvard University, Stanley Milgram, in the late 1967 on experiment on the problem called "small world" problem: "anyone person in the world could be reached through a network of friends in only a few steps; in Watts language, "after the cocktail party banter in which two strangers discover that they have a mutual acquaintance and remind each other what "a small world" it is. Surprisingly, Milgram's results led to the phrase "six degrees of separation": the degree of network of friends between me and you will never be more than six! I know someone who knows someone who knows someone else who knows someone that knows someone who becomes my friend!  I feel a must to urge the readers to read the book in order to understand further what science of network can give us. Among the popular books of networks, reading Watts' Six Degrees is important since the book was made seriously by the author for unlimited readers. It is a time for physics gives something valuable on constructing new scientific sociological work to day.   Hokky Situngkir Bandung Fe Institut+books
I loved this story+P+I would have to say it has everything, and is highly readable, which I think is an important recommendation to give potential readers of classic fiction.  It is beautiful, simple, filled with humor and compassion.  I particularly liked the way Hugo pokes fun at the absurdities of anti-Gypsy prejudice and other social bigotry.  Esmerelda's suitor, however, is a terrible selfish jerk in this story, which is far funnier and more believable than the selfless sap he plays in the Disney movie.  Altogether an unforgettable read, and an unforgettable character in the Hunchback, who Hugo paints with considerable humanity+books
Keynes never supported deficit finance(or functional finance)+N+J. M. Buchanan's(JMB)book is completely mistitled and out of date.Nowhere in any of Keynes's writings does Keynes ever advocate a policy of deficit finance,which is actually the brain child of Abba Lerner,a member of the American Keynesian-Neoclassical Synthesis school of economics.Lerner used the term functional finance to describe deficit finance.During a visit to America in 1944 as the representative of England's Treasury Department,Keynes totally disagreed with Lerner's approach.Keynes's approach is an advanced version of the cyclically balanced budget first laid out in clear terms to the Pharaoh by Joseph some 3,700 years ago-build up a surplus in the good years that will cover the deficits of the bad years.This is the first statement of what economists call a countercyclical fiscal policy.Keynes's additional provision is that the budget be split into two categories-one of which would be a capital budget.The government could only run deficits in the provision of capital projects in public infrastructure(building dams,reservoirs,water projects-irrigation networks,seaports,airports,public transportation projects,public schools,colleges and universities,public research laboratories,etc.,)that would pay for themselves in the long run.Nor was Keynes an advocate of tax cuts in an economic downturn except for temporarily suspending the  social security tax for workers only.Keynes's major policy recommendation was the maintenance of low interest rates combined with a central bank policy of eliminating loan availability for speculative undertakings(greenmail,leveraged buyouts,hostile takeovers,margin account loans,corporate raiders,junk bonds,etc.).The correct title for JMB's book up until 1981 is"Democracy with minor to moderate deficits:The Political Legacy of the American Keynesian-Neoclassical Synthesis School".After 1981,JMB should have retitled his book as"Democracy and Catastrophic Deficits:The Political Legacy of Laffer,Reagan,and the 12 years of the Two  Bush Presidencies" .The national debt when President Reagan took office stood at 925 billion dollars.As of July,2005,the national debt will have surpassed 8 trillion dollars.The Libertarian-pseudo conservative policies of tax cuts,borrowing and excessive spending of  8 years of Reagan and 12 years of the two Bush presidencies has increased our national debt by a factor of 9.JMB needs to completely rewrite his book.First,he needs to incorporate the theoretical foundations of the story of Joseph and the Pharaoh from the Old Testament.He will probably need to purchase a bible in order to correctly cite verse and page.Second,he needs to obtain a copy of Keynes's General Theory and read what Keynes actually wrote and not what Henry Hazlitt claims what Keynes meant in his 1959 "Failure of the 'New Economics'".  +books
Who is this about?+N+I bought and read this book for a class and found it very difficult to take much away from. The accounts are potentially very enlightening, but the author's writing style obfuscates their values. Her interjection of her own personal stories into the work was sloppy and often left me unsure of who I was reading about. While I don't know of any other book which tells these stories, there are many other books that contain similar accounts which are far more effective+books
Eh...+N+This book was a bit typical for my liking. The setting was stereotypical only to be mixed in with bland characters, all told through a horribly punctuated journal of a tenth grader who seems like someone who should still be in middle school. Through this story Jeremy, our lead man, experiences the many things which high schoolers encounter. And what are these things? Why smoking, drinking, partying and sex of course! All told through immature eyes, making this book one which I did not enjoy very much..+books
Thomas groome transformed my vision to religious education.+P+I've already read this book 13 years before. At that time I was a seminarian  and very interested in the catechesis. When I finished this book, I had to change my focus from the boring knowledge to the wondering  life. He presented 5 steps from the abundant sources of philosophical,  psychological, educational, and religious theories.         Now I have been  ordained to being a priest. I am re-reading this book. There are lots of  needs to be changed in my attitude for education as before. This book is a  kind of mirror for correcting my makeup. Life is always more important than  any others. Our story and vision of life should be effected by Jesus Story  and Vision of life. Thomas gives us an appropriate method.         On the  other hand, I think this book should be revised for practical needs.  Frankly,It's really hard yet to get understanding+books
Real world mystery made tedious+N+So much could have been done with this story, but was not. While this book shines at descriptions of political events, it utterly fails to give context a current reader will need, and by indulging in every whim of detail without giving as clear a picture as even would have been needed in the time, it inundates us with fragments without showing a convincing experience. I hope Woodward and Bernstein wrote better newspaper stories, because while I was compelled to read the content of this book, it was not a pleasant venture into highly repetitive, aimless description. Not sure I'd recommend this to anyone, no matter how many overpaid hacks call it a "classic.+books
Excellent - very well written+P+This book brought both tears and empathy to myself and everyone else who suffers intense and real depression - to hear someone so eloquently describe the various chapters and measures of depression ("Suicide, etc") - this is an enormous and life work of incredible literature and an accountancy of the horrors and nature of depression. I highly recommend this book to anyone suffering the very darkness of depression - which I cannot describe, yet this author does an incredible job of doing such - to those dealing with those they love working though and understanding depression. Highly, highly recommended. I cannot accolade this book or write enough to express my gratitude and comfort (in hearing/knowing of others - including the author) of other's darkenss which we label as "depression" -- I just wish I was as good an author or writer as this; I am in amazement in the manner which the author has explained the nature of melancholy -- depression -- and the darkness which it covers+books
Great book+P+Hiroshima by John Hersey is great book and I would recomend to anyone that they should read it.  Hiroshima is about the dropping of the first A-bomb on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945.  Tells true stories of several surivors from the moment of the bombing to their years after the bombing.  This book truly stands up to expectations of "Who is able to read, should read this book."  I think that everyone should read this book, not only for pleasure but for the true understanding of the Atomic bombing on Hiroshima through true stories told by people still alive today+books
Waste of money+N+98% of this thin book is about how many buttons a certain uniform had on it and what type of boots a certain unit wore.  Almost nothing about the Italian Army of WWII was in it.  A more appropriate title would have been "The Uniforms of the Italian Army 1940-45: Africa"+books
Functional and Fun; The New Knitting Book+P+I LOVED this book. I picked it up on a whim and spent the next two hours reading and laughing. The patterns are fun and these girls are so funny. I think this is a great book to have in my library. It has several patterns that I really want to make as gifts and I think even the book would make a great gift to any knitter+books
Glad to be done with it.+N+Predator is the worst book I have read in 2 months (I read a lot of books).  It is too dis-jointed and incongruous and lacks cohesiveness of plot and events.  The characters are poorly drawn (I hardly recognized the Scarpetta and Marino of earlier books).  The transition to reveal the perpetrator was abrupt and weak, leaving me feeling: "HUH??" This the fourth (and it will be the last) book by Cornwell that I have read.  It was totally disappointing and I spent extra time on it just so I could complete it and "Forget about it"+books
Another winner from Mr. Parish+P+This is a fascinating book about one of the best (relatively)young directors working.  As usual, Mr. Parish has done his homework.  The background material is great and helps give a really vivid picture of the person.  I really feel I got to know Mr. Van Sandt from reading this book, not only him, but his family and associates growing up.  The descriptions of his early works are especially interesting.  Mr. Parish is one of the most thorough writers when it comes to work credits of his subjects.  I also enjoy this section of his books.  I definitely recommend this book+books
Her Weakest by Far+N+I've read all of Nevada Barr's Anna Pigeon books and enjoyed every one of them until I reached Hard Truth. After writing so many intellligent, suspenseful stories, Barr has joined what seems to be an open competition among mystery writers to see who can come up with the most despicable crime. Murder's not nasty enough? How about the murder of children? Still not gruesome enough? Add incest/rape/torture...you get the picture.  Ostensibly such books are meant to give the reader insight into the minds of evil villains, but really, who cares? The kind of evil depicted in these books is not just disgusting but banal. It's like bad language in humor--in general, it's just a cover for bad writing.   In Hard Truth, Barr outdoes all of the competition for sheer nastiness, in the process leaving out the features that make her other books so enjoyable: the charm and intelligence of her main charcter, the well-reasoned defense of nature, the lush descriptions of each story's setting. I found this book neither enlightening nor remotely enjoyable. I give it two stars for an interesting but largely wasted character (a recently paralyzed ice climber), but otherwise I'm sorry I spent my time and money on it+books
great book+P+This book never gets old.  It's timeless and always fun to read+books
it is ok+N+this was certainly not one of Cornwell's best works.  IT was almost like a couple of possible novels rolled into one.  It read like a draft for a novel rather tahn a complete novel+books
Historical Endnote+N+Like Hayek's Road to Serfdom, this book was written during the Secon World War when Keynes was busy crafting the post war peace. It is infused with the 1930s' corporatist ideas and tends to favour the Communist version more than the Nazi/Fascist version. Keynes is indisputably the 2oth century's most important economist but why does Schumpeter and his creative destruction occupy position #2? I put it down to the same reason as Marx' Theory of Alienation gained such sway. As there was little else to salvage from Marx' writings, they hit on that to make him apear relevant. Marx was a dangerous idiot and the fact that Schumeter heaps measured praise on him suggests that Schumpeter should also join him in the intellectual trash can of history. I see little relevant in his work which I feel has gained prominence simply because economics has lost its intellectual direction. Unlike Gary Becker and other recipients of the Nobel Prize, Schumpeter tackles big issues. But the big issues shrug him off. Nothing here to ponder over+books
Let me save you $12.21 today.+N+This has to be my least favorite of my Kiyosaki collection.  I will sum it up for you...think and know the power of Leverage, Passive income is taxed at a lower rate than Earned income, and you gotta buy assets!  There, you can continue shopping+books
What the Heck is This???+N+This little book is, in my opinion, a really poor attempt at humor and a huge disappointment to the wonderful Bridget Jones diaries.  If  you have read the Bridget Jones books, then this little book is unnecessary since it is just regurgitated material from her diaries.  However, if you have not read the Bridget Jones diaries yet, I highly suggest you do that first since this little book might be a turn-off if you don't know what you are dealing with ahead of time.  This book contains silly pictures of how to shove things under your bed before company comes and how to call for Domino's delivery...(yes, there are pictures showing the reader how to dial the telephone, but it doesn't stop there.  We also get photographic details on how to open the box and put the pizza in our mouths!)  If this kind of information could be useful to you then, by all means, get this book.  However, if you are like most of us and already know how to dial a telephone, stick a slice of pizza in your mouth, shove things under your bed and step on a bathroom scale, then I suggest you save your (money)+books
A MUST READ+P+I love Greg Iles! Have been a fan since Spandau Phoenix - Mortal Fear is Iles' second offering and it is one of my all time favorite books. It deals with computer technology and a computer sex site - and a killer who is using it for his prey. The use of character developement is astounding and the tension is nonstop. For those who like Iles, and haven't read his earlier works, this is really a must read - if you are a fan of this genre and have missed this one - you will be thrilled+books
Lost  $10+N+I was waiting for something to happen in this book but nothing did. There is no plot, the characters described very poorly and the writing is definitely unimpressive (I would not mind the writing so much if the plot was there). Throughout the whole book all the main character does is answers the phone and gets coffee ... how exciting is that?  +books
Just not that into it.+N+I also didn't like it. I don't see what the hype is about it personally. I thought Girlfriends Guide to Pregnancy was great but this one doesn't tell you anything that common sense wouldn't! I say if you want to try it out, use the library. That way you aren't wasting your money on it+books
Fantastic Cookbook+P+I am a cookie-aholic and have many, many cookbooks.  This one is great and has lots of interesting, non-standard recipes, such as granola bars, cinnamon bun cookies, etc.  I have made many of the recipes and have had no complaints - only compliments+books
Sad...+N+Even if one is sympathetic to Groothuis's broad concern, one can't help but be disappointed with this text. This book is a bad regurgitation of other bad and reductive non-readings of `pomo'. Groothuis depends way too highly on secondary (and sometimes tertiary) sources. It escapes me how a former reviewer could call this work `scholarly.' I suppose if one considers Logic 101 tinged with the usual fundamentalist `defender of the Faith' rhetoric and aura (which hovers over every page), then this could be called `scholarly.'   The big problem I found is that even when Groothuis offers defensible criticisms, his alternatives end up being just as problematic as the positions he criticizes. For all his advocacy for a correspondence theory of truth, his tone betrays a penchant for certainty and formal coherence. He falls into the problem of the relation between thought and `reality,' representation to presentation, the role of language, and so forth. No doubt God comes to save the day with all these problems, yet on the very justificatory terms Groothuis advocates for, God escapes the measure of correspondence and becomes its condition of possibility. In other words, God becomes a structural metaphysical function which `saves' Groothuis's truth from the skeptic. The problem, however, is that Groothuis wants truth to be absolute, universal, and accessible to all, yet he is dependent on a moment (i.e. faith) which, by definition, retains a trace of contingency or `objective' undecidability.    Groothuis's more ethical concerns are where I am more sympathetic, but again, here his polemics and non-reading of the people he criticizes drowned out whatever constructive points he offers. Groothuis practices the same type of irresponsible reflection that some of the `pomo' Evangelical's do: uncriticality. Here, philosophy and reflection - whether Modern or postmodern - becomes a means to simply confirm and justify a complacent status quo, rather than challenging and transforming the status quo. The challenge presented in this book is for a nostalgic return to the good old days of Christendom.   Jesus did not come to `save' our metaphysical systems, but to redeem us and this world. That redemption is not contingent upon accurate representations as Groothuis seems to think. It is madness to the Greek (i.e. the logician) and a stumbling block to the Legalist (i.e. moralistic hypocrites). The task is not to make the faith less crazy or more socially repressive. As James tells us, the measure of `true' faith - and here I will grant a type of reference - is that we `attend to the widow and orphan.' Kerygma without service is dead, a worse lie than any humanism. Perhaps if we began `proving' our faith, that is, manifesting its truth in radical service and justice - we could actually demonstrate the truth to which we testify. I guess it is much easier to `defend the faith' with bad arguments which only convince the already convinced, than to `live the faith': serve the people no one gives a hoot about. After all, in the latter case one cannot fancy oneself a hero in quite the same way.   +books
Sadly, this is a message that further divides the world+N+I heard an interview with Dr. Kushner on NPR today.  He explained how the comfort in the 23rd Psalm lies in the realization that, for example, God is not on the side of the terrorists, or the hurricanes; he is on our side.  Why define the world as divided so in the first place?  Terrorists are people too.  Nature is people too.  Until we accept the fact that God is in all of us, we will continue to place things in "good" and "evil" bins and only strengthen the hatred and suffering in the world.  Our comfort and relief from Psalm 23 will only revitalize us to more intensely resist those things that we (WE, not God or some divine law of the universe) label as evil.  I rate the book 2 stars instead of 1 because it is clear the author means well and has a heart of gold, full of compassion.  Unfortunately his wonderful intentions are sorely misguided.+books
This book ruined my golf game.+N+After reading this book, I caught a duck to use on the links. Despite naming it Ping, my distance and putting went down the toilet. I would not suggest using Ping for your average hacker+books
A Painful and Slow Read+N+This book reads like a graduate thesis. It manages to bury interesting ideas with overly drawn out explanations and arguments. Each chapter should be pared down to a third of its length, but I recommend not finding out for yourself; spend your money elsewhere+books
Unbiblical and bad writing make for one star+N+This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck.  Re: J Czecholinski Hey J, you couldn't be more wrong! Your review is as flawed as Lahaye and Jenkin's unbiblical writing. First, I am a Christian who does believe that Jesus is coming back, but I do not believe He is coming back in a secret, silent rapture that the LEFT BEHIND series is making millions of Christians believe. I believe in the verse you used (to try and prove me wrong), which is 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 : 'For the Lord himself will come down from heaven with a commanding shout,with the call of the archangel,and with the trumpet call of God. First,all the Christians who have died will rise from the graves.Then,together with them,we who are still alive and remain on the earth will be caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and remain with Him forever.' When Jesus comes back, we will know it. Keys words being COMMANDING SHOUT and TRUMPET CALL OF GOD. We're not going to be zapped up while others are standing around for 7 years. In the Bible, 7 years refers to completeness or totality, which is time until Jesus comes back for good. Lahaye and Jenkins are taking figurative language from John's revelation and making them literal and adding their own spin to sell books and make movies. This adding to Scripture and polluting the word of God makes me think of Galatians 1:6-9 which says: "I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you by the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel--which is really no gospel at all. Evidently some people are throwing you into confusion and are trying to pervert the gospel of Christ. But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let him be eternally condemned! As we have already said, so now I say again: If anybody is preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted, let him be eternally condemned!" This is what Lahaye and Jenkins are doing: perverting the gospel with their own spin. And your "belief" in the anti-Christ is incorrect as well (along with Lahaye and Jenkins). Check out these verses: 1st John 2:22 "Who is the liar? It is the man who denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a man is the antichrist--he denies the Father and the Son." or 1st John 4:3 "...but every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world." Key words their being EVEN NOW IS ALREADY IN THE WORLD. This is referring to SATAN who was in the world in John's day and still in the world. The Bible says in 1st John 2:18 that many anti-Christs have come and anti-Christ is anyone who is against Christ. There are many people who are persecuting the Church and Christians (as this is the last days that we are living - check out 2nd Timothy 3). Why are we looking for somebody like Nicholae when there are already those who have the spirit of the Anti-Christ? Why are polluting the word of God to try and sell books and movies. Why are we allowing ourselves to be eternally condemned because we are starting to follow this new type of thinking? Do you think that the disciples, when Jesus ascended to heaven, thought that there would be a silent rapture followed by tribulation? No! Finally, you said that 2nd Corinthians 6:2 says: "TODAY is the day of salvation I'm looking SO forward to that day when the Lord will come for me and all born again believers that we won't HAVE to endure the tortures during the Tribulation." What bible version are you looking at. 2nd Corinthians 6:2 clearly states: "For he says, 'In the time of my favor I heard you, and in the day of salvation I helped you.' I tell you, now is the time of God's favor, now is the day of salvation." Nothing about Tribulation and nothing about enduring tortures!!! You are just making up Scripture, perverting the GOSPEL! Now verse 4 talks about troubles (lower-case "t"), hardships, distresses, etc. That is happening now, today until Jesus comes back with a commanding shout and trumpet call of God to take us to heaven and those against him into eternal judgement - no 7 year tribulation period!!! Live today like it was your last day, because you could die or Jesus could come back (and believe me, you will know it because until you can show me verses where a silent, secret rapture will take place and there will be those left behind battling for seven years, I will continue to follow the God-breathed word of God and not fluff of Lahaye and Jenkins. "Tribulation" is found once in the bible (Rev 7:14 NIV) and it is with a lower-case "t" and has nothing to do about what the books suggest. "Rapture" never appears as this is a word that hasn't been around that long. So in summary, Jesus is coming back and we will know about it (whether you are a Christian or not). And off the subject, yes, baptism is essential to becoming a Christian and being saved (not praying Jesus into your heart)...it seems that the same people who believe in Lahaye's rapture are usually wrong on that issue as well. Please do yourself a favor. Read the Bible and follow it. If you do that, then you won't be led astray by these false teachings of someone like J. Czecholinski who cannot even get his Scriptures straight.   Re: J. Czecholinski Wow, J Czecholinski's perverting of the Scripture is uncanny. Somehow, he has gotten this vision and received a new gospel along with Lahaye and Jenkins. Most of his words are empty, his verses taken out of context, the use of visions in Revelation taken literal, and his best response is this: "This thought process has dominated rapture writings for the past 25 years." Wow, 25 years! Forgot about centuries of beliefs that the disciples have passed down and Jesus's own words and the Scriptures (again I point to the verses you brought up 1st Thessalonians 4:16-17 - LOUD COMMAND and TRUMPET CALL OF GOD!!!). And then he tries to debate the baptism issue which Jesus and the disciples have passed down, but in the last 100 years new thinkers have changed that to just "pray Jesus into your heart", although there are many verses about baptism being essential and ZERO about praying Jesus into your heart (Big one being said by Peter, a disciple of Jesus in Acts 2:38 "Peter replied, "Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit." Then there is: Matt 3:11, John 3 (water and Spirit!), Acts 2:41, Acts 8:12-16, Acts 8:36-38, Acts 9:18, Acts 19:3-5, Acts 22:16, ROMANS 6, 1 Corinthians 12:13, 1 Corinthians 15:29, Galatians 3:27, Ephesians 4:5, Colossians 2:12, and the list goes on and on although the Bible never says to pray him into your heart! I think the disciple Peter said it best in 1st Peter 3:18-22 "For Christ died for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God. He was put to death in the body but made alive by the Spirit, through whom also he went and preached to the spirits in prison who disobeyed long ago when God waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ark was being built. In it only a few people, eight in all, were saved through water, and this water symbolizes baptism that now saves you also--not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a good conscience toward God. It SAVES you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ, who has gone into heaven and is at God's right hand--with angels, authorities and powers in submission to him." Don't try to say that baptism is a good work and compare it to Ephesians 2:8 and take it out of context. Salvation requires: Believe, Confess, Repent, Baptism, and living by your faith. That is the belief that Jesus and the apostles have passed down for 2000 years. So J, you can go ahead and listen to thought of the last 25 to 100 years by man, but as for me, I will listen to the Scriptures and to Jesus and to Paul and the apostles. For Paul says in Galatians 1:12 "I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ." So there you go.+books
Sad and strange.+N+I so do not understand all the rave reviews on this book. I read it recently for a book club selection, and let me tell you, If I didn't have to read it, I would have put it down after the first twenty pages, and never picked it up again. I found it to be dark, depraved, disgusting, and depressing! An examination of love in all it forms? Hardly! These characters were just plain goofy. I finally figured it out towards the end of the book, these characters were so miserable because they were lost spiritually. They were looking to other humans to provide them with true love, and that is just barking up the wrong tree. I am giving it one star only for the rich use of language+books
A MUST read for everyone interested in terrorism and politics.+P+As I read some of the reviews of people specifically one regarding David Ray Griffin books compared to this I must wonder about their motives. Although I have not read his books I read a few summaries, and concluded on some of the differences between them. David Ray Griffin seems to put all the blame and cover up on the Bush administration; it also seems to claim that there were explosives throughout the towers causing them to come down and not just the planes. It also claims that the pentagon plane never was a plane.   So how do you compare; Peter Lance doesn't claim that the Clinton administration or Bush Administration knowingly lied, it does however criticize both administrations for not looking into things like they should have. Obviously the Clinton Administration takes a harder hit here because they were in office from 93 - 00 when most of the planning took place. (yes I know it is hard for many bush haters not to put all the blame on Bush but this attack was planned well before Jan 1, 2001).   Peter Lance goes into extreme detail regarding the people involved in the 93 bombing and the people hunting/prosecuting them. There were so many things that were missed on all levels of our government from local police to the FBI to the white house. He does focus on the FBI's failure more than many other law enforcement because they are the group involved here at home. There are no conspiracy theories, the 93 world trade center attack happened; we know who did it. The USS Cole was attacked, Khobar Towers, the 2 embassies in Africa and 9/11. To suggest that some or any of these were committed or covered up by our goverment is insane.   Peter Lance details that there are people out there that are making their living trying to kill Americans and their allies. He gives us names, faces actual details. A history lesson in New York City law enforcment. There have been numerous books written about many of the same poeple or by the same people that Peter Lance mentions; John O'neil, Bob Baer etc... Read those books many say the same thing. SO is everyone on the government payroll covering up the White House Empires????  This book is based in facts that occured up to 9/11; it gives details and criticizes many people and administrations for not looking past the tips of their noses. It isn't based on conspiracy theories and is a great book. This book should be read by anyone wanting to know how inadequate our domestic law enforcment is at handling the new terrorist threat+books
Mad, Mad times over Mad Libs+P+This collection of mad libs were hilarious.  It had everybody in the room in stitches.  Plus, it was a great review of what verbs, adjectives, adverbs, etc. are+books
Basically, its a big, anti-jobs rant.  Don't be conned.+N+I've been in the software industry for quite awhile, and I've watched as the personal computer industry evolved from one where there were dozens of machines being sold to consumers down to the two primary platforms of windows and macintosh.  While there is no doubt that the macintosh is the minority platform, there is also no doubt that its continued survival has engendered an unexplained amount of hate from those who are not fans of the machine.   This book, in summary, is the longwinded rant of one such user. As someone who knows first hand a number of the situations covered in the book, and who has a generally solid understanding for situations not covered in the book, I believe the author of this book sat down and wrote it out by himself without any fact checking, without any real interviews (or he ignored or misunderstood the people he interviewed).  There are so many factual errrors in this book, its not funny- -from little things like the years events happened or the locations of companies or the person who held a particular role at a particular time, to grossly innacurate assumptions about things the author could not possibly know-- such as the minutes of boardroom discussions.   This is a smear job, thru and thru, and like most smear jobs its repetitive, self-contradictory, and downright dishonest.  I think the only reason the author has not been sued is that doing so would give this book far more attention than it deserves.  Windows fans like to kick apple and the mac, even when they are down.  Windows seems to engender some sociopathic sadism in people.   IF you want to learn more about apple, find another book... this book is just a windows fan bashing steve jobs for having taste+books
horribly boring+N+this book was so terribly boring that it made me come close to tears when knowing that i had to read this book for a project. There are no clif notes, spark notes, etc. for this book and there should be. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME READING THIS BOOK! it has no twist, and i can't even imagine how there could be one, considering that it was the same boring historical detail over and over and over again. if you must read this book, i recommend some strong coffee and some valium+books
A terrible oversight+N+I generally respect Hillman, but he has wildly misconstrued the nature of war.  His basic failure is an utter lack of examining the gendered nature of warfare.  In short: Men make war.  Yes, there plenty of instances where women engage in war, but those are far and away the exception and not the rule.  Both the leaders who build wars and the soldiers who fight them are almost exclusively male.  This is a consistent fact across all cultures around the globe and throughout history.  Broadly speaking, women simply do not make war.  This single and glaring oversight immediately destroy's Hillman's hypothesis that war is somehow a universal human archetype+books
REFRESHING!+P+I purchased this novel nearly ten years ago. At the time of the purchase, I did not realize that it was a series. So, this book lay gathering dust on my bookshelf, until one day I completely ran out of novels to read. I picked it up, and I was captivated after the first few pages. I didn't want to start the book without reading the ones prior. Fortunately, Jonathan Kellerman is a good enough writer to write a series that does not have to be read in order! This novel-The Clinic-is one of the most fast paced that I've ever read. I could not put this book down for the life of me. I had to know the who's, the when's, why's, and how's that were so skillfully placed! There are so many twists and turns to keep the reader interested, and so much information into the lives of the characters. I recommend this to anyone that enjoys a good novel, especially one that is just as much of a mystery as it is a suspenseful thriller+books
Engaging exercises to train your intuition+P+Famous mathematicians have often emphasized the role of visual intuition;  e.g., Hilbert: &quot;Who does not always use along with the double  inequality a &gt; b &gt; c the picture of three points following one  another on a straight line as the geometrical picture of the idea  &quot;between&quot;? Who does not make use of drawings of segments and  rectangles enclosed in one another, when it is required to prove with  perfect rigor a difficult theorem on the continuity of functions or the  existence of points of condensation?&quot; (from his famous address at the  1900 International Congress). This book is a collection of well over 100  one-page proofs, collected from various sources. The topics range from  number theory to calculus, and most of them require no advanced  mathematics. Typically there is a statement of a result, with a labelled  diagram showing how it is &quot;proved&quot;; in some cases there are a few  auxiliary equations along with the picture. These are not simple, often  requiring quite a bit of thought before the &quot;Aha!&quot; moment.  Working through them is a valuable exercise for the student of  mathematics--having seen, e.g., six different visual proofs of the  Pythagorean theorem, one comes to really *understand* the result, not just  &quot;follow the logic&quot;. I have not encountered any better way than  this book to &quot;see&quot; how mathematical truth is discovered and  proved. It can be valuable as a supplement to courses through precalculus  and elementary calculus. Perhaps one of its best uses is to inspire  teachers to present results in a more lively way then  &quot;definition-theorem-proof&quot; or &quot;just memorize it&quot;+books
FULL of errors!+N+Great idea for the book BUT spoiled by incorrect facts and explanations on almost every page! Thus it is good if you use it for the questions but NOT the answers.  Someone (wish I had the time) needs to list all the corrections on a website (just a suggestion) for this book to be fully utilised - until the author can correct the mistakes. (if someone gets the website off the ground, I will gladly contribute correct answers)   Having said this, I am still glad I got the book for the questions and to be pointed in the right direction. If only the author would correct the answers....  Gavin ATP+books
The Best Of Catron+P+I remain firmly in agreement with my good friends, who wrote the critique below.  The very best of Catron's texts, this book inspires immediate enthusiasm and, therefore, interaction with the author.  I'll hang onto my  original hardcover copy until it turns to dust, and continue to use it  while both writing and teaching.  An inspired text+books
Connecting dots that don't appear to be related...+P+Got a great book the other day called The Medici Effect: What Elephants & Epidemics Can Teach Us About Innovation by Frans Johansson.  It about what happens when you step into that area called The Intersection...  Contents: Part 1 - The Intersection: The Intersection - Your Best Chance To Innovate; The Rise of Intersections Part 2 - Creating the Medici Effect: Break Down the Barriers Between Fields; How to Make the Barriers Fall; Randomly Combine Concepts; How to Find the Combinations; Ignite an Explosion of Ideas; How to Capture the Explosion Part 3 - Making Intersectional Ideas Happen: Execute Past Your Failures; How to Succeed in the Face of Failure; Break Out of Your Network; How to Leave the Network Behind; Take Risks and Overcome Fear; How to Adopt a Balanced View of Risk; Step into the Intersection Notes; Index; About the Author  The Medici Effect is all about the intersection of ideas, cultures, disciplines, and strategies in new and previously unexplored ways.  The term comes from the Medici family in Florence Italy in the 15th century.  A convergence of thinkers and doers all converged on Florence, which became ground zero for the Renaissance period.  New concepts thrived in that environment where people were learning and listening to each other, breaking out of their own fields to combine ideas into revolutionary new areas of study.  Johansson asserts (and correctly so, in my opinion) that innovation thrives in these "intersections" that are missed by many, but offer the best chance for breaking away from the "same old thing".  The book is extremely practical, in that all the chapters are driven by real-life examples of these intersectional thinkers.  You'll see how Richard Garfield combined the idea of collectables and gaming to come up with the mega-hit card game Magic: The Gathering.  The singer Shakira takes musical styles from widely different cultures and combines them into a sound that is all her own (and very popular to boot).  Eric Bonabeau studied the activities of ants searching for food and applied the observations to network routing and scheduling.  These and many other examples show how being a generalist (or at least open to other fields) can lead to connections not possible for highly specialized thinkers.  Johansson lays out steps you can take to place yourself in that constant flow of ideas, so that you can start seeing new possibilities in rather mundane unrelated things.  I was very impressed with this book, and have already started to look at events and ideas in a different light.  I'd recommend this read for anyone looking to spur their creativity beyond the norm...+books
Worth it just for the pictures+P+But the simple drawing technique is also useful. Great if you want to paint or draw expressively. The pictures are inspiring+books
Highly Recommended!+P+This is by far the best book on international adoption out there and I've looked at plenty. Actually, this book is for anyone thinking about any form of adoption because it has a great and succinct discussion and comparison of all forms of adoption.  Although the book goes on to a thorough coverage of international adoption, Davenport is clear that all forms of adoption should be considered and there is no one type of adoption that is best for everyone.  I love Davenport's thoroughness and her compassion for parents and kids.  The book covers everything a prospective parent needs to think about, but Davenport is nonjudgmental about many of the choices parent will have to make.  With each choice she urges parents to be honest with themselves and to put the interest of the child first.  Because we are at the beginning stages of considering adoption, I found the first couple of chapters most helpful: are we ready to move on to adoption, what type of adoption is best for us, how to choose a country, and how to choose an agency.  I especially loved the chapter on choosing a country and the charts at the back of the book on each of the top 17 (?) placing countries.  Davenport has a website [...] that keeps these charts up to date.  Regardless of which type of adoption we choose, I know that I will use the rest of the book as a reference, especially if we decide on international adoption.  Davenport takes your hand and walks you through absolutely every experience you may have from finding the money, to surviving the homestudy, to preparing the paperwork, to waiting for your child, to traveling to meet your child, to the first days together, to the first year home.  I liked her lists of questions to ask agencies, references, your child's caregiver, etc.  I also loved her section on attachment and how to help foster it.  She explained it in a way that I understood and left me feeling hopeful, not scared.  The Complete Book of International Adoption is a gem and a must for any parent thinking about adoption+books
How to destroy your relationship with your kids+N+Regrettably, I bought this book (for one cent) based on the strong reviews.  I will never put so much credence in reviews again.  This would definitely not be one that you would thumb through at the bookstore and buy.  The author appears to have been introduced to child psychology about five minutes before writing this book.  His methodology is extremely juvenile and naive.  His whole approach is to have an arsenal of canned phrases that you tell your kid for various circumstances.    This doesn't sound like a bad thing at first until you find out what unimaginative over-simplistic blabber that "Chick" offers.  I could point out samples from every page of the first 25 that I read and the dozen or so others that I then skimmed through.  Just quoting this pansy-ass fluff turns my stomach.  Here is a story he tells a speaker who was distracted by a couple of kids talking at a lecture...   "Frowning, he looked at them and very quietly said 'I'm feeling distracted by your behavior.  Please make a different choice.' By telling these students to make a different choice the speaker used language that communicated respect.  His message informed them 'I see you as responsible for your own actions.  You control your behavior.  You choose your responses to life.'  Every page has this same sickening tone to it.  If you want to avoid reality and miss the opportunities to affect your children in a way that builds self-esteem and confidence in them with real heart to heart interaction and instead gum them up with garbage talk then this book is for you.  Otherwise, to quote the author "PLEASE MAKE A DIFFERENT CHOICE" and find a better book or just use your own intuition and common sense.  This book teaches you how to destroy relationships by talking in mumbo jumbo out of the side of your mouth, while trying to keep a straight face.  A one star rating gives this comic book way too much credit.+books
Lots of interesting examples +P+This book is filled with lots of interesting examples detailing life and attitudes in the fifties when the book was written. It is a book about how psychological research, motivational research was being employed at the time to sell Americans all kinds of things they did not necessarily really want, or weren't necessarily very good for them. Sounds very much like Reality as we now know it. This selling also extended to Politicians, and Packard foresaw the way the Image would become in many instances more important than the Message in choice of political candidates.  As I said the book is filled with information. I am embarassed to say that I have in all my years on this planet and at various dentists never learned Packard's great insight that it does not make much sense to focus one's truth-brushing activities in the morning after the microbes have had eight hours to work on one 's teeth. Brush after you eat, he advises, as I now recall many dentists have told me through the years. In any case this is an enjoyable read by someone who understands that Advertising is not simply manipulative and exploitative but also adds color and interest to the culture.+books
A successor to Dorothy Parker?+P+Fran Lebowitz is sometimes referred to as the successor to Dorothy Parker. A few similarities are apparent. Both are sharp-witted, female New Yorkers famous for their often stinging one-liners. Yet, if Parker could be considered a painter of the urban American landscape in the 1920s through 1950s, Lebowitz should be considered a sketch artist from the 1970s. I don't think she has Parker's depth or sense of structure. Her essays are playful but often amount to mere list making or an assemblage of loosely connected observations that could just as well belong on a greeting card or cocktail napkin. And she often relies way too heavily on puns. Several pieces in this collection fall flat for me. Yet others - such as her advice to heiresses, "At Home with Pope Ron," and "The Last Laugh" - were quite clever. I think she's worth reading as perhaps one of the leading humorists of her generation. Comparisons with the more versatile and compelling Parker are a bit of a stretch, though+books
Excellent Instruction for Insight Meditation+P+Insight (Mindfulness) Meditation - the Vipassana Meditation of Theravada Buddhism - can change your life whether you are Buddhist or not, and this is one of three books that can take you there.  To get acquainted with this excellent meditation method and for lots of inspiration to try it, start with "Wherever You Go, There You Are" by Jon Kabat-Zinn.  Then,  to learn more about just how to do it, move on to "Mindfulness in Plain English" by Henepola Gunaratana.  Now you're ready for the Big Leagues of Mindfulness - Larry Rosenberg's outstanding book, "Breath by Breath: the Liberating Practice of Insight Meditation".  He takes the potentially complex topic of how to do this meditation just as the Buddha taught it, and explains the entire Anapanasati (Mindfulness with Breathing) method in a way that Westerners can understand and relate to.  I've practiced Insight Meditation for more than a decade, and have accumulated a pretty good library of books on Buddhism and on Meditation.  Larry Rosenberg's book - which I've read and re-appreciated several times - is one of the last ones I'd be willing to part with+books

Very Out Of Date+N+While Avalon aka Windows Presentation Framework is still in beta, I had hoped that the code examples and references in this book would not be far out of date.  I am finding that they are dramatically out of date (writing this review 04/27/2006).  This is not to criticize the quality of the book or of the content; it appears to be well written.  However, it was written in September 2005, and there has been at least 3 new beta releases of the framework since then.  About 1/2 of the examples I have tried will not even compile, or have bad runtime errors.  The "big concepts" are mostly unchanged.  However, I cannot recommend this book to anyone.  Programmer to programmer, you will be better off reading examples from online sources like msdn.microsoft.com and downloading new WPF tools like "Expression".  This book will find you confused with broken examples fast.  I look forward to an updated version when Avalon solidifies+books
VERY INTERESTING FACTS!!!+P+As a business person, I found helpful and interesting facts on how to market financial products.  The topics are discussed in an organized manner and the book is relatively easy to follow.  There are separate chapters for each aspect of the marketing program.  Customer retention issues and regulations are also discussed in quite a bit of detail.+books
Kind of a disappointment . . .+N+This book, published originally in three installments, is regarded as a turning point in graphic fiction, like DARK KNIGHT and WATCHMEN, but I just don't see it. Generally speaking, I like Gaiman's story lines, but this time it's all just confusing. The title character, a crime fighter superhero trying to infiltrate a mob, is killed in the first few pages -- but there's more of her back in the greenhouse so all is not lost. Or something. A newly hatched flower-woman, who seems to share some of the dead one's memories, sets out to uncover her identity. I think. The mob is run by Lex Luthor (why?), who wants to capture her and/or her little sister (or whatever) for dissection. But Carl, just out of prison, who used to work for Luthor and who previously murdered his wife, upon whom the orchids were based, can't get his job back and wants to get even with everyone. This guy is a loser and screw-up -- but suddenly, in the last installment, the action having relocated to the Amazon Basin, he becomes a very talented and successful jungle killer. (How?) Other people from the back-story weave in and out of the plot, including one who became the Swamp Thing, but none of what they say or do makes much sense. And why does Batman get a cameo? (Not to mentioned assorted bad guys from Gotham?) McKean's artwork is interesting for its own sake, owing more to oil painting than the usual sort of airbrush work, but all in all, I have to give this a shrug+books
The Chocolate War -Parents Beware+N+I purchased this book because it was assigned as a part of a literature curriculum for 7th Grade. I am very glad that I read this book before allowing my 12 year old son to read it. This book is about gang violence (although it is initially sugar coated as being fairly harmless pranks assigned to frightened students by one of the gang leaders.)  The book is also about angry, jaded, hateful teachers and administrators in a religious school and how they allow the gang to function in order to serve their own purposes.   The ending has the one student who stood up against the gang being beaten up quite severely for his disobedience (while the administrator of the school looks on from a nearby hill.)   Before he is taken away in the ambulance, the student tries to tell his one and only friend to just do what the gang and the faculty want him to do.   The message here is do not buck the system, no matter how corrupt the system is. Within the first few pages the book refers to masturbation.  (Another re-curring topic.)  I knew that it was questionable whether or not I would allow my son to read this book.  I read the entire book myself hoping that there would be a redeming message in the end that would justify the rest of the book.  There isn't.   This is the first book that I have ever thrown away rather than passing on to someone else. Save your money.  I don't care how many awards this book received.  It is pure trash+books
A little disappointing+N+Finders Keepers, by Linnea Sinclair is another scifi/romance.  It's an action/adventure story with plenty of romance, but set in a science fiction setting.  Captain Elliot and her C-3PO-type droid, named Dezi, find a marooned and unconscious man on a desolate planet. But the rescued man, Rhis, isn't who he claims to be. And Captain Elliot soon finds herself in the middle of conspiracy and treachery. Elliot seems to trust Rhis even though he has lied to her, simply because she's attracted to him.   The technical jargon is a bit much, as are Sinclair's made up words and language.  This book might have been easier to read (and not as corny), if she had toned down the bizarre language with so many "z's" and "v's."  On the other hand, her descriptives regarding appearances were seriously lacking. There was an alien species, but I have no idea what they looked like.  And no one else, other than the two main characters, was described in any detail either.  Besides my criticisms, there was a good story underneath, though the ending seemed a bit abrupt+books
The Best Way to Greenlight your Project+P+In her book Web Thinking, successful Hollywood screenwriting consultant and author of numerous books on the entertainment industry, Dr. Linda Seger reveals the real secret to success in any job. She hits the nail on the head--it's about relationships. In my years as a performance improvement specialist to Fortune 100 corporations, 80% of success was not just showing up (like Woody Allen has said), nor is it technical competence and know-how (as our school systems wrongly assume), but rather the establishment of mutually beneficial relationships with our peers, our suppliers and our customers. People get jobs and lose them primarily because their egos are too big to help others succeed. Or as Seger puts it, we need to be "Connecting, Not Competing." Regardless, listen to the interviews with A-listers in any industry. More often it's not the project that creates the critical mass for a greenlight, but how much one person wants to work with another.   Linda's writing was very helpful in the writing of my own book on screenwriting published by Michael Wiese Productions: THE MORAL PREMISE: Harnessing Virtue and Vice for Box Office Success+books
A Quick Read if Nothing Else+N+When I first read the summary of Lost Souls I knew I had to get this book.  So, on what would end up being an long journey, I phoned my local second hand book stores and after going to three finally found one that actually had a copy (despite the others that were 'supposed to have one, miss, sorry').  I couldn't wait to read it, and in two days I'd finished the book.    Now, perhaps it was because my sights had been set so high, or perhaps I expected a well written novel when there was none, but 'Lost Souls' disappointed me severely.  As another reviewer said Nothing, the main character, is possibly one of the most selfish characters I've come across.  I'm fine with selfish characters, I myself loved Lestat of the Vampire Chronicles, but only when they're well written.  We're meant to sympathize with him but I found it impossible to do so.  He is honestly a selfish teenager and even while reading this when I was a teenager I wanted Nothing to come to some revelation.  I found the only character I felt bad for in the novel died early on.  While the rest of the novel was supposed to be tense, or possibly filled with horror, I found I was flipping through without a true care as to what happened to the main characters.  There were a few moments of suspense but nothing too frightful.  In all honesty, the book reminded me of the countless  horror stories that fill writing websites [...]   Overall, I would say it's worth a read if you've nothing else to do and are craving any type of vampire story.  Just don't expect too much+books
kabbalah+P+I learned a great deal from Herr Doktor Gershom Scholem (1897-1982) through his text, &quot;On the Kabbalah and Its Symbolism&quot;.  Dr Bernard McGinn, Divinity School, University of Chicago, wrote in the introduction, &quot;I believe that all students of mysticism should read Scholem, not only for his profound insights into the Jewish mystical tradition, but also to deepen their understanding of the dynamics of other mysticisms -- Christian, Islamic, and even those further afield.&quot;  Professor Scholem presents an historical perspective with the full knowledge that there are other approaches.  &quot;From an historical point of view&quot;, he writes, &quot;the sum of religious phenomena known as mysticism consists in the attempts of mystics to communicate their experiences to others.&quot;  Within this context, this text explores broad sweeping topics in each chapter -- topics that deservedly have receieved attention by intelligent scholars for centuries.  In the first chapter, &quot;Religious Authority and Mysticism&quot; Herr Doktor Scholem presents a thesis fundamental to his research, &quot;there is no mysticism as such, but only the mysticism of particular religious systems, Christian, Islamic and Jewish mysticism, and so on&quot;.  The mystic working within a religious system is, according to Scholem, at the same time both conservative and revolutionary.  &quot;Conservative&quot; because the mystic tries to preserve the sources of traditional authority, and &quot;revolutionary&quot; because the mystic also may subsititue his own opinion for that prescribed by authority.  In the second chapter, titled, &quot;The Meaning of the TORAH in Jewish Mysticism&quot;, Scholem explains the dynamic relationship between the TORAH and the mystic.  Scholem presents three fundamental principles on which the Kabbaslistic conceptions of the nature of the TORAH are based: (1) YWVH; (2) TORAH as oganism; (3) Infinite meaning of the divine word.  As an example of the third, in addition to the the concept of written and oral TORAHs, the author of the &quot;ZOHAR&quot; speculates four levels of meaning: (1) literal (2) hermeneutic (3) allegorical and (4) mystical.  The history of Judaism, Scholem explains in the third chapter, is a tension between the purity of the reality of GOD.  The dynamic involved is clearly presented in the realization that the price of GOD's purity is the loss of her living reality.  Scholem offers that the Book Bahir, a cornerstone of 12th century Kabbalistic thought, introduces myth into Judaism.  Remarkably, it contends evil as an attribute of GOD.  In a similar vein, the commentary on the Sefer Yetzirah by Judah ben Barzilai introduced speculative thinking to Jewish theosophy.  The fourth chapter, &quot;Tradition and New Creation in the Ritual of the Kabbalists&quot; presents a solution to a problem faced by each new generation.  Namely, how are the traditions passed on in a vital and meaningful medium.  The Mishnal codified Jewish religious law and ritual for an agrarian community had survived for centuries.  As the agrarian society diminished, the TORAH became obsolete and the natural rituals became less meaningful, historical rituals.  The Spanish Kabbalists found a new ritual to express the old traditions.  Scholem writes, &quot;The rejuvenation of religion repeatedly finds its expression in a return to ancient images and symbols, even when these are 'spiritualized' and transformed into speculative constructions.&quot;  R. Yanassan Gershom has already succinctly summarised the fifth chapter which deals with the concept of the Golem.  I will take the liberty to direct you to his comments.  If you are interested in historical issues of the Kabbalah, this is essential reading for you+books
Excellent Book---Highly Recommended+P+Though I have since made a career change, I realized, as I read this book for the umpteenth time a few weeks ago, it was one of the driving forces in my decision to become a counselor.  Many times I have seen in families, the battered women and children I've worked with and counseled, the need to love and be loved, to not be lonely. We are told that we will become more lovable as we choose the right clothes, perfume, shampoo, even toothpaste!  The list of products, guaranteeing that we will have would-be lovers banging at our door, that we will never be lonely as long as we buy these products is endless.  Our media-oriented society measures lovability by: popularity, sex-appeal, the right clothes and products.  Living by these standards alone makes us lonely, especially if we can't live up to them.  These standards are only masks, hiding us from not only our inner selves, but those of others as well.  Marie, the main character in the book "Daughter of Earth" struggles with her loneliness.  She wants what we all want - to be loved and not have to prove that we are adequate enough to be loved. "Marie lives out her whole life struggling to act as a whole person - to give and receive love in a relationship of equality - and to work against oppression - despite the image that inhabits her imagination."  From a very young age, Marie learned of the world's contradictions.  She learned how devalued women were, "that even male animals cost more than female animals and seemed more valuable; that male fowls cost more than females and were chosen with more care."  With the birth of her little brother, Marie realized how important a son was for there was much celebration as cigars and whiskey were passed around.  She also saw how the lives of those in poverty were worthless and that "the companies" these people worked for only cared about the profit they were making rather than the lives and safety of their employees.  "Coal was dear...life was cheap."  As Marie watched married women around her, she realized that the "love expressed in sex enslaves and humiliates" them.  "It is the toll men exact for giving economic protection to their wives.  The weeping of wives - what is more bitter?"  She sees women become powerless as wives and mothers and she in turn seeks a relationship that is equal in giving and receiving love.  She does not want to be like the women in her childhood that have lost the power to make their own choices.  In two relationships, Marie thinks she has found the equality she's been looking for. However, in the end it is not even so: "To her comes the memory of many women who have loved, suffered and remained true to the one man who did not love or remain true to them; to her comes the memory of a man who betrayed many good women for the sake of the one woman who detested and was cruel to him.  She thinks of the great loves that seem to have been great because they were hopeless; of the night that follows the day; of love and hate that are separated by less than a hair's breadth.  And she things of annihilation that irrevocably follows creation.  But above all, she see that she has had to pay with her life's love for the experience for which she was least responsible."  It was through a man named Sardarji, that Marie learned what it meant to love and be loved.  And through her experiences with him she learned that love means to get over who we are because of our culture, our values, or the decisions we make.  Through Sardarji, Marie "touched for the first time a movement of unwavering principle and beauty...and saw that difference of race, color and creed are as shadows on the face of a stream, each lending a beauty of its own; that subjection of any kind and in any place is beneath the dignity of man..."  Sardarji taught Marie that we can't live without loving all humankind; that we must do as Sardarji told Marie: "Make conviction the basis of our actions.  We must fight for what we believe in rather than fighting for something we know nothing about or for something we are told to fight for.  We must think about what it means to fight.  We must know what we are fighting for before we able to help and before we can enlist the help of others."  To break the vicious circle people get caught up in when they try to prove they are adequate to be loved takes knowledge.  For as Marie says to Sardarji, "knowledge without love is useless."  In order to love all humankind "we need to know how others suffer; and if we have already known, that we should not forget." To love without loneliness means that we need to "experience in our hearts again and again the suffering of the dispossessed."+books
A welcome return+P+When Michael Nyman first published this work in the 70s, it was the only book of its kind to discuss some of the most cutting-edge stuff going around.  Most musical texts avoided discussing the Fluxus group as &quot;music,&quot; but Nyman integrates these radicals easily, and provided the first discussion of the Scratch Orchestra (Cardew et al), and related topics.  The book still contains some of the clearest discussions of these topics around.  It's great to have it back in print, though too bad Nyman couldn't be bothered to provide updates on some of the folks discussed, like Hugh Skempton+books
A beautiful book+P+This set of articles, originally written for magazines and catlalogues, is one of the most eloquent collections of mountain writing I've yet come upon. The book is divided up into chapters such as 'Climbing with Style', which features articles about "the whole art of natural protection" written at the the start of the clean climbing revolution, and 'Further Aborad' which includes the authors account of a climb on Ama Dablam.  One of the features I most enoyed about the book was the introductions to various historical figures such as Smoke Blanchard and Royal Robbins. And the memoir style accounts of what it was like for a small band of climbers to live in the mountains away from civilization getting their kicks out of the "simple joys" and living in bare subsistence, long before climbing turned into the popular sport which it might be called today.  Doug Robinson is well qualified to write what he does, and his style is nice and clear without being base. Most of it is written in an autobiographical style, dealing with developments on the climbing and skiing scene for wenty odd years. If you are partial to a bit of Dharma Bums then get this book. Also anyone interested in the history of the Sierra Nevada+books
Another not very exciting Lt. Bak story...+N+I keep trying but cannot get interested in the stories by this author.  They seem to drag out with her style of "he said/she said" writing with nothing exciting, except perhaps one part in this book.  The story begins as the famous Lt. Bak is asked by his commander Thuty to investigate the disappearance of an explorer named Minnakht. His guide, Senna tells Bak of the disappearance and attraction to turquoise mines near the sea.  The land is hostile and murder and death come as Lt. Bak questions each man over and over. The ending was not exciting or unexpected. Lt. Bak's constant referrals to the donkeys (we know how he is sympathetic to animals, this big strong medjay!! I had to make myself sit and finish it.   +books
Excellent Read+P+Very interesting look at the the makeup of the New Hampshire primary and interesting facts and history+books
Burma Road -- History and Travel+P+A terrific book. Historical context mixed with current travel experiences in the region. This book provides a solid view of the Bushido culture which causes such a high death toll for POWs in Japanese camps. As this part of the world becomes more accessible, this is a must read for visitors to Myanmar who want some historical background+books
Short, Simple & Sweet Yet Power Packed with Life Changing Principles+P+I had heard of this book through someone else and wanted to read it because of the self-help quiz at the book's website.  However, when I got the chance to read it, I finished it almost in one sitting.  Like one of the other reviewers said, it reminds you of the basics and how the act of being nice to someone no matter what their station is in life can ultimately change your life.  What I like is that the book doesn't teach  you to fake being nice; it challenges you to actually be genuinely nice to others, often with no thought of gaining something in return. A simple principle but as its many examples illustrate, a powerful one that can impact your life in ways you'd never expect.+books
A great read for parent and child!+P+My son is 8 and although he is a great reader (has read all of the Harry Potter series more than once), he wanted me to read this one to him. I have to say we both enjoyed it equally. I would agree to a chapter or two every other night or so, but found myself agreeing to "just one more chapter" on a regular basis. It was nice to find something we both liked and looked forward to. What an imaginative tale. Now I need to get the rest of the series..+books
Beautiful and Brilliant+P+This collection of essays masterfully (or mistressfully?) weaves together autobiography, thealogy, feminist theory, and first-rate religious scholarship into an intoxicating blend that is at once moving and informative.  Christ raises many critical points that anyone doing contemporary theology (particularly Jewish or Christian) should seriously take under consideration.   I am an American male graduate student in philosophy of religion who is pretty familiar with writings in feminist theology/thealogy, and I must say that Christ's prose (in this book as well as her other work--"Rebirth of the Goddess" is my personal favorite) is some of the most lyrical and provocative stuff I have ever had the pleasure of reading.  This type of religious writing is just the breath of fresh air the often stagnant academy needs.  Taste and see for yourself+books
A GREAT BOOK!+P+I have been waiting days for this book, and it finally came today. Honestly, I expected it to have your standard sword exercises and cuts, but it contains stances and techniques that I have never even heard of, while some are familiar to me. Thanks to having a hardwood bokuto (which I also purchased off of this website), I can now incorporate new exercises into my practice. Even though Hatsumi-Sensei is a ninja, he is well-versed in the culture of the samurai and the sword as well. I recommend it to all aspiring swordsmen+books
A philosopher's view of science+N+In this book Popper presents two contradictory theses: (a) science can be based on deductive logic only, and there is no need for induction; (b) science cannot have a logical basis.   Because deduction yields sure knowledge if it is based on sure knowledge and induction always produces only hypothetical knowledge, as Bertrand Russell clearly stated, Popper begins by trying to show that the use of deduction instead of induction can provide a solid logical basis for science. He talks about replacing "inductivism" by "deductivism." In reality, he explains the use of deduction in the testing of a theory: consequences are deduced from the theory and are compared with known facts, which is something known by many. Induction, on the other hand, is used in creating hypotheses in both experimental and theoretical investigations and is again used in generalizing the results of tests (a) to all other possible tests in experimental investigation, and (b) also to some phenomena that cannot be used to test the theory created using the hypothesis, or hypotheses, that are produced inductively. When Popper claims that inductivism can be replaced by deductivism, he is unaware of the fact that induction is used at the beginning of both experimental and theoretical investigations to create hypotheses and again at the end of the investigation to generalize the test results.   But in the rest of the book, Popper concentrates on the generalization of test results, which is done through induction and is what he overlooked to begin with, as explained above. Consequently, Popper proves rightly that scientific knowledge cannot be produced using deductive logic, which is the opposite of what he tried to prove earlier.   The truth is that new knowledge is not a product of logic but is learned from the world about singular phenomena and is generalized through induction. Induction does not yield logically sure knowledge, but evolution created the human brain/mind so that it knows that it has to trust induction. Thus, everyone avoids hitting his or her head against hard objects by learning from past experience through induction. Someone who does not trust such inductive knowledge is punished severely. Similarly, when a scientist or an engineer does not use an accepted theory anywhere in his or her work, he or she is likely to be punished by failure and its consequences of many kinds.  Popper's views should serve to waken up those who seek the comfort of producing all knowledge through deduction only, but in fact, they shed doubt mostly on theories, because a theory is not deduced from anywhere, unlike empirical knowledge is, about some singular phenomena. A theory is constructed and tested by using induction or deduction, as necessary, at various stages of the total process on the basis of empirical knowledge. Popper's views are those of a philosopher who is not familiar with the mission and methods of science and thinks that science is about discovering something that can be called the absolute truth. Read also my evaluation of Kuhn's views.  Another erroneous idea of Popper is that theories can be falsified but cannot be verified. It is true that if a new theory is falsified by a few or even a single test, there is usually no more wish to keep testing it. But when an accepted theory is falsified by one phenomenon, it is not discarded as invalid. Its use continues where it gives good results. It is also true that a theory cannot be verified in an absolute sense, but this is true also about empirical knowledge. The generality of any knowledge is a consequence of induction which is forced upon the mind by the results of evolution, as mentioned. The verification of a theory, or any knowledge, means that it can be used where it gives useful results. Unfortunately, the impossibility of the logical or experimental validation of knowledge in a general way is seen as a weakness of only theories by those who ignore what a theory is and how it is constructed, tested, and used. +books
Challaging and deep reading+P+First of all, I would like to say in my behalf that I'm no logic expert, and that I had to cut Popper's book in chapter 8 just to read an introduction to Logic before I continue further in my personal experience with Popper. This book is a classical one, I had just seen references to it before, so I decided to give it a try. Boy, I was so out of my territory I felt really confused at times, but finally manage to get through the technical issues. This was a hard reading book for me, but I don't regret the month I devote to it, all the effort was worth it. So, why do I gave it four stars then? Well, just because it was hard, sorry, I don't have a better argument, but it's true, if you don't poses a solid background in Logic this would be a hard reading. I'm not going to talk much about this book content since I don't like that much, and everybody seems to do that, there's even some really good reviews in this page that make a better job that the one I could. Finally I will like to say that if you are interested in the philosophy behind scientific work, this is a wonderful book+books
Not one of her better ones...+N+I've been a fan of this series for years, but this one was really disappointing. One almost gets the impression that Braun herself has lost interest in the series...(IF she even writes the books anymore!?) Of course, the books have always been slow, but they did have a certain charm to them, making them the perfect bedtime material...but, boy, did I sleep well,when I was reading THIS one..+books
The one book I was told to read and actually did......+N+And wasn't it awful. Slow, nonsensical, not to mention boring....  Basically, it's about a poor guy who finds a black pearl. And then bad stuff happens. That is all the book is about. No sub-plot, no nothing. To be honest, the best bit was when the main character's baby gets shot and dies.  The book (about 70 pages long, to be honest I can't remember. I don't want to remember) is really slow to start with, and stays that way until the last 10 pages where a million things happen at once. It is way too descriptive, and nothing remotely interesting happens. And then it just ends. It was really empty.  I have read other "Classics" such as War of the Worlds, Animal Farm, Lord Of The Flies, etc, all of which had more substance and staying power than this. +books
Scholarly, Thorough, Thought Provoking+P+Hamlet's Mill: An Essay Investigating the Origins of Human Knowledge And It's Transmission Through Myth  GIORGIO de SANTILLANA & HERTHA von DECHEND  Hamlet's Mill is an amazing piece of macrocosmic literature that should be recognized as a true classic.   While some scholars and researchers may attempt to discredit this work as attempting to pull together unrelated mythology from distant times and cultures, this couldn't be farther from the truth. Nearly all religions are based upon two primary foundations, the first being astrotheology, the second being the use of entheogens; as above, so below.   While the stars in the sky may show differently at different locations, and the plants in a specific vicinity may be different, this does not negate the overall concept of the foundations being the same.   Santillana & Dechend have done a fantastic job at providing evidence that the knowledge of the Precession of the Equinoxes is far older than can be escaped, downplayed, or ignored.   The cultural myths, though slightly varying by time and distance have the same foundations, the same origins because they're based on the same concept...the stars and heavens...know the heavens or die... essential knowledge for planting, harvesting and storing food as well as for preparing for seasonal changes.   This is a most important book of many for understanding the ancient mysteries. Other books that will help the reader understand these concepts include John Allegro, Acharya S., Robert Hewitt Brown, Gordon Wasson, John Major Jenkins, Peter Lamborn Wilson, Jonathon Ott, Terence McKenna, G. Schiaparelli, Albert Hofmann, Richard Schultes, Christian Ratsch, Joseph Campbell, Manly P. Hall, Kersey Graves, Jordan Maxwell, Ernest Busenbark, Gerald Massey,  etc., to name a few.   One draw back to the book is that the authors skipped over the highly important microcosmic research of R. Gordon Wasson which was available at the time. A tying together of these two works (Hamlet's Mill and Soma), as Jenkins discovered (Maya Cosmogenesis 2012), can not be over looked and is a most rewarding discovery.   A solid 5 star work+books

A terrible follow up to Sticker Graphics 1+N+Don't get swindled by the packaging.  The graphical quality of the contents are suspect as a fair amount of the illustrations I can only describe as grade school crayon scribbles.

Neither Thrilling, nor Chilling. +N+I'm scared to death of aliens, and I love nothing more than a good campfire tale, so I was so excited when I found this book.  I expected it to be a collection of great, creepy, true-sounding stories, kind of like urban legends, that you could tell to a group of friends to keep them up at night.  Boy, was I wrong.  It's just a collection of short stories about aliens.  Most of them are more sci-fi like than scary.  I was expecting stories of the traditional "alien encounter" type, but that's not what's in here.  They're not horribly written, just not really what the book promises.    The shape of the book is great, though.  It's got a sturdy cover, and it's made sort of like a field guide.

should be titled " collecting American pocket watches"..+N+The book is well written, and is primarely about watches produced in the USA, and pocket watches at that.  There are a lot of illustrations, and describtions of most of the principles of the art of watchmaking+books
Diappointing+N+This is certainly an impassioned defence of beauty, and a 'feel-good' book, but it is so lacking in substance is barely counts as a contribution to the debate. It's incoherent at many levels, most notably concerning the switch from the accepted idea in part one that beauty is always particular, to the claims in part two that it is a function of certain qualities, especially symmetry. Asthetic symmetry promotes ethical justice? The idea of beauty as enlivening is also too simple. This is not good enough as a theory of the link between aesthetics and ethics. The account of the so called 'political complaints' against beauty is a set of caricatures. There is also a very weak accounts of Matisse, whose Nice paintings are regarded by Scarry as stand ins for real windows and real palm trees; some sense of what modernist art has done to the concept of beauty and why is needed here. There are many better books on the topic.+books
Brilliant+P+The Libertarian ideology and economic analysis is one of those things that is ruitinely ignored and was scorned in the 1970s and 1980s when economics was hijacked in the west by Communists.  However Libertarians have offered a radical alternative that has rung true from time to time and is an important critique that deserves to have more light shed on it.  This is a good beggining.  A fun and interesting history that is well written and informative that explains the nature and philosophy of Libertarianism and the people behind it.  Seth J. Frantzma+books
For Classroom use...perfect+P+I teach an 8th grade Language Arts Class in rural Washington State.  I found our textbook to be bland and typical.  I was looking for some work for my students to actually learn how to write poetry correctly. This book does this+books
A book of epic proportions - literally!+P+Reader beware - 800 plus pages, so this is no book for story time. Extremely prolific, James A. Michener writes as only he can write about the Caribbean, that vast expanse of ocean surrounded by Cuba, Puerto Rico and the extensive small islands smattered across the seascape. This is a powerful history of these islands, and James Michener takes us from the 1300s when a peaceful tribe of Arawaks are horribly destroyed all the way to Castro's Cuba. This is the sort of book one would do better learning about this area from, as the author weaves plot upon plot into a brilliantly masterminded historical novel. You will learn more from this book about the Caribbean Sea and its islands than any history or geography class could give you, and you will have more fun doing it! I gave it four stars simply because with a book this size, there was bound to be some dreadfully boring parts, and there were. If it were a bit shorter in length it would lack nothing but a Pulitzer+books
Not hippy new age philosophy taoism+N+For good and ill, I am one of the hippy westerners the book talks about.  The little I know of Taoism I know from a conversation with a friend and reading The Tao of Pooh.  I bought this book while trying to learn more.  The book is very up front about contradicting the seemingly widely held (western) view that Taoism is largely about attitude and how you live life.  This book is not about philosophy.  The book is concrete how-to advice about practicing Taoism in a traditional manner.  Different sections explain how to make your own altar and wand to use in rituals, why taoists should never participate in felatio, and introduce a whole pantheon of dieties to worship.  It would also make a much better source for a school report about a religion than a philosophy text would.  In general, I found the book interesting but not what I needed.    From the start, I was turned off by the tone of the book.  The introduction takes the attitude that new agers are messing up Taoism and people interested in it as a philosophy should get lost.  It makes some pretty broad declaratory statements about how all Taoists live their lives, and tries very hard to push a "one right way" to being a Taoist.  The book could easily be completely right, and I'm not an expert to say it isn't, but either it wasn't what I was looking for or Taoism isn't what I am looking for+books
Unkindness as Philosophy+N+THE FOUNTAINHEAD has been described by one of its many followers - yes, followers, not readers, for the book is essentially unreadable -- as a "passionate defense of individualism [that] presents an exalted view of man's creative potential."   This is a fair description, although it points unintentionally to the book's main flaw:  it is not a novel, but a tract posing as a novel.      Traditional progressive novels tend to be suspicious of the exalted, especially of those who occupy exalted positions based on birth or social class. In the case of Ms. Rand, the exalted are those rare individuals who, like herself, must be allowed to work their will upon the world because they believe themselves exalted.  A circular argument at best, a bad faith argument in truth, this tacit nod to the slow ascent of the common man and woman since the Enlightenment spares Ms. Rand from plumping for monarchy which, even by today's repellent neo-conservatives standards, is universally seen to be repellent.  Because her main character, Howard Roark, architect extraordinaire, is an argument and not recognizably a person, he not surprisingly suffers from a lack of inner-animation.  Sensitive readers will chafe against the underlying and predictable framework that ultimately treats characters as props for Ms. Rand's objectivist philosophy, an anti-progressive stew of prejudices posing as a critique of the welfare state and its "leveling effects."    Here's the problem with her "philosophy:"  for every Howard Roark it raises up as Hero, it writes off millions of people as unworthy of our interest, our sympathy and our compassion. Unkindness is not a philosophy most find acceptable.  With THE FOUNTAINHEAD, Rand attempted to make it so and has managed to fool many.  Because she has, she is therefore lauded by her conservative followers because her apologia absolves them of any responsibility for the fate of their fellow men and women.     Regrettably, this book and her other tendentious work, ATLAS SHRUGGED, have found their way into the backpacks of idealistic college students.  One suspects that many, because their relative youth causes them to see themselves as unique individuals, are seduced by the notion that they, too, are slated for Heroic status.  I have nothing against people having heroes; young people especially should have them.  But Howard Roark is no hero.  He's a stick figure that represents a hero.  I suspect too, that because of their general unreadability, students think the books are "deep."   In retrospect, it seems true that those people whom I knew in college who didn't finish this tract-posing-as-a-novel were people who tended to be relatively reasonable in their social and political views.  Those who did finish it, on the other hand, tended to be immoderate and dogmatic.   Judging by some of the reviews posted here,  this probably remains true today.+books
Endless Plotting+N+I'm a big fan of Shogun (4 1/2 stars) and Tai-Pan (4 stars) and expected much of the same here.  But after 450 pages I gave up.  Plot, subplot, sub-subplot, sub-sub-subplot, scores of characters.  I got tired of starting another chapter with a new plot angle, when I was ready for development and resolution of what came before.  This book picks up with the Straun/Brock rivalry from Tai-Pan after an interval of 120 years.  I wanted that history filled-in (including the remaining three coins), but there was little of that in what I read.   The writing is still good and I may have been impatient to quit after only a third of the book, but I had to move on to something more satisfying+books
SUPER FAST+P+I recieved the book faster than promised, in the exact condition listed. Thank you+books
Why rush in the queue for hell?+N+It seems extraordinary that a man who claims to write about the sixteenth century has omitted some of the key aspects of the period, such as the Crusades and The Norman Conquest.  This oversight is deeply criminal and  the book flounders for it+books
Irritable Diet+N+My wife an I bought the book and tried the diet.  We could not last the 2 weeks on phase 1.  Neither of us can stand the taste of fish, so our limited choices were limited even more.  The first week went okay, but by the second week, we noticed that we had become quite irritable.  We did not want to see another salad, cheese stick, chicken, or lean ground beef.  It was not so much that we craved breads, pastas, and candy.  We missed fruit.  Even though it would only be a few more days to reach phase 2, we decided to ignore this book and start with a diet based on the government guidelines (the "dreaded" low-fat, high-fiber, portion control diet).  In addition, we made exercise a part of our daily routine.  Our moods improved quickly,  Weight is coming off.  We are getting stronger and more fit.  It's been about a month since we quit South Beach and we are happy with our current diet and have no desire to dump it.  One thing South Beach did teach us was the importance of snacking.  It really helps with portion control and hunger issues.  Only, we changed it from cheese and nuts to no-fat yogurt, fruit, or veggies+books
Disappointed Golden Age fan+N+Giordano is a pro from way back in the day... he hasn't been able to adjust to the changing styles and this art book is a sad display of that fact. I recommend getting a straight art instruction book from Bridgman, Hogarth, or Loomis. This book shows his deplorable lack of anatomy knowledge (seemed to be mainstay back in the 50's a la Ditko & Kirby anatomy), his simplistic 3D construction, and overdrawn oval shaped good girls, etc. He also graduated from the Wally Wood school of art where if you didn't know how to render anatomy you blacked it out. Still, he was one of the prime lenders to the modern comic language, so I suppose this is some publisher's way of patting him on the head and saying thanks for the memories.  Don't expect to come away with any newer material already covered in "How to Draw Comics the Marvel Way" by Stan Lee and Buscema (very simplistic book but the comic dynamics are much better) or any new sensitivity to modern storytelling. This book CAN NOT prepare you for any MODERN styles. Ranks slightly better than a Christopher Hart book (need I say more...?)+books

Indispensable for Western gardeners+P+It's about time somebody published an inspiring photo driven book about western gardens.  The Sunset Western Garden Book may be the bible for western gardeners for its wealth of information but it does not serve to inspire the way a book full of real gardens can.  With more than 500 photos of western gardens this book should be destined to be a classic.  The great thing is that it is not just a beautifully designed,  coffee table type book.  The text is authoritative with dozens of full page charts and it seems to have been reviewed by a who's who of garden experts.  The author suggests plants from all over the world that are adapted to a summer-dry, Mediterranean climate and the photographer shows them in gardens not just close-up details.  Hooray for this book.  We western gardeners are too often frustrated by books and gardening advice originating from other regions.  This book is so beautiful it will frustrate gardeners in those other regions who will want what we now have+books

Criminal Mistranslation of "Boule de suif"+N+Boule de Suif is the story that made Maupassant famous, a story admired by his mentor Flaubert shortly before he died.  The translation in this volume has been in circulation since 1903. It is done by someone who does not know the French language at all and is full of astonishing howlers.  It is depressing to think that the English-speaking world has read this great story in such a dreadful translation for a century.  Some examples of the translator's incompetence:  "choqua" translated as "choked" (should be "shocked") "grouillaient" translated as "grumbled" (should be "swarmed") "interloque" translated as "interlocutor" (should be "struck dumb") "glissaient" translated as "glistened" (should be "slipped) "inattendue" translated as "unwitting" (should be "unexpected") "entre deux couplets" translated as "between the two rows of people" (should be "between verses") "grallait une pipe sur le siege" translated as "had a lighted pipe under the seat" (should be "smoked a pipe on the seat") "Il sont verts" translated as "he is very green" (should be "sour grapes") "par convenance" translated as "for convenience" (should be "out of propriety) "defiant" translated as "defiant" (should be "mistrustful") "propre" translated as "proper" (should be "clean") "malpropre" translated as "improper" (should be "dirty") "lapin" translated as "little wolf" (should be "rabbit") "le faisant s'interesser a des choses qui, vraiment, ne le regardaient guere" translated as "making themselves interested in things that, in truth, they would never think of noticing" (should be "making God interested in things that, in truth, were no concern of his") "ce ton... que les hommes poses emploient avec les filles" translated as "tone... after the manner of men having girls in their employ" (should be "the tone... that men of experience use with prostitutes")  The text is entirely denatured in this appalling anonymous translation, which should never have been distributed commercially.+books
Start with this book - it should be in every ER waiting room+P+Recently, my 31 year old, pregnant sister had an emergency c-section and then had complications that resulted in her suffering TWO strokes. Doctors would not tell us anything, no one could even tell us what they thought would happen with her. Luckily I found this book. This is a primer for strokes -- it gives everything from a lesson on how the brain works to how a rehabilitation program is put together, to how to cope emotionally as a caregiver. It is a quick read, chock full of substantial information, clear and well-written. You don't have to read straight through: it is well indexed and has a clear table of contents so you can get to the information you need most quickly. The most valuable part of the book is the glossary of terms that helps you navigate the medical-speak you are going to hear. Start with this book and you'll be equipped with solid information and understanding.  This book was a godsend in a time of crisis+books
Too advanced for beginners!+N+I found this book impossible to use! The photos and illustrations were so detailed, with lines traveling everywhere, that I couldn't transfer what I saw on the page to what I saw on my hand. I was disappointed+books
At least one 5-star review is an author+N+The turgid, confused prose is a dead give away. So is the overblown praise for this poorly written book. The 5 star review from &quot;the United States of America&quot; has to be one of the authors. If so, then the call  for &quot;objective&quot; reviews from a postmodernist is ironic, as well  as amusing. Also ironic is the book's theme of exploitation---by relying on  a dated, superficial review of scholarly research, as well as sleazy pop  culture, the book itself appears to be a work of Western exploitation.  Except this time, it's the arrogant academics exploiting prostitutes,  rather than their male customers. This harsh, intensely narcisistic  diatribe may be good vita fodder, but it is not worthwhile reading+books
Interesting+P+This book by Susan Mackey-Kallis provides an interesting approach to classic movies like Star Wars, The Natural, Lion King, 2001, etc. using a mythological perspective. The ideas of Joseph Campbell and Carl Jung are illustrated using examples from these films. I found the book to be very informative. A good read if you are at all interested in film or mythology. Another good book to check out by the same author is "Oliver Stone's America," which takes a similar approach to Stone's films.+books

Authentic, delicious Italian cooking+P+I love this cookbook! The recipes are very authentic and the variety is excellent. I make a recipe from this book at least once a week, and I've had the book for a year. I recently bought a copy for my mother-in-law. I've had people tell me that my food tastes better than something from an Italian restaurant. The recipes do involve a lot of cooking, since most of them use fresh herbs and vegetables. But the quality makes it worth the time! Happy cooking+books
The other side of silence...+N+I have read this book, Mr. Moon's &quot;Divide and Quit&quot;, Mr. Khosla's work, &quot;Stern Reckoning&quot; amongst others on the subject of the Partition. Ms. Butalia's work is so saturated with her personal opinions and idealogy, that it almost ceases to be a work on history than the airing of one's thoughts and mindset. Almost a diatribe, if I may. I will agree with what john_galt_who has written. I think he has hit the nail on the head. I did not consider this book worth either the money or the time+books
Certainly interesting adventures+N+This book is definately not as helpful as the first book.  In this book Brian takes the journey and metaphors a bit too far.  He strays a bit too far from the scriptures to make his point.  Keep to the first book definately more helpful+books
Profoundly Disappointed+N+I have heard a lot about Richard Matheson, and when I found out he'd written a survivalist fiction story (a favorite sub-genre of mine)I was elated to read it.  However, after a long arduous struggle to continue reading, I realized that disappointment and madness are quite connected.  "Hunted Past Reason" tells the story of two men: Doug and Bob.  Bob, a writer, wants to write a novel of backpacking.  Doug, the expert, is more than happy to teach him the tricks of the trade.  Right from the start, we are privy to the personality clash between the two.  Doug starts out as a "know it all" to Bob.  He tries to bludgeon Bob with his vast knowledge of the wilderness.   As the story progresses, we see Doug's jealousy of Bob's successful career and family life come to the surface.  I must admit that the subtle changes in Doug are blended very well into the story.  On the other hand, the story was dragged out far too long than necessary.  After philosophical discussions between the two (which are strained at best), we see Doug's deep seated sociopathic tendencies which erupt into a game of cat and mouse between the two.  After a graphic rape scene, Doug gives Bob a three hour head start and thus the story turns into "Deliverance" (as quite a few readers in this very forum have pointed out).  The writing seems to be quite repetitive.  The mental conversations between Bob and his subconscious provide for filler and are thinly veiled attempts at drawing the suspense out.  Being a fan of this type of subgenre of fiction, I was mildly entertained by the reading, however, I expected a bit more from Matheson (simply because of his fame and influence he's had on other writers ).  Maybe I was a bit unfair, but the other reviews tell me otherwise+books
A valid and persuasive discussion+P+Professor Eagleton takes no prisoners in this thorough albeit short critique on the theories of postmodernism. Focus is placed on postmodernism's general theories in relation to philosophy and political theory as opposed to postmodernism's contribution in the arts and architecture. This, in fact, could well be the subject of an entirely new book, however, aesthetics, in this case, is not Eagleton's main concern.   It probably should be stressed that a general knowledge of philosophy, postmodern theory and political science would be advantageous before cracking this text, however, someone with only a slight awareness of these subjects could push through the book (dictionary in hand) without too much difficulty.   By definition, post modernism is hard to define, as it claims no foundational tenets: it is more a method or perspective against established ideas in philosophy. As Eagleton writes, "It is animated by the critical spirit, and rarely brings to bear upon its own propositions." (P.26)    From a socio-political standpoint, postmodern theories are part of a culture of "unmaking". It can be characterized as a rejection of all "metanarratives" or "grandnarratives"; a protest of modernisms inclusion into the established order of the `canon', a snubbing of intellectual elites, a blurring between high and low art, where Bart Simpson sits comfortably with Shakespeare. I would characterize it as a cynical "anti" position on just about any idea that claims validity or application in society. The key principles of all postmodern theories include: "...decreation, disintergration, deconstruction, decentrement, displacement, difference, discontinuity, disappearance, demoralization and delegitimation." (Post Modern Theory, Best, Kellner, 1991)   In one respect, Eagleton applauds postmodernism's huge body of work over a short time, and its stubborn demystification of natural institutions and conventions, though, criticises its blatant lack of self-criticism and ability to offer any alternatives after its deconstruction of all other theories. There is a certain feeling of excitement and freedom after reading such postmodern luminaries as Derrida, Lyotard or Kristiva, but after wading through their dense and at times "cult-like" prose, one is left with the feeling of utter nihilism, realising that these theories are empty rhetoric, that over three thousand years of human progress was all a lie, a "grand-narrative" to keep us chained.   For the most part Eagleton criticises postmodern theory against the theories of Marxism and socialism, and does a remarkable job revealing postmodernism's na?ve, almost adolescent view of the present world situation.  He concludes that postmodern end-of-history thinking gives us no future other than the present. That there are many possible futures, including fascism: how would postmodern theory shape to such a future? In my opinion, not too well.  This book is a valid discussion and a persuasive argument on the many pitfalls of postmodern theory. +books

LOVE this book...am rereading for 10th time!!+P+Right now I'm rereading Karen Rose's Have  You Seen Her?  It's romantic suspense at it's best, with a dark overtone.  SBI agent Steven Thatcher (who was introduced in earlier books) is floundering.  He has a case that involves young teenage girls that go missing from their beds.  And they're turning up dead, and noone seems to know anything.  According to the feedback he's getting, these girls would never have willingly left their homes with anyone.  He's hitting a wall, and more girls are going missing...His home life is quickly spiralling out of his control, too...his 17 year old son is suddenly flunking classes in school, sullen and sneaky...his youngest son, who was kidnapped in a previous book, still won't sleep in his own bed and is just getting so he'll allow himself to be touched again...and Steven's Aunt is determined to fix him up with a woman.  In the midst of all this, Steven meets Jenna Marshall.  Dr. Jenna Marshall, actually~~his 17 yr. old son's Chemistry teacher, who is very concerned with Brads decline in grades and attitude.  The attraction is mutual, and immediate.  But how will Steven find the time for this when his plate is already full?  This is an awesome story, and if you're a romance fan, or a fan of suspense, don't miss it!!  It's loosely connected to Karen's other books, but every one is stand alone and not to be missed.  Her new book, Count To Ten is due out soon, and I can't wait!! +books

Dont waste your  kids' time!+N+I recently read this book for a ELAN class @ UGA. I thought it was terrible and pointless. The characters lack depth and the theme of the book is not developmentally appropriate for 7th or 8th graders. The book was around 100 pages and leaves the reader wishing he had done something better with his time. My professor scolded me for not wanting to read this book to my future classes. She claimed I was scared to read books to my kids. (I guess she is refering to the religious implications in the book) She is absolutely right. I am terrified to read bad books to my students.+books
A typical Star Trek book.+P+This can't really belong to TOS, as it's not actually that closely related to the original series. Following Spock as he tries to reconcile his human and Vulcan sides as he is posted for the first time to the Enterprise, the book also introduces us to a young Scotty in an entertaining side story. We  also meet Captain Pike (who might as well be Kirk from the way he behaves),  and the previous doctor, engineer and first officer. The plot goes that an  ancient (and missing) Vulcan gem, the largest in existence, has been found  on a primitive planet which the Enterprise happens to be visiting. After  retrieving it, however, mysterious murders start to happen on the  Enterprise, while Pike, on the planet's surface, becomes embroiled in a  missing person hunt for two young lovers who could have been kidnapped by  mutants. And then love blossoms between Spock and another Vulcan on the  ship... the ending rounds everything off nicely. This book isn't really  anything special, but it's quite entertaining for a Trek book+books
Are these reviewers as blind as Bobby Jobe?+N+I mean, come on. A blind golfer? I thought it was an intruiging premise, too, until I tried to hit balls with my eyes closed. I'm a 2-handicapper, and I was completely hapless. So forgive me if my suspension of disbelief came crashing down.   That said, Cullen writes a pleasant, if completely farfetched tale, with likeable characters. However, I thought the best parts of the book had nothing to do with golf. The subplot involving the mentally ill father was actually more interesting, believable and touching, and the best part of the book was a short bit about Allegheny men and their pickup trucks.  +books

Self-Loathing, Self-Doubt, How Can A Child Love Herself?+P+This was the first book I've read by Toni Morrison, and it did not disappoint. The story takes place in Ohio in the early 1940s - before the Civil Rights era, before Martin Luther King, Jr., and before Rosa Parks ever stayed seated on the bus. The story is told mainly from the focus from a young black girl about another young black in the neighborhood. The other black girl, Pecola Breedlove, comes from a family that is poor with a father who is an alcoholic. Pecola is considered ugly and her greatest wish is to have blue eyes, as she firmly believes this will make her beautiful.  Naturally, the story involves much more than this, and Toni Morrison weaves a story that catches the reader up from the very first words and doesn't release them until the final page is turned. Ultimately, the idea of self-loathing is plainly seen - not just within Pecola, but within an entire community, an entire race. Pecola's story is not a pleasant read, yet it is difficult not feel a tenderness for this child. She begs to be nurtured.  Many people who saw me reading this book told me it was a "black" book, but I disagree. The idea of self-loathing - either within oneself or within a community - is not specific to any one group of people, to my way of thinking. However, Toni Morrison has so captured the feelings and forced the reader to face them, that this book speaks to any and all who opens the pages. No child should be made to feel they are less simply because of who they are.   A very moving book, highly recommended.+books
Interesting but passionless+P+An interesting compilation of examples of the destruction multiculturalism has played on young minds, where a biased political agenda has replaced academics. My only real complaint is that the author - perhaps incorrectly  believing that objectivity precludes passion - suppressed her moral  outrage+books
456 pages of excellent storytelling +P+Taking history and melding it with fiction, and making it highly readable takes talent.  Everything is in this book.    Furst crosses 11 years (1934 to 1945), has characters move in and out of the narrative as well as have a panoramic/epic show going on at the same time, and never for a moment does the story seem thin--actually it's thick with thoughts, intentions, hopes and dreams of the characters, and their utter and dire knowledge that the whole of Europe is going to go right down the path of total destruction.  Also, I must mention the humor.  The chuckle is there, right after the sadness or the disaster.    Traveling from Bulgaria to Moscow, from Stalinist Russia to a Spain steeped in civil war, Furst offers Bolshevists, the NKVD, defenders of the Republic, partisans, and on and on.  There is common crime and the common war, political satire and the poignancy of a common death.    Reading Night Soldiers makes you want more.   +books
As a Certified Fixed Star Astrologer, this book is foundation material+P+I am one of a few Fixed Star astrologers in the world and no matter how much I read, study or research in this fascinating area, I will always come back to Ebertin's work. Though often his conclusions appear negative, if you will take them into the light of present life, you will understand how to derive the highest value for each star. For example when considering Algol, the star connected to beheadings, one can examine the aspects to this star and discover the person may have a tendency to lose their head in the aligned matters astrologically described. A star of extreme passion, Algol will also reflect the exact statements indicated by Ebertin - take Princess Diana's death or Nicole Simpson - both active under Algol at the time of their deaths.  I do not believe you can consider yourself knowledgable in fixed stars without this book. It is definitely one of the basic texts on the subject, others include the work of Robison, Guttman and of course recently Bernadette Brady.+books
A Disappointment+N+I couldn't finish this book and I'm not sure if the problem is in the writing or in the editing.  At times the author seems to take these great leaps based on one or two anecdotes from his life and it is just not convincing.  There are some interesting details here and there but for me, it was just too rambling and all over the map. +books
Don't read this without reading Matus+N+Irvin Matus wrote the definitively researched text on Shakespearean authorship  (Shakespeare, In Fact), and the Earl of Oxford fails completely as an alternative Bard.

It's the Wake Up Call+P+I have read nearly all of Mr. Walsch's books. The CwG series IS the world's wake up call. You must have an open mind to be able to see the true depth of this series. At one time, I used to believe as the naysayers. Then I started to wake up and truely see the illusion, for what it really is. People find that the hardest thing to accept is that what we truely believe in may not have been presented through the generations correctly. People have a hard time accepting that any belief, great or small, may not be totally correct. The closed minded will never see this. The wise and opened mined person will. I highly admire Mr. Walsch for revealing to the world, what he transscribed from his conversations with God. I truely and deeply believe what he has written. I believe because I can now see, for when before I could not. His works are far from rubbish. Most believe the Bible in it's present form must be accepted as is. I submit, where is the version of the Bible before it was ordered to be edited by Emperor Constitine in 325? Do you want the truth? Simply by learning to meditate on a daily basis, will allow everyone see that we are here to recreate ourselves anew in greatest version of the grandest vision of who we really are. ONLY IF you are truly honest with yourself and learn Meditation, you will then believe in these treasured works. I recommend "Spiritual Breakthrough" by John van Auken to learn meditation. It's the how to guide to reach the consciousness of God+books
NOT for an LIS student+N+ALthough this is text for an introductory course of management, this is inappropriate material for the novice or inexperienced potential manager.  Recommended only for people familiar with business-speak and several years in the field of management+books
Curriculum at its Best+P+I'm reading this book as part of English at my school, and I find it's absolutely brill! Allie's a real inspiration to me, as I'm planning to be an actress myself. And though Askew seems too dark for me, he's proven of great interest. We're even using Kit's style of writing from his story of Lak for future stories in the curriculum. We haven't read Part 3 yet, but when we do, I bet it's just as white-knuckling and full of suspense as the other two parts+books
A work for academic readers only+N+This book reads like a PhD dissertation and focuses on making reference after reference to dozens of other academic articles and books, much like a college research paper. I wonder if these 5 star reviews are from sociology professors because this is very dry reading and I can't imagine a casual reader being interested in reading this book at all+books
A fast paced look at downtown NYC post 9-11+P+I enjoyed this book.  A portrait of an actress trying to search for  her place in the world after witnessing the fall of the twin towers.  Great details for those familiar with the locations and people that make downtown New York its own universe.  Some names are changed to protect the innocent, but even if you have never ventured south of Times Square, I believe you will be able to enjoy these characters and their attempts to "make it".  A quick read (I finished this in one sitting and I am not a fast reader), fast paced, smart and funny.  I am looking forward to reading other books by this author+books
Boring+N+I had to read this book for school and i hated it. I thought it was really boring. There was not any action in the book. I would not recomend this book to anyone that I know+books
It is Horrible!+N+I can't believe how you nice little English people can actually edit such terrible and unbelievable books!  I hope you'll never ever get another book published+books
Habermas' Opus is Timely!+P+The German political and social philosopher Jurgen Habermas is heir to the semantically rich tradition of Frankfurt School thinkers. These men (and sadly, they are mainly men, although Hannah Arendt is in some sense in this circle) were seriously threatened by the collapse of the Weimar Republic. Their decision to go into exile in the United States should probably be controversial. Habermas is profoundly influenced by Marx, Weber, Freud, and Talcott Parsons, and wrote this book in the context of uprisings against the Viet Nam War. What we are seeing right now, Bush versus Gore in a contested election in which the very structure of the United States government is being questioned, could be illuminated by careful study of this book. I commend it to the attention of anyone who would better understand a moment in United States history which has been descibed as a constitutional crisis+books
He lost me with the personal attack+N+I personally believe Dr. Dyson has the best interest of black folk at heart. I really do. However, I think he is misguided and I am not impressed by him. I admit I did not finish the book. Once he began his personal attacks on Mr. Cosby I left it alone.   Bill said what many of us say in private. Period. You can argue that he picked the wrong time and place, but the message is the right one. Maybe he did not say it as nicely as he could have, but it is still the truth.   At the end of the day there are way too many writers and speakers trying to pass themselves off as leaders. Leaders lead, writers write, and speakers talk. The sad thing about it is so many of our people incorrectly accept these people as leaders. There are too many people trying to tell us what to think and not enough showing our people what to do. While Dyson beats Cosby down personally I ask what should some of these young brothers do to better their situation?   There are basically two kinds of people in this world. You either look for people and things that confirm what you think to be true. Or you look for people and things that will reveal the truth rather it confirms what you thought or turns it on its head. At this time our people need the truth, not more pandering.  +books
Disappointing+N+Some of the continuations of Andre Norton's worlds have been gems, and some of them have been disappointments.  Beast Master's Ark is the worst to date.  The original Beast Master was one of my favorite books, with Norton's classic complexity of phrase, her textured and troubled main character, and her believable yet alien world.  This sequel has simplistic language, startling to someone expecting Norton's turn of phrase, and no plot to speak of.  The story never generates tension, and there is no climax.  McConchie does a great job with characterization, but good characters are not enough.  There must be some story.  To add insult to injury, there are multiple typos, and some editing mistakes like tense switching that add to the general sense of a book that is not well written.  I am sorry that Andre Norton put her name to this one+books
the most romantic book of love poems ever written+P+perhaps this is the most romantic and most beautiful book of love poems ever written. every word, every stanza is so easily read, so quickly understood, like an arrow to the heard. give this gift to your lover and they will never forget it+books
Amazing!+P+This is the first art book I have purchased and I am glad to say it was a wonderful buy.  The Orientalists is a book full of astounding images and rich prose.   The author has written an art book anyone, including a lamen like me, can enjoy reading.  How many people actually read books on art, I would venture to guess that most would simply place a book of art on the coffee table and occasionaly glance at it.  However, I was unable to put this book down.  I found a greater satisfaction in reading Orientalists than reading most other books.    I learned so much about the rich history of this particular art and strongly reccomend any avid readers to buy this book.  You will not regret it!!!  +books
Great Communicator  who knew God+P+I would say that this is one of my favorite books. Tozer communicates in a way that makes you think. He knows how to make you get you thinking about your 'religious' ways and pursue the living God. This man can communicate in a way that is not over your head, but yet takes you deep. If you haven't read this book and would like to have a more intimate relationship with Him, this book is a very good place to start as it will direct you to the God of the Word+books
Lack of character+N+Although the book may be poetic and lyrically written, the superfluity of figurative language and abstract narration makes it difficult to extract the true meaning behind its short stories and anecdotes.  The lack of definitive characters, names, and personalities make it difficult to tell exactly what is going on and completely renders character development obsolete.  The book, although it addresses very real tensions on several factors, fails to drive home the significance of tribulations and common place yet serious issues that the migrant workers deal with because of it's occult language and stream of conscious stylistic writing.  If you can read Spanish, the original is far more impactful than the translated version, but still leaves the reader in an unsatisfied state of confusion as to what actually happened.  For those of you who do not care for stories without a story, this book is not for you+books
Best of the Best+P+Were you to read only one Wodehouse book (God forbid) which one might it be? I would suggest this one, although there are numerous contenders from the Jeeves, Drones, golf, Mr. Mulliner and Blandings stories, not to mention the one-offs and great unknowns.  Although this book has what might be called an overarching narrative, being that all the tales are told in the first person by one Bertie Wooster, the chapters nevertheless neatly fall out as short stories even if with somewhat "cliffhanger" endings, which is to say they don't resolve.  That almost perfect format will delight both short story fans and afficianados of the novel, and also spun off some of the best TV yarns in the Jeeves and Wooster and World of Wodehouse TV series.  My British edition (for copyright reasons not for sale in the U.S.) shows a cover photo op of Ian Carmichael as Wooster in the BBC series "The World of Wooster". As PGW noted, this was one of many instances where Bertie was overly mature and greyed; there seems a deliberate attempt to make Carmichael seem older-- whereas most readers, Wodehouse included, see him as somewhat youngish.   In Wodehouse Playhouse, which includes brief vignettes of PGW, he gives his imprimatur to the series for at least casting Bertie somewhat younger. Even better was the stellar performance in Jeeves and Wooster, in which "Pearls Mean Tears" "Comrade Bingo" and a number of these other chapters, expanded into episodes, appear. No wonder such a wonderful series was inspired by such a delightful read+books
Daring?  How about don't you dare buy this book!+N+Note: If I could give this 0 stars, I would  I picked up this book on the strength of the high recommendations listed here - I guess I should have looked at the fact that there were only (5) reviews.  This book was trite, un-even, and just plain ridiculous.  It started out with a decent enough premise but did nothing to really build the relationship between the hero and heroine.  Maggie came off as a young, naive, totally unrealistic, "I'm trying to be cute & pert" but, I'm not.  It's almost as if the character "Ally McBeal" were thrust into a book.  The plot veered off in directions that didn't get tied up and the Hero, Connor, seemed to be spouting lines because that's what he was supposed to say rather than what he felt.    Also, there wasn't too much of anything that was daring in this book.  Just Ugghhh!  I feel sad that I dared to buy this.  Just run the other way - get something by Gaelen Foley (The Duke) or Lisa Kleypas (Dreaming of You) instea+books
Great Topic - Terrible Presenation+N+Well, I just had to try another Dr. Phil book, since it has been a number of years since I read Life Strategies. To be honest, even though he can be a polarizing figure, I have nothing against him. I think his TV is a source of help and inspiration for thousands of people.  This book however, was a real struggle to complete. It was not coherently structured, and the author kept saying things like "This book will show you...." all the way through the book. It felt like I never left the "Introduction" and he was continually trying to convince me (or himself) that this book really would eventually get to the point and that the point would be profound. Instead it really couldn't ever get moving and instead often relied on crass language as a weak attempt to get the reader's attention.  Fret not! There are other books out there that tackle the same general issue, but are far better reads. I recommend:  1. Failing Forward, by John C. Maxwell 2. Today Matters, by John C. Maxwell  Again, I have no issue with the author, and applaud his efforts. However, in writing a review to my fellow Amazon customers, I must strongly recommend that you spend your time on more impactful literature within this genre. Best of success to you in reaching your goals+books
Too difficult to obtain these superfoods+N+I find that it wil not only be a big hassle, which is to be expected, but also expensive and too difficult to find these superfood+books
Dumb+N+This is one of the stupidest books I have ever read. The main character, "Fred" the mermaid, is a mass of neuroses. She's bitchy, snide and her responses to the most simple of events is weirdly inappropriate. In the very first scene, this 30 year old ph.D stumbles across her parents having sex and completely freaks out, so much so that she violently (but oh, so amusingly...) attacks them both. Time for little Fred to grow up, I think. The mystery is too easily solved and the men in her life, both instantly, and for no apparent reason, falling in love with her, are simple stereotypes of the gorgeous but smitten male. The first in a series, It seems likely that she'll soon be having a lot of sex with both of them; and simple, brainless pornography is about the best I can hope for from this ridiculous book+books
Buyer Beware+N+After reading this dull uninformative text, I no longer want to succeed. I just want my money back. There's a reason why many of Mr. Godin's books are currently out of print. Let's hope this one goes soon+books
Not worth the money+N+This book is only low to moderately useful to gamers that have been around for a while. If you are new to the game it may prove useful but the DMG has more than enough information as compared to this book. Cityscape provided better information and examples and led me to believe that this would be a quality product as well, I was wrong. If you are a collector or just have to have every book published by WoTC then I suggest you get it used and save a little money+books

extremely helpful+P+This book, of many that I have read, deals most concretely and clearly with the major texts of Judaism.  I consider it a must-read for all who are interested in learning more about the often obscure texts and their authors+books
A step back+N+I have been reading this book for a graduate level Art Education course.  In this book Kochman makes many broad generalizations that, while he may consider them true, are belied by the way he phrases them.  He makes many  absolute statements about the behaviors of both black people and white  people and the way in which he writes leaves no room for deviation.  I  would recommend this book if you are curious about why racism is still a  problem in this country.  The problem of racism will only begin to be  alleviated when people stop making broad statements that stereotype races  or cultures as behaving in a particular way.  Kochman does not seem to  realize this+books
A Great Book about a complete Fraud!+P+I've always had a thought about "REVERAND" Jackson, and this book proves it! Jesse jackson isn't black -  He's just a white man that's so full of s**t tha his body long ago lost the ability to absorb it+books
The Missing Element+N+An excellent and important story that needs to be told over and over again.  But for those of us who use non-fiction books such as this for research as well, this book lacks a crucial element--an index.  I could not recommend this book to someone researching information on the Holocaust because there is no way for someone to retrieve important information without laboriously searching page by page through the book.  When will publishers learn what researchers and librarians know, a non-fiction book without an index is not complete+books
Excellent book marred by slander+N+As many reviewers have commented, Prof. Lopez does an excellent job deconstructing the many fantasies Westerners entertain about Tibet. I was very dismayed, however, by his sneering dismissal of the work of Trungpa Rinpoche and Sogyal Rinpoche, who he declares are not &quot;real Tibetans&quot; because they dared to try to present a difficult terma text in a manner that they believed would resonate with Westerners. While Trunpa Rinpoche did often present the dharma in psychological terms, he consistently affirmed the conventional Tibetan understanding of the six realms and other teachings. Surely Prof. Lopez is aware of the years of vigorous traditional monastic training Rinpoche underwent as a tulku in pre-invasion Tibet, as a result of which he received both the Khenpo degree in religious and mundane studies and the Kyorpon degree in astrology. For Prof. Lopez to think that he is in a position to weigh in on the validity of the teaching choices made by these two lamas strikes me as quite arrogant and presumptuous+books
A Censored History of Latin Music+N+Many people who love Latin music and vintage Latin album graphics will snatch up this book.  Be forewarned that there are disappointments to be found inside.  The author/compiler seems to look down his nose at the garish, exotic, sexy and sensational album sleeves from the '40s and '50s that we gringos adore, choosing for the most part to showcase politically correct, bizarre abstract art creations from the 1970s.  No me gusta!  It's not that there are none of the earlier variety of album sleeve on display here, but there are not nearly enough.  What's worse, the author interprets "latin music" to mean Cuban, Brazilian and Puerto-Rican-derived product; if you're looking for reproductions of some great old ranchera, flamenco or merengue album sleeves, you're out of luck.  The richness and diversity of Latin music is missing from this book.  COCINANDO! is certainly a groundbreaking collection, but by no means is it definitive.  I hope someone follows up this incomplete history with another that presents the Golden Age of latin music from a more unbiased viewpoint.  I'd like to take the opportunity here to tout the collectability of vintage Mexican album sleeves; many of them are absolutely gorgeous, and they need to be recognized as the works of art that they are.+books

Save your money......+N+Bad, bad and bad. This book could have been condensed down to 5 chapters to tell the story.  It was dragged out for no other reason then to make it a full book.  I have enjoyed this authors other books, but this was was very disappointing.  Save your money on this one ladies+books
Fascinating+P+As a geography and history buff, I was fascinated by Marco Polo's journal of his travels. I followed his routes on my atlas and discovered that he did not always follow a west to east route, but rather zigzagged north to south to east as his interests changed. In India he narrates his fascination with the role of monkeys in society, the strange vestments and customs of the people there, so alien to anything he had ever seen or experienced. Then he spends years and years in the Orient, befriending the Chinese emperor, learns to speak Chinese to the point where he practically forgets his native Italian, even becomes governor of a Chinese state. From adolescence intoto adulthood, Marco travels with his father and uncle during 30 years, discovering the marvels of a world unknown to the west, by ship, elephant or camel, or on foot over some of the world's highest mountains, against all odds but driven forth by endless curiousity and optimism.+books

Is It Reality Or A Blend Of Reality And Fantasy?+P+I read this book thirty years ago(do you think I waited long enough to write this review?) and enjoyed it very much, but found it perplexing.  I, myself, am a yogi, but this story would strike most people as being a blend of truth and fantasy.  But what is wrong with that?  It is a beautiful story that teaches us many things about the way yogis look at life--and death.  Do not approach this book with a critical eye on truth.  Instead, think of it as a type of epic poem.  Reflect on the reality of it at your leasure!  One thing is true about this book:  the author wrote this book with great love of all humanity!  If you have developed an interest in some aspect of yoga and want to learn something more of what traditional yoga(as opposed to the "designer" versions touted lately) is about, give this a try+books
Excellent short review that is true to its title+P+This is an excellent short review of European quest for a language to unite its disparate nations with each other and the rest of the world. I thought that the book did an excellent job of staying on the subject and illustrating the progression of thought in this area. It does confine itself to Europe and time period as defined in the beginning of the book. That is excellent, there is simply no other way to cover as much ground as the book attempts to do, and I feel that it does suceed admirably. As usual, Eco's erudition and research are amazing. This book is published in the context of a European series of books about Europe and I wish there was a similar book series that would cover this ground for Far East and India as well. I am sure people there worked on the same kind of problems. Some of the problems with languages and methods described seem so obvious that one has to wonder what the authors themselves thought about them. Of course, this is a whole other book series. I wish there was a 4 1/2 rating as I do not think this is truly a masterpiece, but certainly a very very good book from a very very good author of fiction and non-fiction. A bonus for fans of Focault's Pendulum -- a lot of data in that fiction book refers to work discussed in this non-fiction work. Great fun+books
A favorite of this mom as a child+P+I still remember asking my dad to read this story to me every night when I was a child.  I am now a 31 year old mom of one son and I am looking forward to reading this to him night after night.  With wonderful  tongue-twisters and places to spark the imagination and the varieties of  eggs...Read it early and often+books
Bit off more than he could chew+N+I am a great fan of Saylor's historical novels, but was very disappointed by this one.  His skill has always been in creating completely believable environments, down to the smallest details, and placing his stories within those frameworks.  But the vast scope of this novel(?) makes that kind of meticulous detail impossible.  Everything, including the prose, in this book seems somehow pale and uninspired-- a writer biting off more than he can chew, or, to vary the image, spreading himself way too thin.  The book reminds me of James Michener's old pot-boiler, "The Source." Saylor at his best is one-hundred times the writer Michener was, but I enjoyed Michener's book more than Saylor's, which I simply could not finish.  Nothing about it engaged me+books
rate this book an  "...Incomplete Guide to the Classical..."+N+("COMPLETE"  guide to the classical"?...there's a WARNING WORD for you!)  Judging by the numerous 5 star ratings,  some people presume to learn from Robins' style of writing and illustrating an art instruction book.  Moreover,  Robins  subtitles the "Art of Figure Drawing" as : "THE COMPLETE GUIDE TO THE CLASSICAL TRADITION";   well, it isn't!   It is anything BUT a complete guide to the "classical tradition".  In fact,  it is exactly the opposite of the "classical tradition" for teaching drawing.      Before purchasing this book,  the reader should do a web-search for LUCA  CAMBIASO  (born  1527   died  1585).    Luca  Cambiaso,  Genoese painter    began using  simplified cubic shapes as a kind of shorthand drawing style,  and is believed to have been the author of  the method of dividing the human body into small squares in order to give correct proportions.      Art authorities believe that Rennaissance Masters passed  "pattern books" to their students for study.  Of these,  Luca Cambiaso's  drawings are about all that remain of these  "block figure"  rough sketches.  Some of these can be found on the internet,  just to give you an idea.         At any rate,  the point I am making here is that these "block figures"   [which Jack Hamm calls  SIMPLIFIED  FIGURETTES ]  are at the core of the   CLASSICAL  TRADITION.                     Robins fails to include  block figure, human puppet, or simplified figurette  drawings that must be part of a book referencing the "classic drawing techniques,"    because such block figures are much represented in books genuinely invested in "the classic tradition".             I do not really understand why,  but it is quite common today,  for authors NOT FOLLOWING the CLASSICAL   TRADITION  to claim exactly the opposite.  They claim to teach the CLASSICAL TRADITION, but they DO NOT?   To be blunt,  it's a rip-off of some kind.         Robins is entirely misleading in his title. Rather than being invested in "the classical tradition"    Robins is vested in the "contemporary perspectives" approach to figure drawing.    Classical Tradition per se,  is more represented in books by Walt Reed, or Jack Hamm  &    Edgar Loy Fankbonner  &   others where   BLOCK FIGURE or HUMAN PUPPET drawings, along with intermediate steps for refining rough sketches by degree, make up the real  "classical tradition".    (I know I'm being repetitive here,  but I simply insist on making the point!)        Another fundamental flaw in Robins method, is that he offers what one Amazon book reviewer has termed,  "Invisible Problem Solving,"  whereby the final drawings are shown, avoiding the beginning or intermediate steps which are used to arrive at final drawings.        The last MANGA drawing book I peeked at contained no less than 70 pages (out of a total of 190 pages)  on human...(HUMAN,  not CARTOON, mind you)  anatomy using a HONEGUMI skeleton for illustration.  This included basic instruction that any COMPLETE guide ought to have:  how to draw human eyes,  ears (from front and back view),  nose,  mouth,  musculature and bone structure.   In this regard,  the use of a basic anatomical device  such as a HONEGUMI skeleton or "simplified figurette" as Jack Hamm calls them,  is fundamental to basic drawing.  And this is my criticism of Clem Robins;  that he has titled his book  a "complete guide" but it certainly excludes beginning students as a target audience.         The price is too high,   when there are more thorough guides to human figure drawing still in print for less, some of them published over 50 years ago.  Mr. Robins himself recommends George Bridgman to the book buyer, over his own text, so what's the point anyway?  The point is,  that whether by  publisher or individual author,  the "how-to-draw" market is flooded with books that some will buy,  confident that they are acquiring the very best of the figure drawing tradition.  I would shrink from a purchase that contains an author's  personal  CAVEAT EMPTOR. +books
Great Technical Book+P+This book may not be suited for beginners.  It's a great addition to your arsenals if you are an advanced student majoring in Control systems or working in an industry with feedback control design emphasis. The added software is great for hands-on practical problem solving technique.+books
Flatland is boring+N+Flatland is for advanced students -seniors and up- who are participating in a physchological study class. This book warps your thinking about the geometric rules. Unfortunately, it is written in such a way that even if you are a very concentrated reader, you cannot read a paragraph withouth being distracted. The diction in this story is made to be boring. A teacher assigned freshmen students-in high school- to read this and everyone complained because it literally takes and hour to get through a couple of pages. You must also reread the text to find some sort of meaning. This book is not meant for anyone under 18 and is certainly not enjoyable for leisurely purposes+books
Not Worth Turning the First Page+N+This is one of those books where you actually feel embarrassment for the author.  The book is poorly researched, poorly written and, well, words just fail me.  While I am not a great Herriot fan, I do have to give him his due - the man could write well and could tell a good story (isn't that what authors are suppose to do?) but this guy Graham Lord, I suspect, has problems feeding paper into his typewriter!  The intire book is such an obvious ploy to make some money on the shirttail of a &quot;dead&quot; and popular author, it is rather nauseating.  Shame on the publisher for accepting such shoddy work!  I did finish the book though (thank God I did not purchase the thing) because each page became worse and worse and I could not stop, thinking with each turn of the page &quot;well it just cannot be any worse than that last page/chapter.&quot;  How wrong I was!  If you must read the thing, borrow it or check it out of a library.  I would hate to see a person waste their money, and I certainly would not want the author and his publisher to be rewarded for a work such as this.  Herriot's life, warts and all, could be such a fastinating subject.  I do hope someone will turn out a good study of him eventually.  We certainly did not get it here+books
Needed more suspense.+P+After Box's first three excellent books, I found this a bit lacking.  It felt very slow at times and had a number of things left unexplained.  I don't mind the element of mysticism but it didn't feel complete.  Joe, his family and friends are great characters, the story definitely had me turning the pages and completing it in a day but it wasn't quite as strong as his previous books.    Don't misunderstand; this is still a very good read and a series I shall continue to follow, but I hope the next entry will have a bit more suspense to it. +books
What Russian literaute ought to be+P+In a letter to the Fourth Congress of Soviet Writers Solzhenitsyn writes, "Lierature that is not the breath of contemporary society, that dares not transmit the pains and fears of that society, that does not warn in time against threatening moral and social dangers - such literature does not deserve the name of literature; it is only a façade." Cancer Ward is no façade.  A truly moving story of life and death, disease and recovery, Cancer Ward is a novel with impact. The characters are brilliantly portrayed and it is they who tell the story. From loyal party member Pavel Nikolayevich to labor camp survivor Oleg Kostoglotov and through all the characters whose lives fit somewhere in between, the virtues and faults of socialism are examined, dissected, and layed out clearly for the reader.  While his contemporaries were busy writing safe novels, novels which towed the party line and supported the prescribed views of Stalinism, Solzhenitsyn took a grave risk. He wrote novels which reflected truth. He wrote novels which portrayed the real life trials of the people. And, in the end, he wrote novels which were not published in the nation he so dearly loved.  Make no mistake. Alexander Solzhenitsyn was no rebel. He truly loved his country and supported his government. His use of brutally honest literature was meant to strengthen his beloved country. It was Solzhenitsyn's hope that by portraying the weaknesses of his country he might help eliminate some of those problems. Alas, his works were largely ignored due to the unrelenting censorship of the Soviet government.  Fortunately for the rest of the world his works were not lost. They found their way out of Russia and onto the stage of World Literature. For this we can all be thankful. Cancer Ward is an enriching novel and a worthy addition to anyone's library.  This is not a book you want to pass up+books
What a bore!+N+This book is such a drag- not for the math bit, but the non-mathematical sections. The stories and ramblings are absolutely unnecessary, and detract from the substance. The problem is that the stories are inextricably intertwined with the math, and quite impossible to skip if you don't want to  miss the math bit. To the extent I was able to drag on, the calculus portions seemed great, but it became too tiresome going through the flab. The great book on calculus has to be "How to enjoy Calculus" by Eli S. Pine- a book I regret not having known in my school days+books
An average read+N+An interesting story but only an average read. Jumping from one author to another is distracting. There are many other books written about women doing remarkable journeys that make a better read an deserve attention+books
Don't leave home without it+P+I have a GPS, I even have a Road Whiz which tells you where the next rest area is on most highways, etc.  But this book tells you EXACTLY what is at the next exit, amazingly accurate, and very easy to use, so much data it is unbelievable.  If you only use this once or twice a year you will be so glad you have it.  Buy it +books
Even economists smoke crack+N+This man lives in a world od distorted reality.  Economic equality and poverty is bound to exist reguardless of the mode of production.  Capitalism allows democracy, which is the most important issue to me.  He talks about Cuba in this book...  The have to give up freedom and live in poverty, but their literacy level is the same as our's; which system sounds better?  Tjis was a well written book wth ample information, so I probably should have rated it better.  However, I hate the message that it sends+books
National Geographic should be ashamed.+N+This slap dash compilation of short descriptions was probably put together as a quick way to make a few bucks. The authors are indeed esteemed but I bet each one wrote their part from memory on a Sunday afternoon. The battle descriptions are dry and confusing--most of the maps are useless in determining the sequence of events. Geography seems to be sort of thrown in as a catchy way to snare amateur buffs like myself. I usually read reviews before I buy a book and this time I just &quot;assumed&quot; good quality due to the National Geographic Society imprimatur. Stay away+books
nothing beautiful about it+N+I had such high hopes for this book - nominated for all those prizes!  If you're looking for gay fiction then this book is for you.  It should be sold with the porn magazines - the first 100 pages ramble on and on about gay sex - but never get to a storyline.  I tried to endure.  I kept hoping there was a story!  I grew up in Britain and thought this sounded like a great perspective on the Iron Lady (Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher) and 80's Britain.  But it's just about a guy trying to fit in with a bunch of snobbish upper class twits!  Oh yes, and there's lots of gay sex+books
The book was as empty as the chair.+N+New York criminalist, Lincoln Rhyme, is in North Carolina to undergo surgery which he hopes will improve his quadriplegia.  A sheriff from the small town of Tanners Corner asks for his help.  A teenaged boy has been murdered and two young women kidnapped by a youth known as Insect Boy.  Rhyme, along with his protagee' and soul mate Amelia Sachs and his aide Thom, agree to help.  This is the first book by Deaver I've read and, while I am hoping it was just a bad choice,  I'm not certain I'll read another.  I really struggled to get through it.  I had no history of the principal characters and none was given.  In fact, all the characters were one dimensional, there were two many of them and stereotypes ran rampant.  I like a good twist or two in a story but this became laughable.  And let's not even talk about the ending!   I did feel Deaver did a very good job conveying the problems and frustrations of a quadriplegic, but that was the only redeeming feature.  As for the plot, the title says it all.  This rated zero on the believability scale.  +books
Truly amazing+P+While at the MoMA I happened across the Chuck Close exhibit. I had heard of him, but had never seen his work. As I walked through the exhibit I thought to myself, &quot;big deal, a bunch of 9 foot tall photographs.&quot; But when I notice the medium was acrylic I was astonded! This book captures the unbelievable talent of this amazing artist. It shows his the vast array of materials he used from paint, to pieces of paper. i would highly recommend buying this book! It is one of my favorites+books
Very good+P+100% recomend to learn about spy histor+books
"Breathtaking By The HeartBeat!"+P+This book has fascinating events happening all the time. I couldn't even blink one second away from it. Even though this book was used for a project, it was far more for me than homework... This book really teaches true lessons that all of us, young the elders need to learn. Especially from Johnny Raven's point of view. The story plot was fascinating... how many times did i use that word..? Well it is truly is...+books
THE AWFULL MANGA CONTINUES...+N+The awfull book based on the game continues with a second book. I thought the first volume was rushed but this one takes the cake. I am now confused on what is going on, the story is even more rushed, there are many typos, and the story is not really connected to the plot. This book is more of a fan fiction than based on the game+books
Doesn't Bother With Context+N+The author like so many others lumped all Christian denominations and seeminingly monotheistic religions together as one. No, not all Christians are the same. Furthermore, the author took many verses in the Bible out of context, rather than choosing to see it as a whole, he instead sees it in pieces, as being contradictory, not bothering to take seriously WHY the Bible made certain statements+books
Off Centered Book+N+Love the beer but found the book to be more a rambling stream of consciousness that doesn't really have a point.  It really seems to be just Sam's rambling thoughts and recollections of his startup.  There are some great anecdotes woven through the book (and I'm sure he has plenty that aren't shared).  He goes over some of the many questions that any startup should answer but the business advice in the book is fairly basic.    At the end of the day I'm not sure what the point of the book really was supposed to be as several subjects are visited repeatedly.  It dosen't go into the brewing in any depth and there's certainly not enough substance to call it a business book.  If your a really huge fan of the beer you may have some interest+books
Long and boring+N+This book is long and boring account of an intelligence officer who served as director of mossad. I was expecting inside details of mossad operations instead author details how he personally contributed to some major breakthroughs in Middle East peace process. The account of details is ridden with narcissism and vanity. All in all not a good read+books
Get a Different Guide+N+I like Rick Steve, but he dropped the ball on this book.  Entries are confusing: he introduces a site, and then doesn't tell you how to get there.  The maps are terrible.  But the thing that really irked me was his section on driving in the Czech Republic.  He said that there were road "tolls" you could avoid by purchasing a sticker for your car.  That is just plain false.  There are no tolls at all.  If you do not purchase that sticker, the Czech cops will stop you and fine you anywhere from 500 to 15,000 Crowns.  1000 Crowns = about $45.  That's what our friendly Czech officer hit us with+books
Judson would be a demagogue, if he could get your attention.+N+I would have given this no stars if it were an option.   The first 20 pages of this book bored and insulted me. Judson drones on about every fraud known to mankind, but only occasionally scientific fraud. He seems to hope that if we hear enough examples of fraud in the world, we will get fired up and join him in a lynching.   His tone is condescending and assumes that you already agree with him. This is not the type of academician that you could hope to have a meaningful conversation with. He laces his information with references to "the epidemic" of fraud and nobody being "immune" to it, as if by the weight of these descriptive terms you will be swept into his inevitably correct conclusions. I suspect that Judson would have presented a more objective book if he had more worthwhile information to offer.+books
Belongs in everyone's library  YOUNG and OLD+P+I have to say this is the all time best children's book ever, full of love and humor. I remember reading this myself and have recently bought two copies of this book, one so i can read to my self and children the other as a keepsake.  I also have suggested this book to may other avid readers, young and old.  This is a must book for any reader and belongs on everyone shelf.+books
Review of &quot;Ten Days that Shook the World.&quot;+N+Although this book may be so brilliantly written by John Reed, I found it to be too laden with historical details, and even somewhat confusing for someone who is using this book to merely familiarize her (him)self with the makings of the Russian Revolution for the first time.  The book provides with a glossary of Russian terms, events and political parties necessary to understand it but even so I found myself hopelessly stumbling through the chapters trying to pick up information here and there.  However, due to my lack of knowledge of Russian history I was unable to piece together any of the information.  So, in frustration I gave up and relinquished the book to somebody who knows somebody who is a &quot;history buff&quot;.  From this experience I learned that if you want to familiarize yourself with a historical event about which you know truly nothing, it is always better to read a book which describes that event perhaps in a very broad outline form on the first page of the book.  The rest of the book should be written according to that outline. A glossary of main events would also be helpful.  On the other hand I do realize that most historical events are way too complicated to be approached in this manner.  Anyway, if you would like to expand your knowledge about the Russian Revolution, I highly recommend this book.  However, if like me you are looking to merely acquire a basic knowledge about this historical event you will get lost in its too many facts+books
A well researched overview of life in the early colonies.+P+This book is a well researched and organized overview of life in the early American colonies.  Taylor goes to great pains to supply insights into government and family matters of, and the trades and professions of 17th and 18th century settlers.  Intended as a sourcebook for writers, it is also a must for the history student who wishes to better understand American colonists+books
BOOK NOT PUBLISHED+N+THIS BOOK WAS PRE-ORDERED AND HAS NOT YET BEEN PUBLISHED, TO MY KNOWLEDGE.  YOU NEED TO CHECK YOUR COMPUTER+books
Not What I Expected+N+I ordered this book because I really like to cook and love legumes and my pressure cooker.  Perhaps I should have looked elsewhere.   The recipes in here are nicely put together with the nutrition information and there is quite a bit of information on legumes.  However, I found that there were too many Southwestern Chili type recipes for my taste.  If you like to make chili and lots of Mexican and Southwestern inspired dishes this might be the cookbook for you.  That is not to say that there aren't some Mediterranean and Caribbean inspired recipes but it just seems that the Tex-Mex and Southwestern flavors beat out the others.     Also, I happen to loathe margarine and avoid it at all costs.  I love to cook and would much rather use less butter or a combination of canola oil and butter or olive oil or even an olive oil spray -- anything but margarine.  Not only does this cookbook call for margarine specifically, but diet margarine.  In the same vein I understand that the author is an M.S., R.D. but I really don't think there is a need to use Fat-Free Dressing for everything.  I also didn't like that one of the recipes called for onion soup mix.  I have never purchased onion soup mix and try my best not to purchase lots of processed foods. Thus, I get very uneasy when a cookbook uses these types of ingredients.    One more irksome tidbit was the fact that there weren't any recipes or mention of other beans such as the anasazi, adzuki, flageolet, cranberry to name a few.  This cookbook might not be the best cookbook for someone looking for a wider repertoire of legume recipes than your Better Homes and Gardens Cookbook can offer+books

Overrated Nonsense+N+Living near McCarter Theater in Princeton my AP English class got to go see a production of this play while it was still being work-shopped for Broadway. Afterwards, my teacher asked what we all thought, of course first stating that she loved it so that all of the "favorite" students knew which opinion to take. They all raised their hands and said they loved it to, however, no one could say why.  Why not?  Because everyone hated it. I was the first to open the flood gate. "I thought it was ridiculous.  It has no real substance to the plot." "That's because the language is the point" "Well the language is the worst part.  Why would poor factory workers speak in absurdly flowery metaphors?  Especially ones that stupid ('Does the bicicle miss the boy?')?" My teacher flipped out at this. "You don't understand!  That's what literature is all about!  Metaphors!" The woman, asides from being a gigantic b**ch, was merely blinded by what reviews had told her to think and by her crush on Jimmy Smitts. A month later, the New York Times, reviewed the play after its Broadway premiere.  They said pretty much exactly what I thought.  I was going to bring the review into class, but why bother?  The woman already hated me.  PS. One earlier reviewer discussed how it was impossible to determine from the production the the daughter was raped.  During a Q&A afterwards, Emily Mann stated that they were having problems deciding how to show this.  I agree with the reviewer that they clearly didn't come to a good solution+books
Simple+P+So not only is this a great play by Shakespeare but it's also an easy version to read right along side the original text. No need to get out the old dictionary for those words that you stumble across trying to guess the actual meaning of because it's right there next to you. This doesn't take away from the play at all either. Speaking of the play, this is a wonderful romance that reminds us how naive people can be if they aren't exposed to all of the harsh realities of life. The lady in this play practically falls in love with the first man she lays eyes on that she hasn't grown up with! It may have something to do with the magic that her father possesses. Better yet, it has everything to do with her father and the spirits that are under his spell. After you're done with the book, try to find a live performance of this play+books
Not it.+N+I thought I had found the secret to making delicious artisan sourdough bread. I made the starter using grapes but sadly the bread was not up to my expectations.

I have tried Ed Wood's book and starters, the special Baparoma steam pan, etc. but am still searching for the perfect bread+books

Disjointed Narrative +N+I had originally seen this book as a subject of PBS' Frontline several months ago. I was enthralled by the subject matter and decided to get a copy from the local library and read about it myself. What a mistake. The PBS Frontline TV program was so much better than the book. I found Maraniss'  switch from the Viet Nam story to the University of Wisconsin protest story very aggravating; and, as another reader mention, it made for a very disjointed narrative. The juxtapositioning of the two narratives does not work!  I found myself more interested in the war portion of the book than reading about Soglin and his friends embroiled in a protest against Dow Chemical. Frankly, I found this portion of the book to be quite a bore and it almost ruined the book for me. Who cares about college kids and their protesting episodes. It is simply not important.   If you are interested in reading the book, read the Nam portion and skip the protest chapters. Better yet, catch the Frontline episode and skip the book completely.+books
A Delight+P+The names Ty Cobb, Babe Ruth and Honus Wagner don't resonate as much as they used to.  As the decades go by even the old-timers among us haven't been around long enough to remember them.  They've pretty much become historical, iconic figures, like the stoic-looking George Washington on a dollar bill.  It's a bit of a sad reminder of the inexorable march of time, but what a great relief to know that this treasure chest of a book is around to keep their memories alive.    The author got the idea for it in 1961 when he read that Ty Cobb had died.  Realizing that many of Cobb's contemporaries would soon suffer the same fate, he set out to meet as many of them as he could and record--literally with a tape recorder--their stories for posterity.  Twenty six of them are recounted here.  Some of these guys are hall-of-famers, some of them not even close, but all of them--every single one--had a load of interesting tidbits to share.  Baseball was a different game back then.  America was a different place.    The first great thing about the book is that you get at least several takes on the great ballplayers.  One of the fellows, for example, playing Detroit, talked about being a little nervous about Cobb, whom they had all heard would sharpen his spikes.  A Detroit player, however, mentioned that Cobb never sharpened his spikes.  Not that they didn't discourage the other team from thinking so.      Walter Johnson had an arm like a bullwhip, but he was a nice enough guy and a friend of Sam Crawford.  Late in the game, if his team was ahead by enough runs, he'd toss a meatball in to Crawford and let him belt it.  He never did that for Cobb, though, who he hated.  Cobb could never figure out why Crawford was able to hit him.    Honus Wagner is recalled by many as the best of all of them, with great quickness, great hitting and great fielding.  A couple of the fellows recall that you could usually count on bits of gravel to be flung at you along with the ball he had just scooped up.  Tommy Leach described him as the best fielding third-baseman, shortstop, first-baseman and outfielder in the league--he played all of them--and since he won the batting title eight times between 1900 and 1911 you couldn't really argue that he wasn't the best hitter in the league, either.    For some odd reason, there aren't that many memorable gems about the great Babe Ruth, although there are at least a few.  Harry Hooper (a guy I'd never heard of and a hall-of-famer) remembers Ruth in the first year he came up with Boston as a, "big, overgrown, green pea."  "Nineteen years old, poorly educated, only lightly brushed by the social veneer we call civilization, he was gradually transformed into the idol of American youth and the symbol of baseball the world over . . . If somebody had predicted that back on the Boston Red Sox in 1914, he would have been thrown into the lunatic asylum."  Along with these detailed sketches, including a ton of characters I haven't even mentioned--Germany Schaeffer, Rube Waddell (who didn't like to wear underwear), Lefty O'Doul, Dazzy Vance--the book is also, naturally, loaded with baseball anecdotes.  Some of the more famous plays of the time, for example, are recounted in different ways and with different perceptions.    Take the "Bonehead" Merkle play.  For those of you who don't know, what happened was this.  The Giants were tied with the Cubs for first place with one week to go in the season.  In a game against each other, in the bottom of the ninth of a 1-1 game, the Giants had men on first and third with two outs.  Merkle was on first.  Birdwell hit a single to center, McCormack scored from third, and Merkle . . . ran to the clubhouse.  Without touching second.  The Cubs retrieved the ball from center field, Evers tagged second, and the run didn't count.  Because of the crowd on the field the game had to be replayed on a later date.  The Giants lost it, and lost the pennant.  From then on and forever more, Fred Merkle became "Bonehead" Merkle.      But it's actually a little more complicated than that.  For one thing, Merkle was only nineteen.  It was the first game he'd ever started for the Giants.  And running into the clubhouse when the game was over was something all the guys did--whether touching second was necessary or not--because of the crowd pouring onto the field after the ushers opened the gates at the end of the game.  The players ran off to get away from them.  And Evers never did tag second base with the ball that was hit out to center because someone had heaved it into the left field stands.  Fred Snodgrass doesn't think he ever tagged second with any ball at all.  The umpires weren't around to know this, though;  they had already left the field!  Funny how the mists of history tend to simplify things.  The detail in this book brings these stories back to life.  And there are a ton of them recounted.    Along with all of this baseball lore, you get a pretty good glimpse of America a hundred years ago, too.  People were more humble, but in general confident, and much more direct.  It's fascinating just to consider their nicknames:  "Wee Willie" was the nickname for a short guy, "Specs" was the guy who wore glasses, "Chief," (at least two of them) were American Indians, and, "Dummy" was the guy who was deaf and dumb.  Nobody meant anything by it;  nobody apparently took offense.  Stuff like these speaks volumes.        Here's Jimmy Austin:  " . . . they didn't have clubhouses in most parks, especially not for the visiting team.  We'd get into uniform at the hotel and ride out to the ball park in a bus drawn by four horses.  They used to call it a tally-ho in those days.  We'd sit on seats along the sides and ride, in uniform, to the ballpark and back.  "That ride was always a lot of fun.  Kids running alongside as we went past, and rotten tomatoes once in a while.  Always lots of excitement when the ball club rode by, you know."    Yep.  Thanks in part to this book, we know all right.+books
Violates the False Claims Act+N+Wow. I was shocked. Legitimate statements of liberal Christianity include ones like, 'Transubstantiation is mistaken', 'The Vatican does not have a direct pipeline to God', 'Homosexuality is not a sin', 'Condoms and birth control are morally defensible', NOT 'Jesus never performed miracles', 'The trinity does not exist', 'Jesus is not the Son of God.' It is disingenuous for Spong to assert he is a Christian when he disavows ALL the major tenets of the religion - virgin birth, miracles, incarnation, atonement, resurrection, ascension, the trinity, and the deity of Jesus. He believes less in a religion per se and more in a code of ethical conduct like, say, Confucianism, and the "patronizing nonsense" (a la C.S. Lewis) that Jesus was simply a great moral teacher. He even says on page 229, "...a religionless Christianity must be born." Religionless Christianty?! That's a contradiction in terms. Mr. Spong sounds like an ethicist, not a religionist. He also owes Saint Paul an apology for rumor-mongering when the man has long been absent and not around to defend himself.  I do admit though, I liked a lot his discourse on the plight of women and mens' subconscious fear of them. I also liked his observations on homosexuality. What he had to say about Judas was also interesting (but misleading as it is based solely on his own suppositions, not evidence). The section on anti-semitism was informative but that whole subject has always struck me as odd to begin with, i.e., that a Christian could hate or resent a Jew. Very odd.  I'm sure we've all noticed that bible-interpetation discussions are on the same road as capital punishment, birth control, gun control, and abortion: I'm Right and You're Wrong Avenue. Especially with bible interpretation, words and phraseology are open to diverse translations, and theologians themselves disagree.  Oh, and here's my two cents on the Council of Nicea. Of course the Christian theologians had to discuss Christian doctrine and record it for posterity. Of course Christianity had to be, dare I say, 'corporatized' in a way. How can the Word spread without an efficient distribution channel? The remarkable thing is that it did not happen much sooner. You see now, though, how it is very easy for anyone with an advanced intellect (such as Spong) to take the very (true) words I have just said in this paragraph and make it sound convincingly like, "You see!..he admits it..corporatized!..distribution channels!..surely there was wheeling and dealing...these people were not serious...blah blah blah."  I offer one piece of advice. However, I admit I base this advice on my belief that: 1) An all-loving God exists, 2) the gospels are historically accurate, 3) Jesus is the incarnated Son of God and 4) the bible is divinely inspired. Whenever a bible passage irks you, enrages you, or just generally creates any type of irritation in you, remember that YOU are the one thinking about it. And you're not God.   +books

Tongue Tied+N+Deaver's skill at weaving a crafty and intriguing suspense story is sound.  He has the bare bones of the work down to a science, and when it comes to most of his tales, the bones themselves are strong, hearty, and glistening white.  In this case, however, those bones have virtually no muscle.  This tale is about Tate Collier, his ex, Bett, and their kidnapped child, Megan.  The villian for this tale, a slick-tongued psychiatrist named Aaron Matthews, is a man of such skill that he can talk virtually anyone into anything, a talent that rivals that of our protagonist, Tate, a lawyer who once wielded the same verbal weapons in the courtroom.  As I said, the story itself has some intriguing twists and turns, as all suspense tales should, and it offers up satisfying obstacles and the usual mysteries, but they fall flat for a number of reasons.  1.  When the crux of your tale lies on creating characters of uncanny persuasive abilities, the heart of your novel must lie within the dialogue those characters utilize.  In this case, neither Matthews or Collier ever speak convincingly enough, in my opinion, to warrant their being labelled as men who "speak in tongues."  And although a lot of interpretation must be allowed for the written medium, it still doesn't seem like Matthews' talent for conniving others is as plausible as the novel would like it to be.  2.  The book falls prey to a pretty major pitfall for literature of this type, and that is over-elaborate explanations for key motives and behavoirs.  We even get treated to a cliched moment of having the bad guy reveal his whole plot to the good guys before actually going through with the plot.  3.  Implausibility.  There are some areas of the book that are downright laughable, aside from the already mentioned superhuman talent at persuasiveness some of the characters possess.  4.  My biggest pet peeve: Deaver cannot write dialogue for teenagers.  In an attempt at creating authenticity, Deaver peppers their dialogue with an abundance of "like"s and "way lame"s so that they sound like rejects from some B-grade rip-off of a Dazed and Confused remake.  I understand that kids still occasionally talk like this, but Deaver's use of these trite bits of characterization is so liberal it becomes intrusive and annoying and ludicrous.  If you want to try Deaver, check out The Devil's Teardrop or the Bone Collector.  This is not worth the effort+books
Overrated book by overrated Genius+N+This book is highly overrated. I am sure I will get blown away for saying this but it has nothing to do with my appreciation of modern writing. I enjoy Joyce, and many avant garde writers. Stein has an ego as big as a house. Witness her constant comments about herself as a genius in the Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas. The literary equivalent of Picasso she is not.  The book is slow and boring, filled with failed, in my opinion, rhetorical tricks. If you want stream of consciousness avant garde writing there are many better writers, Joyce being the best.  Jack Kerouac is a newer author who is great also. I found it difficult to finish this book.  It did not keep my attention. I basically find all the praise for her as both a writer and an individual vastly out of proportion to her talent. It would be helpful if those writers and academicians who are full of praise for her would perhaps write some articles that are readable saying exactly why she is a genius.+books
Really just fantasic!+P+When I first saw this book in the bookstore, I debated about getting it for about a month. The moment I bought, I regretted it. This book was so fanastic, you shouldn't hesitate! The back cover makes the book sound stupid, and the front cover art is slightly freaky, but the book itself was actually really, really good. Masterful writing combined with poetic development of characters and setting makes the novel flow. The transtitions and changes that the main characters have to go through, the challenges they face, and the triumphs and discoveries that they encounter will have you devouring the book in a day or less. Honeslty, don't hesitate when thinking about buying this book. It will become a treasured piece of your collection+books
A book of facts and not guess work+P+George Catlin is certainly a man to admire, as is this book.Catlin lived amongst the Native Americans for many years and writes carefully of his experiences.This is an interesting read and provides another dimension to the subject of American Indians.The book is fascinating in as much as  Catlin portrays himself as a wordly man and a friend of the Indians ( And  he certainly was)but despite that you can still find evidence of his  ignorance within the text.Nevertheless he was a fascinating man who had a  fascinating life,his artwork allthough basic in my mind, is well worth a  look.My only critiscm of this book is that quite some time is spent  describing the scenery whereas I would have prefered even more writing on  the Indians themselves,that is my personal viewpoint, others may find that  intruiging.The book is full of facts and personal experiences and that in  itself adds to the validity of this book as musthave for your collectio+books
A profile in courage+N+You gotta love a political pundit like Joe Klein.  He didn't even have the decency to attach his name to his book.  Wow, that's courage.  That's a backbone.

Frankly I am surprised you have the courage to attach your name to your columns.+books
A plot that gets lost more than once. +N+I really tried to enjoy this book but just couldn't manage to like it by the last page. This story tried to explore the different aspects of family and self, all through the magical Lazelle family. I found it to be simple minded and rambling. I'm not even sure the author was 100% where she was going in this book.   The main character, Gypsum, receives her powers later in life than her family. She was previously cast as the "normal" one, alienated for her differences but attached to her family through tradition and magic. Her relationships with her family are forced and just seem wierd at times. Not once does the author explain how this family fits in with society. Most of the story runs like this: "I almost killed my aunt through cursing a computer that took over our minds. I need a cup of coffee" The author gets lost more than once in direction and the middle of the book is just another magical mistake after another where a point is made then skipped over.   Everything is so strained and just plain wierd that I couldn't get into it. There is no personality in any of the characters. If it weren't for the adult situations and language I would have pegged this as a young adult novel. I think it almost was supposed to be until 3/4 of the way through the book where all of a sudden a lot of the characters are swearing and there is a slight homosexual relationship explored.   I gave it two stars for some interesting parts of the book that kept me from throwing it away and the fact that there is some effort to include statements about family ties. Blah. +books
strong family drama +P+In England though she recently broke up with her boyfriend, seventeen-year-old Charlotte feels good about herself and her future as she is doing well in school, lives in a relatively happy all female home, and seems adjusted.  That is until she learns she is pregnant.  Her mom Karen is a teacher's aide struggling with her mother Nan's mind slowly slipping away with the demands from that side already overwhelming. Her patience is over the edge when Charlotte informs her she is pregnant.  Upset and unable to contain her anger, Karen cannot believe that history has repeated itself because when she was sixteen she gave birth to Karen.  Though she loves her daughter all her dreams died with her birth.  She did marry the father but thankfully divorced that loser soon afterward.  As Nan drifts deeper into the past including insisting that she adopted Karen, the mentally exhausted sandwich generation is not sure what to do as Charlotte decides to give birth except to flee in search of her biological mother dreaming of a loving comforting welcome.  This fascinating character study is at its best when the audience sees deep inside the three generations with deep understanding of being an unwed mother, a child having a child, the sandwich generation, and the creeping of dementia (as well as a late stroke).  When the tale spins off into the biological mother twist it loses some of its depth until Karen returns to her "real" family.  Somewhat a soap opera, THE BAD MOTHER'S HANDBOOK is a strong family drama that focuses on the demands and responsibilities on women without men.  Harriet Klausner+books
Good Advice to Be Sure...+N+The advice Rand gives writers in this transcription of a series of living room lectures is sound in places: anchor your abstractions in the concrete; remember that art is selectivity; show, don't tell; use actions to illuminate your character, etc, etc, etc. All good advice, to be sure, but to say that Rand is proposing anything new or different from what is taught in writing seminars across the country is a little disingenuous. Add to this her refusal to praise the work of any author besides herself and Victor Hugo, her casual dismissal of prominent writers without convincing evidence (and, even more interesting, the relative paucity of authors she even brings up) and a few didactic guidelines (her ban on profanity, slang, and references less than one century old), and there's rather too much extraneous stuff here to be worth the effort of wading in to try to get to the good bits.  If it's advice you're looking for, there's an excellent essay called "Dogma" in "The Writing Life," a collection of essays and interviews with a number of authors put together by the National Book Award that I found both more helpful and less self-absorbed+books
Good guide for dealing with common problem behaviors+P+This is a clear, well written guide to dealing with behaviors every parent faces. It offers sound advice on how to deal with behaviors from whining to bullying and when to seek professional help. Advice is presented well with main points highlighted and clear examples of how to apply the advice. It was extremely well laid out and easy to read. I particularly enjoyed the information on causes of behaviors as well as dealing with them. By the end of the book, parents have a clear idea of how to figure out what is causing a behavior and have some suggestions on how to change or eliminate the behavior+books
In Country+N+In Country, how can I describe this book? In four words crappy piece of garbage; am so unfortunably forced to read this literature for school, and i've got too say, to give it two thumbs up you'll have to read it 8 times. I agree this book could be a very good book if they stood with the plot in part 1, but Tom,Sam, and Lonnies life story just isn't interesting. Look at their names, there too basic. Too tell you the truth Kentucky is boring, the books boring, and the author is boring.  You have to drink coffee to read this book; the real downside is that the coffee will end up costing more than the book. My advise to all you readers is to jack the book from Barnes and Noble,Borders or photo copy it, save the money for the coffee because your gonna need it+books
Best Rabbit Book Ever!+P+I have read at least 6 books on raising rabbits and this one is the best by far! (Bennett's other rabbit books are also great - but there is a lot of overlap so only one is needed.) I used his information every step of the way when building my rabbitry, including building my own all-wire hutches. If you are interested in raising rabbits, be sure to join the ARBA (American Rabbit Breeder's Association at http://arba.net/ )It is very inexpensive to join and membership includes a free copy of the "Official Guide Book Raising Better Rabbits & Cavies" 256 pages and another great book. The book itself is worth the membership, but you also get a subscription to the magazine "Domestic Rabbits.+books
The Counterfeit Trinity of Bible Prophecy+P+Returning more fully to the Reformation theology theme of the first volume (&quot;The Antichrist 666&quot;), which theme indeed undergirds the entire series, author and researcher Wil Sutton examines what the Bible has to say about &quot;The Dragon, the Beast, and the False Prophet&quot; the Devil's  counterfeit trinity at the end of time. He examines all forms of paganism/  spiritualism, Satan's original religion from Eden until now (the Dragon),  Roman Catholicism (the Beast), and apostate Protestantism (the False  Prophet). Sutton shows how these three forces are working together to  effect the downfall of humanity today, in the years immediately preceeding  the Second Coming of Christ. Too strong a comment? You NEED this book!  Things are NOT what they seem; what often seems good to human beings ISN'T!  The streams of the previous four volumes meet and end in this one. Bible  prophecy will finally make real sense to you. You will learn what is right  ahead of us in time, and what YOU need to do to get ready: something you  owe it to yourself and your family to learn. Read this one with your 'King  Jimmy' open! I urge you to get this book TODAY! Thanks, Wil, for a  wonderful series (and thanks to your lovely wife Debbie for her tireless  assistance as well!+books

Essential reading if you like boats+P+Phil Bolger is the only boat architect I know who readily admits mistakes. This makes this book the best book about boats one can read. Only mistakes lead to experience. It is incredible how much you learn and how it changes  ones opinion about how a boat should look. Especially those designing  themselves will greatly appreciate all the ideas, ranging from novel to  strange. This is one of the few books on boat-design which I have actually  read from start till end+books

No-nonsense economics at its best+P+Caroline Baum writes about economics and markets like no other journalist.  Her clear thinking, curiosity about how things work, and sparkling style have informed and entertained capital markets participants for two decades.   This book represents her very best stuff.  Read it to understand, to laugh, to be dazzled by her artistry+books
A brilliant book!+P+Finally! A book detailing the most imaginative and thought provoking type of film available: The indie. American independant cinema has consistently produced fresh, off center films, especially from the likes of Richard Linklater, Kevin Smith and Hal Hartley. They're all in here, as well as discussions on films such as the seminal Slackers. To sum up, if you're interested in more than just special effects laden pulp when it comes to movies, buy this book+books
Are we reading a rough draft?+N+Just in the first few paragraphs alone she makes the same point about the smell of the slave market not being quite as strong because of the cool weather 3 times.  It seemed like a redundant effort to fill pages with nonsensical information.  If she had a better editor who helped her catch these errors she could concentrate on making an even deeper more rich story which I believe she desperately wants to accomplish.  Sorry to say I won't be reading another of her stories again+books
Excellent Book+P+I had this for my business law class and it was excellent! It is easy to read, the cases are interesting and the format is one of the best for a textbook!  It made business law enjoyable+books
A powerful little book...+P+This book holds a lot of thought for only 130 pages.  Franz Metcalf takes his knowledge of Buddhism to answer now just the big questions of "Life", but the smaller questions of daily life.  What would Buddha do or think about such subjects as failure, anger, road rage, gun control, lying, the environment, eating meat, money, sex, drinking, drug abuse, boredom and even prostitution.  Hard issues, but each is given a page, answered with a quote from Buddhist teaching and advice from the author. Great gift for a friend or a gift for yourself.  It really helps you strip away the fat and get to the very core of the subject in question+books
Love it!+P+This book is a must-have for all Lennon fans. It has summaries and origins of all his songs from 1970-  .It's full of photos, too! [...+books
A mystery about  foxhunters - with clever dialogue+P+I have enjoyed all of the Mrs. Murphy mysteries, in part because I'm  a cat-and-dog person. The illustrations are a plus, done by people who really know and love animals.  OUTFOXED is written in Ms. Brown's  easy-to-stay-with style, with lots of commentary from the animals involved.  The book may tell more about foxhunting than you might care to know, but Rita Mae Brown makes the human and animal characters so likable that you keep wanting to know what happens to them next.  I hope she will give us more books in this style, as well as keeping on in her collaboration with Sneaky Pie Brown in stories about Mrs. Murphy's doings+books
Best Choice+P+I'd rather give this 4.5 stars, but I can't.  As another reviewer said, one wants to not like this volume.  It's expensive and there are some annoying things about it--for example, the paper is soooo thin you can practically read the recto on the verso--but it is all-around the edition I turn to most often.  The Riverside (I'd judge it to be the other most commonly used anthology) is absolutely ungainly.  Its paper is certainly better, but the thing is absolutely huge.  Looks great on the shelf, but horrible to carry with you to class. I also dislike the Riverside's two column layout and system of notation, which puts notes and glosses at the bottom of the page without indicators in the text. The Norton puts glosses in the margin, which I find infinitely less disturbing and more likely to be helpful, and it numbers footnotes.  It also uses a single-column layout, which I find much easier to read and allows a smaller paper size (same size as all the other Nortons out there, same Bible paper too) without a smaller font size.  The introductions to the individual plays have been farmed out to some of the best in the biz, so it's not just Greenblatt's book.  For what it's worth, his job on the introductory material in this volume matches the quality of what you expect from one of the leading figures in the field.  What's more, the scholarly material is very readable and generally helpful.  Yes, the take of that material is definitely influenced by new historicism and cultural materialism, but anything compiled in the last 20 years is likely to be similarly influenced.  There is also some good theater history help here and some good old facts.  If you have problems with the Oxford edition, then you'll have problems with this one.  If you don't, then it should be fine.  For what it's worth, I reallllly like that there are the three Lear texts.    This is a volume than can just be read if you want to read Shakespeare.  But it's also a book that will get you through the hard stuff and that is fit for scholarly work.      +books

HE'S LAST AND ONLY OTHER BOOK WAS A NATIONAL ENQUIRER STYLE TELL OR -- OR RATHER TELL NOTHING -- ABOUT A FRIEND WHO TRUSTED HIS CONFIDENCE -- JFK JR. BRADLEY CANT EVEN USE HIS REAL NAME -- RICHARD BLOW. HE'S A PHONY AND HE DECIDED TO TRY TO ADD SOME PANACHE TO HIS ALLEGED ROLE AS A WRITER BY DOING A "SERIOUS BOOK ABOUT AN INSTITUTION."

You Never Know What to Expect Next+P+This book is probably one of the best pieces of literature I have ever read.  The ability of the author to go back and forth between characters seemlessley is impeccable and can never be duplicated by another. The idea behind Breakfast of Champions is a conflict between two main characters, Kilgore Trout & Dwayne Hoover, both with seemingly separate lives and completely different views on life, but once their paths are crossed, their lives change forever. In the beginning, a description of the characters are offered with extensive background information all leading up to their lives at the present and how in some way, shape, or form, they both rely on eachother for sanity. The author then goes even further to describe how their present life predicaments are affecting their outlooks on life and their performence both sexually and mentally are changing with every breath they take. Vonnegut goes back and forth between voices, a pious & omniscient figure to becoming either both or one of the main characters, al done seemlessly and impeccably. Kilgore Trout writes stories that the author comes up with which are then transduced as being sources of porographic ideas and Dwayne Hoover is a man who is beoming more and more psychotic everyday, he is losing his grip on reality and with the coming of Kilgore Trout to an art convention that Dwayne is also attending, Trout's stories, specifically one about all people being pre-set robots, causes Dwayne to snap and go on a rampage harming those who are most closest to him as well as people who need to be harmed, but still have no right to be harmed by Dwayne. If anything, this book is a masterpiece and a work of art and I would recommend this book to all whose mind is as twisted and confusing as the author's, as well as someone who can put up with consistent references to the male genitalia, as grotesque as it might become+books
great action+P+I just finished this book (for the second time, actually) and enjoyed it just as much as Reilly's other books.  The hero of the story, William Race, is what many of us would like to be:  a regular guy who, when thrust into extraordinary situations, very capably becomes the hero.  Of course the action is over the top and unrealistic.  It's supposed to be!  I tell everybody who asks that Reilly is the best action writer I've ever read.  I'm not sure why some people blast his books so bad.  Do a little research and know what you're getting into.  If you like high-powered, non-stop action, this is the guy for you.  If you're not, then here's a clue:  DON'T READ REILLY'S BOOKS!!!  Sounds pretty simple+books
satirical chick lit thriller +P+Ruby Silverman co-owns the celebrity frequented baby store Les Sprogs in exclusive Notting Hill section of London.  She ponders the question that has bother humanity for the past century how does a starlet give birth and immediately afterward look like a perfectly fit marathon runner with a waist in negative numbers.  Ruby has noticed that some of customers give birth and arrive with their newborn as svelte as ever.  However, Ruby is shocked when she notices a customer expected to give birth soon has a flat stomach that the store owner envies.  Her belly begins to think there is something sneaky going on so she begins to follow-up that tantalizing clue.  Soon her efforts lead her to nearby St. Luke's Hospital for the rich and famous where she becomes a bit off her sleuthing path because her prime suspect is a gorgeous doctor.  This satirical chick lit thriller is a fun tongue in cheek tale that grips the audience from the moment that Ruby begins to learns the top secret of starlet pregnancies and never slows down until she uncovers the final piece of evidence.  The story line never takes itself seriously as amateur sleuth extraordinaire Ruby investigates the case that leads her into inquiries with eccentric casting.  Chick lit and contemporary fans will enjoy Sue Margolis' mirth and merriment "mystery".  Harriet Klausner+books
My Side of the Mountain+P+The book I read is a pretty fun book! The book My Side of the Mountain by Jean Craighead George is a book where a boy runs away from the city to the mountains. He finds out how to live.  Later he gets a pet falcon and names it Frightful. Soon he finds a man, but he thinks he's a bandit, then he becomes friends with the man. The boy, Sam, finds out he's a professor. He's good at making jam too.  Before the winter he has Halloween with the animal friends he has made, and invites them to his house inside a tree, but it doesn't turn out well after the party.  Sam kills some deer and rabbit to make clothes for the winter. He wears the rabbit's fur as underwear because it's waterproof.   After the winter his parents and sister come to visit him, but they are going to live in a cabin instead of his tree house, so he gets angry but later calms down. I think the writer wants the reader to try running away. I like it because I think I would try running away in the mountains to see what happens.   I highly recommend this book for both parents and kids to read.+books
For Every Edgar Cayce Student+P+I have read 7 of Edgar Cayce's books, this is my 8th. I told myself that I wouldn't read anymore Egar Cayce books until I've read his life story. I'm still reading Edgar Cayce books after reading, &quot;There is a River...&quot; and now I appreciate his books much more now that I know who the individual is. This book is very in depth, but there are some questions that I have that remain unanswered about his life. Perhaps I'll get more info from the book, &quot;Edgar Cayce: An American Prophet&quot;. What I love about Mr. Cayce is that through the whole book, no matter how much fame he got, or how many people looked up to him, he always stayed humble and close to the Bible, which says a lot compared to some psychics that become arrogant just because they have stronger psychic ability than most people. He used his ability not to get rich, but to help people even though he was poor himself. God bless is soul+books
Theatrical Skullduggery+P+Penelope Fitzgerald is at her most devilishly entrancing in this tale revolving around the London acting school run (and I mean RUN!) by Freddie, a larger-than-life Gorgon whose will cannot be resisted. Fitzgerald has fun skewering the backstage pretentions, intrigue and petty jealousies of the London theater world of the early 1960s, but, clearly loving every seedy corner of it, she celebrates it with such gusto that you want to sign up on the spot for a season or two. That combination of wryness and fondness makes this short novel among Fitzgerald's most satisfying. And when Freddie goes out looking for a pound or two, hang on to your wallets+books
A book which will change the way you think+P+It's not a book based on plot or persuasion; merely a book which presents incredible feelings and ideas in a fantastic way. Often we have all wondered about the true nature of simply BEING.  Often we feel as though the world passes us by, or hunts us, or seeks to confuse us.  Pessoa simply puts these feelings into beautifully flowing prose.  Complex ideas and feelings are written of so skillfully that I feel as if we had been the same person.  This book is well worth reading+books
Twisted Freudian Interpretation of An American Icon+N+If a reader were to believe the many ludicrous claims that Adams makes about Thomas Eakins, one would think that the artist was homosexual, heterosexual, bisexual, and a pedophile, exhibitionist, voyeur, sadist, and masochist; and further, that he practiced incest and bestiality (all of which, Adams suggests, was driven by a desire to posses his own mother).  Take your pick!  Adams covers all the bases. Eakins is not so much "revealed" in this book as he is "concealed."  He seems to ignore altogether, what to my mind, are the most fascinating things about this remarkable man: that he studied logarithms for fun, that science, not art, was his first love, that he was conversant in five languages, and that he found beauty where others saw ugliness.  Among the more humorous assertions that Adams makes about Eakins is that the artist painted while sitting on the floor (he used an easel), that he shot his sister's cat for fun (Adams conveniently leaves out the fact that Eakins' father ordered him to do so because the animal was rabid), and that he painted clergymen because they wore dresses, which supposedly reminded Eakins of outfits his dead mother wore.  After reading this dreadful book I came to actually like it as a study of how inbred (dare I say incestuous?) that some members of our academic community have become.  Even if you are convinced, or want to believe that Abraham Lincoln was homosexual, you will still have difficulty making the creative leaps necessary to take this book seriously+books
fantastic reference/crash course+P+This book is straightforward, breaking down each step of the heroic journey, from the hero's birth to apotheosis, using examples from various mythologies/religions to establish the classical pattern used in literature. If you just want to brush up and increase your ability to identify the pattern in literature/pop culture (ie. Aliens movies, The Matrix, Xena, Buffy, Providence...) this is a handy reference and a quick read+books
Too basic+N+My impression was that this tape contained the most basic ideas that author's in this subject matter have ever presented. For eg., &quot;People crossing hands in front of their chest means that they aren't accepting what you are telling them.&quot; That is the most typical statement I have ever heard, and this tape is full of them. There is nothing enlightening, nothing that makes you glad that you bought and listened to the tape. I felt it was not good use of time or money.  Fo+books
Excellent+P+This anthology features extensive introductions by Smiley (a writer's perspective) and Kellog (a philological analysis), illustrations (maps, genealogies, drawings of habitats), an excellent reference section, a thoughtful glossary, and brilliant translations of some of the best prose sagas. The more difficult poetic materials (e.g., the Poetic Edda) are unfortunately not covered, but reasonable translations are available elsewhere. The material provides ample room for an initial but deeper understanding of Norwegian culture. If you were ever curious about Norway and Iceland, don't just sit there: read this book+books
Needed a change and this was the perfect guide!+P+I knew I needed a change in life and a new career. But I new it needed to be something that paid decent and would give me job security.  So I bought this book, read about the different fields and then handed it over to my teenage daughter to get her thinking about her future....This book guided me in the right direction and now I am in school and will graduate in early 2008. I will have job security and a decent salary until I retire.  If you are interested in the medical field then this book is a great guide in helping you decide what you would like to do and how much education you need, where to go to school and what exams you must pass.  Great book for those looking for a career change or just thinking of trying something else in life+books
Not Even Close+N+I am married to a Marine officer who is currently deployed to Iraq for the second time.  As you can imagine, most of our friends are also Marine families.  Additionally, my mother-in-law was a Marine wife for 35 years.  This book is not representative of myself, my mother-in-law, or of ANY military spouse either of us know.  Do not look to this book for an accurate impression of military life.    I don't want to slam Ms Smiley.  She is entitled to her own life experiences.  HOWEVER, they are not typical "military spouse" experiences (far from it) so I am writing this review to make sure potential readers aren't duped into thinking this will give insight into the military life.  It doesn't, and it won't.  The spouses I know are the anti-Smiley.  The spouses I know are educated, capable, strong, witty, caring, giving, women.  The spouses I know would never behave this cowardly toward their military service member or be this careless with their marriages.  I shudder to think that readers would think that she represents me, or any other spouse I know.    DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK if you want to learn real, interesting things about the military.  Read "Making The Corps" instead.    Do not read this book if you like inspired, compelling story-lines.  Regardless of the military angle, the story is weak and the writing is bad.  Am I qualified to judge a good book?  Maybe.  I read about 25 books a year and I am fairly well aquainted with the best seller lists.  In the end, though, it's all about your personal taste.  Read this book if you like non-best-seller-list chic lit+books
Excellent introductory book on the sesual world of fragances+P+This handy little book packs quiet a punch.  It contains history,  scientific theories, artistic interpretations, production methods, and  detailed glossary of the essential oils and where to get them.  A must have for people who wants to experiment with creating their own secented materials+books
Monumental history of psychoanalysis+P+This book is the type of history that students rarely get to see.  Textbooks tend to repeat the same old stories, many of which are only loosely based on the facts.  This book goes into great depth, and even shows that many famous &quot;cures&quot; were nothing of the sort.  This should be required reading for psychotherapists, and more importantly, for their clients+books
Not what was expected+N+Only basic info on planning a project and included plans are just a teaser to get you to purchase complete plans. There are much better general barn/shed books+books
You dont really get your Bang for your Buck+N+I have to say that I was really dissapointed in this book.  I know it says there are 23 stories, so I should haev been better prepared for short stories...only some of them were only like 5 pages long, and on top of that, they were just plain stupid.  I think this was a waste and I know I will not buy any moer books that have large groupings of stories in them.  Hey, I like a good hot juicy sex scene as much as the next person, but i think i would prefer  a little more depth of the story than what you get with this group of stories. Some of the stories in here would have you going &quot;huh?&quot; after you read it.  What else can you say..+books
A Waste of Money+N+I bought the Wharton's Stretching book and liked it, finding it very useful as a martial artist. This book, however, merely rehashes everything in the Stretching book, but in an inferior manner. Although it has photos instead of drawings, the Wharton's Stretch book clearly shows acceptable ranges of motion for each stretch. In addition, the Back Book has a section on training with weights that bordered on ridiculous. The author's clearly know little about neither weight training as therapy nor weight training for strength and flexibility. This book was a real disappointment. Buy their first book, avoid this one+books
Jewish Tenements+P+This is really an artful piece of work. Eisner was a revolutionary. He paved the way for stories that were embedded in reality. He really inspired another legend, Frank Miller who produced Daredevil's best run and Sin City. These are some really gripping stories that grasped at my heart strings I felt sorry for the wife of the alley singer, I felt sorry for the rabbi who lost his daughter, etc. Well it seems I just felt sorry for these folks. If you're a comic fan, you love reality represented and you like tan and white (which Eisner said is the color people dream in) then this is the book for you+books
Totally Delicious-The Red Book Delivers+P+I am a person who cherishes their connection to the Divine.  I am always looking for new books that can inspire me on my spiritual path.  This book delivers!  I totally love it.  Beautifully written with great soul!  I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking to ignite their Divine Spark with great love and self acceptance+books
horrible+N+war books are not my favorite, but even so this book sucked. i will admit when i am wrong about a book but i was not wrong about this 1. from the moment my prof. assigned it, i knew it would be like pulling teeth to finish and it was! this is notttttttttttttttttttttt a classic or anything close to 1. spend ur ten dollars on a pillow cause you are going to need it+books
Dreams in Action+P+I love the idea of this book, the story behind it, and the wisdom it contains. With a great mix of inspiration and nuts-and-bolts information, the book covers a multitude of topics, and gives the reader room to expand on her own ideas. This would make a great graduation present, new-phase-in-life present, or a "big" birthday present for someone who has put her "try-it" days behind her.+books
Well Dressed and Mannerful Men don't do Very Well+N+This book is well written by a woman who would know a lot about advances and pick ups. However, her book really only scratches the surface of learning to date out of your league. Yes she tells you how to dress, yes she tells you how to eat properly, and yes she even tells you how to be a VIP (All very interesting and good tips by the way) But what made this book unhelpful was the lack of content. You cannot only tell a man to dress well and act wealthy but you must give him content! tell him what to say! tell him what to do! tell him what won't work! The Author goes in depth into each sign of interest a woman can show, but if a man cannot even be interesting in conversation why would a woman ever show interest? If your looking for a book to tell you how to dress like Sean Connery and become a VIP at your local restuarant then buy this book. But if your looking for a book that will teach you how to talk to woman, tell funny stories, and get them interested in you I recommend you look elsewhere+books
I officially hate this book!+N+I, also, must second Mark Twain. This book is a waste of time! Why do teachers make us read it when we should be reading Tolkien, GK Chesterton, CS Lewis, and the like? Agh. Then, that could just be my wacky taste in novels...   But this was bad. Oh my gosh!!! The descriptions were ALWAYS needlessly long, the conversations ALWAYS needlessly long, the... blah, blah, blah, blah. That's what the whole thing was. Blah. The whole plot could have been totally condensed to a hecka short 200 pg novel and it would have been a million times better! Maybe even good! And I like long books!   This book is terrible. Listen to the warning of a fellow voracious reader and do not waste your time!+books
Skip it!+N+Very basic book that covers no new ground.  Go to your local library and find a fitness/weight lifting book.  You won't miss anything by taking this route and passing on this relatively useless book. +books
Gluten Free+N+I was sort of disappointed with this....the recipes are not as diverse as I would have liked. More deserts and I was not interested in deserts.  What could I do with gluten free bread? I should have done more research before I ordered this+books
nothing special+N+I do not quite understand why this should be a recommended Buk-Book. It is a fairly interesting interview, alright. But if you're going to spend money on Bukowski: buy HIS books. And if you want biographical information, go with Howard Sounes. To get a real good look on Bukowski you also might want to check out the 'Bukowski-Tapes' - Film-Interviews by Barbet Schroeder. Pivano's Interview reveals nothing new is not really worth the money+books
not as good as King Leopold's ghost, but still worth the read...+P+After reading King Leopold's Ghost, I was looking for a good synopsis of what happened in the post-colonial era.  After a few weeks of searching, I settled on In the Footsteps of Mr. Kurtz. Both were fascinating books that give great insight on the problems with the Congo.  Both are written in a style that is highly readable, entrhalling and at the same time informative.+books
Great book - read it +P+It's not a player book;  I was looking at Christian based books on Dating & relationships and this book kept coming up. It explains women psychology in Dating+books
Stereotype upon stereotype+N+We are reading this book for our book group.  I'm not sure if it made me uncomfortable because the perspective was so accurate or if it was because it never went beyond the stereotypes that I already have.  I didn't like one character in the book.  Even the dogs and the kid were annoying.  While that may have been the result of good writing, the end product was that I was left feeling nothing but "ick."   The characters seemed one dimensional even though a large amount of time was spent detailing their thoughts and opinions.  I never understood the "why's" behind any of their actions, just their histories.  Perhaps I was too slow to draw the conclusion.  I felt like a big, over consumerized, ungrateful loser.

Sinks like a stone, stinks like a monkey+N+This is the first book by Deaver that I have read.  Apparently there are a couple of prequels to this novel involving the same main characters -- I will never read them.  Deaver has adequate style and a talent for pacing a mystery thriller.  He also has some skill in character development; however, he only applies this skill to the secondary characters in this story.  Perhaps the main characters in this story appeared so flat to me because I have not read the other novels in this series, but judging by their inconsistent behavior, bizarre motivations, and the melodramatic dialogue in this novel I doubt the other books could be much better.  Worse than Deaver's hackneyed mystery cut-out-characters is his insistence that the reader be willing to accept the most unbelievable and unlikely situations for the sake of a dramatic situation or plot twist.  Like many other second-drawer mystery writers, Deaver portrays such notable organizations as the FBI, INS, US Coast Guard, and the NYPD as ridiculously inept and corruptible.  Nor has he made any attempt to research the actual policies and procedures that these organizations would follow in the situations presented in the story.  Deaver also has a poor grasp on the politics of international economics.  This is normally excusable in a mystery writer, but since Deaver sets Chinese/American economics as the foundation of his final plot twist the whole story comes crashing down in the final chapters of the novel.       A note to Deaver and other mystery writers:  it is not a requirement for a great detective to be a pompous jerk and an abrasive know-it-all.  It has been 115 years since Doyle introduced the world to Sherlock Holmes, and we have had 115 years of mediocre mystery writers plagiarizing Doyle's character.  Please try to be original.   And also, if the final "twist" in your story is so complicated and so unbelievable that you must expend two chapters in trying to explain it, perhaps it shouldn't be there in the first place.  I give this book a D.   +books
FABULOUS!+P+THIS BOOK SHOWS WHAT THE GREAT LINEUP OF BROADWAY SHOWS WAS FOR 2001-2002 AND IT NOT ONLY LISTS IT BARELY, IT GOES INTO DEPTH ON HUGE HITS LIKE MAMMA MIA! AND THOROUGHLY MODERN MILLIE.  ITS REALLY GREAT+books
Fallacious Arguments+N+Undoubtedly, felons who commit heinous crimes deserve to be sentenced to death. There is no argument there. In my view, child molestors, murderers and rapists have forfeited their legal right to live in our society. It should be stressed that a gruesome deed must not be justified under any circusmtances; if a malefactor has had a difficult childhood this cannot excuse let alone justify his actions. This is irrefutable! As is well-known, psychopaths are usually cunning, insidious, manipulative, narcissistic and charming. Moreover, they are unable to feel guilt and remorse. Rehabilitation is effective in some cases but in most cases it does not work. Notorious felons are known to relapse into criminality upon release. Psychopaths can often deceive their psychiatrists because they are manipulative and shrewd. Therefore, capital punishment is the most effective punishment next to life sentence+books
The Increasingly-Forgotten Forefather+P+Kipling has undeservedly been relegated to obscurity.  He is the foundation of the modern-day action movie.  His tight prose bespeaks his journalist background in a time when fewer and fewer writers can hone their craft in these jobs.  This selection of his most famous and best work is a wonderful addition to anyone's library, especially if you're a Tolkien fan or interested in the Victorian period+books

Stands Out...As a Bad Book+N+I'm surprised at all the good reviews this book got. Not to be snide, I just genuinely am.   This book looms in my memory as the one book I had to drag myself to finish. A book that made me tear up with boredom. The plucky heroine wasn't likable, the names were all forced and strange (none making sense in a universe together--more like an assortment of characters from different books) , not on the unique side, really.  I thought any originality forced and unfounded, and wished it would have turned out better for me, especially as the "magic dust" theory was such a nice start.  The ending wasn't predictable, but it was trying so very hard NOT to be, it couldn't possibly have been anything but what it was: Dull.  With all these good reviews, and me not having read it in years, it might be worth trying, but I stand firm: take it out of the library+books
Reading other's email is fun!+P+I loved this book! it was written in email form and frankly i love reading email and being sneaky and reading other's email is quite fun as well so reading this book was a little guilty pleasure!  it is about a woman who finds neighbor passed out and then her 'nephew' comes to take care of her pets while the neighbor is in coma in hospital. turns out the nephew isnt really the nephew but a friend the nephew made help him out because he didnt want to help his aunt. the woman has emails from her friends in there, coworkers as well. it is really a fun quick read. +books
Angry plus dissapointment+N+After buying and reading the book I realized that I need a lathe to make the gun. Lost my money! I think that the author should let the visitors know about that &quot;little fact&quot; before buying the book+books
The Sign of the Beaver+P+This is a book about a boy named Matt and his adventures.  Matt's father goes back to Quincy to get Matt's two sisters and his mom.  Matt has to survive in the woods alone.  He might even make friends with some unexpected people.  I really liked The Sign of the Beaver because it had a good beginning and showed a lot of emotion within the characters.  When the author wrote about one part of the book, I thought there was going to be a different ending.  I was very surprised about what the ending really was.  The author described the book with very interesting words that really explained what the story is about.  Matt makes friends with an Indian boy named Attean.  Their relationship is complicated.  This book is one of the best novels I've ever read. I hope you get a chance to read it+books
Beautiful book+P+This is such a visually stunning book.  I've only made a couple of the dishes in here and they've been good.  But it's more about the write ups on the different foods and the pictures.  It makes a great gift for someone special+books
Shallow Reading+N+This book was very shallow and too general.  Didn't go in depth at all. +books
Not what I expected+N+I thought this would be a list of adult grahic novels, like those of Harvey Pekar.  A few were, but many were for children or comic book collectors.  I do not think some of them really qualify as graphic novels.  From the term "your library" I understood my own personal library, but seems it is for public librarians serving a mixed public. Fine, but I did not see that in the editorial description+books
Waste of Time!+N+I'm SO glad I got this book from the library instead of buying it.  It was worth the 75c hold fee, but not much more.  I was expecting "stuff you can make with whatever small amounts of yarn you have in your stash", but got "stuff you can make with a few skeins of expensive luxury yarns".  There are VERY few projects in here I'd ever consider making.  If I should decide I want to make one, I'll check the book out again, but I won't be buying this for myself or anyone else, ever+books
Keynes' disorganized critique of the Versailles Treaty+N+This book achieved instant fame when it was published in 1919, not only for its scathing criticism of the Versailles Treaty but also for its personal attacks against leading signatories (especially Clemenceau and Wilson).  For a book focused primarily on economic concerns, the text is surprisingly easy to read.  However, the book's poor organization vitally detracts from its effectiveness.  The principle reason the book is still famous today lies in the fact that it was written by none other than John Maynard Keynes, the founder of 20th century style, gov't & debt driven economics.  The book is organized into chapters on pre-war Europe, Allied statesmen, summary of key treaty points, reparations, post-war Europe predictions, and Keynes' suggestion of remedies to provide a practical treaty settlement.  Unfortunately, within each chapter things are jumbled together without clear rhyme or reason.  (Is this indicative of Keynes' own personal organization and logical thinking?)    Within the book, he makes a very practical (but politically infeasible) argument for a non-vindictive treaty.  He basically suggests that the Allies should forget both about reparations and repayment of wartime debts from the other Allies, and instead they should settle (though not ideally) for frontier adjustments and confiscation of only German gov't property.  (Did the German gov't sponsor Keynes' work in writing this book?)  Keynes argues that a crushing reparations burden on the German people would disincent them to produce anything beyond a mere subsistence minimum and discourage entrepreneurial enterprise.  There is some logic in this point; however, later on he goes on to state that the US should forgive its $10 billion debt to its wartime allies ($5 billion of which was owed by the UK).  Forgive me if I'm wrong, but doesn't such a move disincent American entreprises from entrepreneurship as well.  It's extremely hypocritical that the Allied gov'ts desperately sought loans from the US during the war and then once it was over to claim that they couldn't pay them.  If they didn't want to repay, then they shouldn't have borrowed the money - period.  (If I borrow money to buy a home, the bank won't ever agree to forgive my debt - regardless of whether I'm out of work, injured, or the house burns down.  I don't see why gov'ts should get any exceptional treatment.)  Notwithstanding his problems with disorganization and inconsistent logic, Keynes does produce a reasonable, brief list of treaty rememdies, especially in his efforts to restore economic life throughout Central and Eastern Europe.  Not until the advent of the Cold War and the interests of extending American political influence would Keynes' policies largely succeed (albeit yet again to the detriment of American taxpayers).  Overall, I felt the book was ok.  I would only recommend it if you have an interest in reading all of Keynes' work.  Don't expect to find any theoretical economic insights in the book, though.  Based on the high ratings on this page, I think the other reviewers here might have some pro-Keynesian bias+books
Self Deception+N+Those looking for a wife in Russia, here is word of advise to you. I know many man who went to Russia and ukraine looking for woman. Few of them have a happy marriage. Most (I didn't said all) men go there to find woman will not have a good marriage for several reasons, 1. Some men are pigs and going to find a woman in other country is an escape. They should change the way they treat woman. I know many Russian woman who had to flee from their American husbands. 2. Some American man will be deceived by Russian woman and think they getting into lasting relationships while woman want to get to US to get a permanent residency. Especially when age difference is more that 10 years. Why younger woman would mary much older man? Money and opportiunity most of the time.  I know christian man who was looking for a bride in post USSR country. He was in his 50's. Very religious man. But when it came to relationships, he is looking at 20- 30 year old woman. They (women) were disgusted just to think of being with him.  The are other guys who went to Russia. They were sitting on a curb in front of University. They weren't shaved and didn't look appealing. They would pick a beatifull young girl and would try to start conversation. Young ladies wouldn't even pay attention. Then old drunk lady came by and start talking to these american guys. And that's who would entertain these men. Russians don't sit on a flor and only drunkards sit on a curb. I think anybody who says that Russian woman better than American has never digged deep in the U.S.A. There are also many Russian woman who stuck up. How will you, comming from a different country will find out what is gold and what is not? Go there, learn the culture, language, live there for 10 years and then you might be qualified to mary Russian lady.  I'm sick of a man who goes to other countries for the purpose of marying someone just because they see problem with woman in their own country. These man has a problem that they need to deal with before they can have any relationships. They need therapy, counceling, they are bossy and they are the ones who stuck up. They need to learn how Jesus treats the church and even died for it. Will you give up your live for the one you love? Or you only interested to satisfy your selfish desires+books
Cinema 4D 9.5 Excellent! well written, easy to follow.+P+This book has provided me with a hands on guid that I have search for many years. I am new to animation, and I think Mr. Mitchell did a fantastic job of explaining and making his real world application easy to follow. This book has taught me more about professional animation than any other books in my library. To me the CD is an added bonus. I would highly recommend this book to any beginner who is trying Learn 3D animation production. The only negative thing I have to say is, why it took you so long to publish a book that gave someone like me the confidence in learning 3D animation. I was able to create my first animated characters by using this book, by adding this book to your library, you will be gaining a wealth of knowledge. By the way, when is your next book coming out? Simply, this book is GREAT+books
The Myth of the Robber Barons+P+Excellent book about the greatness of the entrepeneurs who didn't have to rely on gov't subsidies to succeed!  Finally, a chance to hear the other side of the story. Gov't subsidies have always resulted in failure and this finally shows who the great industrialists of the 20th century were and that true laissez faire capitalism can work! Enjoy+books
hilarious+P+A book about the show that revolutionized the sports tv show by the two guys who were the stars of the show. Funniest section is where they talk about those little catch-phrases everyone gets stuck in their head. You know like, &quot;from way downtown...bang!!&quot; and &quot;he put the biscuit in the basket&quot;. Hilarious!+books
There is yet more to learn about those old stories!+P+If you have a King James version of the Bible,  the next time you read Genesis, pay attention to how God is referred to.  Sometimes He's called "God" and sometimes He's called "The Lord".  The reason for this is that the original Hebrew text uses two different names for God, and the translators were careful to preserve this.  When the Hebrew text uses "Elohim" it is translated as "GOD".  When the Hebrew text uses "Yahweh", it is translated as "The Lord".  If you carefully read Genesis, you'll notice that when Genesis refers to God as "Yahweh", he seems to be very different than when he is refered to as "Elohim".  For example, Elohim is invisible--he never appears to anybody nor can he be seen by anybody--but Yahweh talks face-to-face with people all the time: with Abram, to Jacob, and to Moses and the 40 elders.  Elohim seems remote and regimented, whereas Yahweh comes across as mischevious and irrascible.  This has prompted some to propose the so-called "Documentary Hypothesis" which posits that Genesis was formed by editing together two or more different books, each book using a different word for God and each book presenting a different picture of who God was and what He was all about.    The book of J is the hypothasized book which used 'Yahweh" as the name of God.  Scholars try to reconstruct this book by bringing together all of the passages in the first 5 books of the Bible which refer to God as "Yahweh".  The result is startling: the same stories you've heard all your life (The tower of Babal, Joseph going to Egypt, Abram bargaining with God over Sodom and Gomorrah), when read together like this, take on a whole different level of meaning.    This book provides two things in one handy volume: it provides a reconstruction of the book of J, freshly translated by David Rosenberg, and it also provides an extended commentary by Harold Bloom, who is certainly the best reader alive today, and who is uniquely qualified to serve as a tour guide through the experience of reading J.  So to review the book I'd like to review each of these seperately.  First, Rosenberg's translation.  To illustrate just how good it is at bringing things out of the text which you ordinarly wouldn't notice, I'd like to quote from his translation of the story of the Tower of Babal: "We can bring ourselves together" they said "like stone on stone, use brick for stone: bake it until hard."  For morter they heated bitumen.  Notice how this translation brings out the parallelism between the tower of Babal and human society:  The tower is made out mud bricks bound by bitumen, and society is made out of people bound by language.  But people are also just made out of mud--recall the creation story where Yahweh breathes the breath of life into mud.  Baking the mud into bricks is symbolic of the people making themselves hard, and using bitumen for morter is symbolic of them using language and government to  organize themselves.   Rosenberg's translation makes available to us many of the puns and wordplay which other English translations unfortunately lose.  Now, to review Bloom's commentary.  Scholarly types are fond of dising Bloom for his tendency to be speculative, to use his imagination to illuminate the reading of the text.  But what they are forgetting is that J is a bunch of stories, written for us to experience!  To use an parable of Rorty's, its like a surgion describing your wife as a bunch of tissues and organs vs. describing your wife as  warm and loving, important person in your life. Yes, "warm and loving" arn't medical terms, but that doesn't make them a bad description of your wife.    Also, the very greatest literature, such as J is, will admit of more than one reading, more than one interpretation, more than one point of view.  Bloom here does us excellent service by showing us his point of view on the text, telling us how the experience of reading the text impacts him.  The author of J didn't write J just to chronicle some historical figures--the author of J wrote J so that we could read it, and by reading it, become changed into new people.  _This_ is the aspect of experiiencing J which Bloom's commentary helps along, and this is the aspect which critics of Bloom's commentary are missing the most+books
Past Meets Present in Another Anne Perry Gem +P+Long Spoon Lane: A Charlotte and Thomas Pitt Novel, by Anne Perry was another excellent mystery set in Perry's evocative Victorian setting.  The mystery in this novel was not of the "knock your socks off who would have ever thought it" type.  It was, rather, a very evenly paced novel in which many of the developments involved terrorism and the government's response to the terrorists' acts.  It was very interesting to read about a piece of legislation that some of the characters supported.  The legislation involved giving the police easier rules and access to search people and their homes.  The obvious allusion to America's Patriot Act and the debate it has spawned is an excellent piece of the overall picture.    This book focused on Thomas primarily, and his relationship with one of his true enemies.  His Professor Moriarty if you will.    I recommend this book and give it a solid and well deserved 4 out of 5 stars. +books
Great Book For Summer Time Traveling with the Kids+P+We got this book last year at Christmas, and it has some great ideas for &quot;spontaneous' games that you can play with the kids while traveling.

There are many games that take no planning, and use common  things around you, to entertain, get silly, and just enjoy+books
You have a brand whether you think you do or not...+P+It's relatively easy to get someone to make a single purchase from you.  But how do you instill that long-term loyalty and love that causes people to refuse to buy from anyone else?  Ben Mack talks about that and many other branding issues in the book Think Two Products Ahead: Secrets the Big Advertising Agencies Don't Want You to Know and How to Use Them for Bigger Profits.  It's an unconventional book that doesn't mince words...  Contents: Pool Hall Wisdom; Brand Misinformation versus Back-End Thinking; The Common Thread and Thinking Two Products Ahead; Branding? Be Good to Your Gander; Branding Processes Are Strikingly Similar; What's a Brand Essence?; Legendary Branding; Extracting a Brand Essence; The Kama Sutra of Marketing - Five Basic Positions; Framing to the Right Target Audience; Structured Creativity - Framing Tools; Creativity on Demand - Why Ad Agencies Can't Brainstorm; Feed Their Passions; Plan to Have Many Conversations; Everything Communicates; Storytelling - Letting the Genie Out of the Bottle; Branding and Thinking Two Products Ahead; Myth, Magic, and Making Money the Old-Fashioned Way; AKS; Jeff Lloyd's Secret to Commercial Residential Real Estate Sales; How to Turn Every First Sale into a Residual Stream of Income; Direct Response Branding; Acknowledgements; Index  Mack states that successful branding comes when you start thinking two products ahead of the current sale.  In other words, you need to be thinking about the overall story and impression that your company and product leaves with a customer.  This collection of legends and perceptions defines your brand, not the cute logo or corporate colors you stick on your products.  What that means is that you *have* a brand whether you think you do or not.  You need to bring your customer into the "marketing funnel", which is a four stage process: intrigue, consider, interested, and buy.  When you get them to buy, then the "two products ahead" mindset turns them from one-off buyers to loyal customers.  It's all a matter of managing your brand...  the story that your customers tell about your company and product.  This book started off as an e-book that the author marketed himself (for a much higher price).  His style of writing and communication is frank and blunt, with no room for dancing around an issue.  As such, it's a lot of fun to read.  Since I don't have a marketing background, I found it a little difficult to keep the finer points of marketing vs. branding vs. selling straight at times.  But overall, I got the message that your brand is a priceless asset, and it's important to do everything you can to make sure that brand says the right thing to your customer.  A valuable read for any business, but especially for the small business owner who doesn't think he has a brand...  he does.+books
In My Trashcan+N+This book is awful.  What a disappointment after such great success with Theodore Roosevelt.  I forced myself through half this book straining to distinguish reality from the fiction and fantasy that Morris interjects willy-nilly throughout.  What a chore, what a bore, what a waste.  This went in the trash can rather then the bookshelf to insure no one else might pick it up and waste as much time as I did on it. +books
Pringle's Picks+N+I wish this book had been titled, Science Fiction: MY favorite 100 novels. I can see what authors Mr. Pringle likes (Dick, Heinlein, Moorcock, to name a few) and what his taste in sci-fi is and can even probably determine his age, but objectively speaking (if I am in fact, being objective) I think a lot of novels that should have been in the top 100 were left off off his list. Of course we all have our opinions of what the best science fiction is, and if you like science fiction that usually means you love it and therefore probably have strong opinions, so if you find you share his tastes then this is the 100 for you.  I did get a few suggestions from it so it was somewhat helpful.+books
it's a reminder+N+If you haven't learned from a teacher, you won't learn from this book.  It does serve, however, as a reminder for someone who has moved away from other practitioners, so that a thorough workout doesn't leave out any of the forms, letting it fade into the oblivion of the memory+books
Family Favorite+P+Mrs. Piggle Wiggle was 'The Nanny'/'Dr.Phil' of her time.  These stories offer parents and children interesting ways to deal with daily chores and struggles that can sometimes seem overwhelming. I enjoyed reading this book as a child and couldn't resist purchasing it for my girls 4 and 2 to enjoy.  We have been working our way through various childrens' novels as part of our bedtime ritual. Books like this are good for holding the attention of children at various levels of reading and reading comprehension. These stories have also served as a springboard for discussion in our family about finding creative new ways to accomplish the many tasks that need to be done to keep the household running.  Some of the material may seem dated, but it's definetely a classic. +books

Fluff book with no practical advice+N+This book uses a lot of buzz words and offers very little substantial advice when it comes to actually designing your own house.  It touches a little on straw bale and reused materials and barely grazes cob/clay/rammed earth.  It doesn't even mention geodesic domes as far as I can tell.  The book advocates on one page (p.72) that people should live in small humble buildings, only having the square footage they absolutely need.  Then a few pages later (p.79) it shows a 4000+ sq. ft. home, with the title "an excersize in efficiency."  I fail to see anything efficeint about a 4000 sq. ft. home, especially when it's a standard A-frame building (granted, it's for a family of 6, but then again there's nothing "green" about having 4 children).  It does cover some good stuff like gray-water use, rain collection, alternative heating and cooling, but it glosses over all of this and takes up a lot of space with strange-angled shots of rooms and floor plans.  I KNOW the floor plan I want, and there's very little that a floor plan has to do with green building (it's more about orientation to the sun for passive solar use).  What I'd prefer to have seen was simple diagrams of how the systems of the house work.  There's a spot that explains how one house has the pool hooked up to the AC such that the hot exhaust from the AC heats the pool.  Now THAT's something I can get into, but I want more than a couple sentences about it.  That deserves a diagram+books
I love books and this one is just bad...+N+Boring, outdated ex-patriate story of life in Paris between the wars, focusing on a young American actress, a psychologist Dr. Diver and his wife, an American baroness with issues.  Lots of drinking and gossip+books
Save your money and just write.+N+I like readable prose.  This is more like poetry with meaning that must be disciphered or intuited.  I am disappointed and am sending the book back.  I bought it on the basis of the first reviewer but it didn't impress me as much.  I think it would be better to write rather than read more esoteric writing about writing.  I would pass on this one+books

The return of cruelty and oppression+P+The brave Anna Politkovskaya reveals the reality of Russia today in this sad, sometimes horrifying book. After a brief window period of freedom under Yeltsin, Russia has rapidly become a vast swamp of corruption, oppression and deception under Putin.   Politkovskaya tells of the trouble and suffering of ordinary people who are humiliated and exploited by the criminal nomenklatura. For example Nina Levurda, who in trying to establish the truth about her son's death in the Chechen War, became a victim of this system that when not cruel, is completely indifferent to the individual. This and other cases are discussed in the chapter My Country's Army And Its Mothers.   In Russia, people imitate the man at the top, thus Putin is the one who shapes Russian society. It is mainly he who is to blame for the brutality and extremism prevalent in the army and the state apparatus. There are sections dealing with war criminals, brutality against privates in the military, government complicity in crime, the corruption in the judiciary, the struggle to survive in places like Kamchatka, and racism against people with a non-Slavic appearance.   Russia's stability is of a monstrous type, where power means everything, few people hold the law in any regard, bribes keep business and the state running, and a free press has almost disappeared. Putin's bureaucrats have taken corruption to new records, unheard of even under Yeltsin or the Communists. As a lieutenant-colonel who never made it to the rank of colonel, he has the mentality of a Soviet secret policeman. The Yukos affair and the imprisonment of Mikhail Khodorkovsky demonstrate what a vindictive little man Putin is and how he is steering the country towards fascism.   This process of crushing dissent and stifling freedom has been escalating throughout Putin's first presidential term and shows no sign of abating during the second. The Western press has mostly not showed great interest in this slide to oppression in Russia. It is hard not to write Russia off when confronted by the experiences in this book: the deliberate cruelties, the cold indifference and the manipulation of the media. Mercifully there are still people like Politkovskaya and Lev Ponomarev who are brave enough to speak out. This disturbing book concludes with explanatory notes containing references.+books
Ok, but missing a lot of info!+N+Overall this book was ok.  Nothing special about it.  I am a cleaning business owner and noticed that the book was flawed.  I would like the author to please show me where a person can get 1 million dollars worth of insurance for $250-$400 as the book states.  Most people can not even get insured for that amount in any state until they have been in business for 3 years.  The author left out a lot of information and I would not recommend this book to anyone who is serious about starting a cleaning business.  The only thing decent in the book is the appendix, but even that is not detailed enough.  I give it two stars for effort and because I am a nice person+books
Repeat+N+I bought this hoping to add to my collection of Judy Reeves's prompts, unfortunately all this is is a repackaging of A Writer's Book of Days: A Spirited Companion and Lively Muse for the Writing Life.  The year's worth of prompts are in the kit's book, followed by lined pages.  The advice and encouragement on the kit's cards can be found among the pages of her Writing Book of Days.  I'm very disappointed that Reeves couldn't create more prompts rather than simply making more money off of her previous work+books
The People You Meet+P+One of the joys of reading fiction is in the people you meet on the way. The truly great books have you almost grieving for the characters to whom you must say goodbye as you close the book. So it is with The Gold Bug Variations - I miss Ressler too.  You'll read the prose that approaches poetry, the virtuosity, the contrapuntal style (not contrapunctal, as one reviewer put it), and the breadth of subject material. All of these delight and dazzle, but with Ressler, Powers reaches the heart+books
Disappointed+N+After reading the Oprah Pick, "What Looks Like Crazy on an Ordinary Day, I was very disappointed in "Some Things I Never Thought I'd Do."  It took me two long weeks to finish this slim novel and I lost interest after about the first fifty pages.  I don't think Pearl Cleage is a paticularly talented novelist; I think she can write realistic,sometimes dynamic dialogue between her black characters, but the story is lacking.    I loved the very first part of the book where Regina Burns has just gotten out of rehab, is losing her anscestral home, so she goes to her aunt Abbie for help and comfort and Abbie introduces Regina to the notion that life is not a lost cause--that is the story I wanted to read.  Instead, what I got is a very political story infused with the author's belief that black men especially need positive role models.  I believe we ALL need to be and have positive role models, that it is not just a black thing.    I wanted to read more about Regina and Blue.  I felt as if that part of the story was horribly under developed.  I hope that Pearl Cleage's next novel is better than this one, but I'm sorry to say I don't hold out much hope+books
Gorky's son in law+P+Matthew Spender has something to offer for someone really curious about this artists work. I have been compairing the three biographies. Herrara's book has been much acclained. But, when it comes to getting into the nitty -gritty of an artist's work, Spender is better. Particularly when he writes of his work in the fields of Virginia.None of the other writers have really tackled this important part of Gorky's art. As a sculpture Spender must have wondered would Gorky  like me and my work.The Armenian backgound has been covered by quite a few books.

a very bad reason to kill trees+N+Ok, first of all, read that ttle again. Don't you love how idiotic grown ups sounds when they try to, like, borrow the vernacular twists of their offspring for ironic employment in a, like, polemical setting? Reminds me of Cusack's dad in 'Better off Dead,' the way he keeps trying to talk to his son on his son's level. There's so much bad faith and pretension permeating this book- it's all there in the title...  As for the' author's "polemic," it basically consits of numerous, misinformed, tendentious tracts soldered together into a rusty heap. You've heard this spiel before, most likely from your grandparents or parents who just don't get it- that they had their time. This is our era. Our use of language reflects and underlines our differences from those who came before.   I particularly didn't like his seeming dismissal/blanket statement on hip hop. He really ain't down with the brothas, which is not surprising, given that he's a black intellectual, and there's nothing established black academics like more than a long-winded, whingeing harangue about the endemic evils of hip hop Kulture. Ugh. He doesn't even seem to possess much of a knowledge of hip hop artists or their work... Nada... There is much that I find execrable in said culture and in it's major 'artists' but still how can one overlook its myriad unifying and artistic elements... Even I manage not to fall prey to an all-too-easy reductionist formula, which seems to be the The main point here- the author views the degredation of the english Language through the lens of pop culture at large (as a bad thing, mind you), it begins in the evil counterculture 60's and... you know...   Digressive, ranting out-of-context mixed with counter-intuitive psuedo-linguistic gibberish. For example, the author holds up both Dylan and Tom waits as examples of artists who are reverred not for their songwriting abilities, but more for their authenticity, thir 'genuineness'. This is plain false. Laughably false. I've never met a fan of either artist who wasn't struck by their strange and completely idiosyncratic use of language. Moreover, the author seems to feel that pop culture music is driven by whites emulating blacks. True, up to a point. I love this stance, and from Chuck Berry to James Brown to Miles Davis to Funkadelic to Fishbone to Bad Brains, to the innumerable black influences on The Clash, I will never tire of pointing out that, basically, it's all black music. One would think that, at least on some level, this is a good thing... But no, it leads back to the counter-kulture (with a k) ideals that have subverted language...????   HUH?  The saddest thing is that, as a reactionary elitist, I'm inclined to agree with many of the author's basic points. But both his presentation and his defense of his points were so hare-brained and wrong, I just felt sullied. With friends like these... +books
The Pool Party by Gary Soto, Robert Casilla (illustrator)+P+I believe that third and fourth graders would really enjoy this text about this Mexican American youngster.  Children would also enjoy the occasional Spanish included in the text.  The only problem: Soto does not include a glossary this time.  Oh well, Soto does a great job of portraying a family that understands what it means to really work for a living and teaches kids not to take everything for granted.  Soto stays away from the sterotypical "lazy mexican"+books
Should be titled: History of Plumbing for those behind the power curve.+N+I wanted to find out about modern plumbing (like PEX)and what kind of tools, code changes, etc. that are necessary for installing PEX plumbing.  Not in this book.  That information must have fallen through the cracks (no plumber joke intended).  Author is stuck in the past.  Needs to be updated, revised, or recycled.  Kind of a bummer.  Now I have a book that I can't use.  Sweating copper...come on now.  The rest of us have made it to the 21st century+books

Buy the 2006+N+I think it's disgusting the lack of research Yale Daily News put into this 2007 guide.  There are a hundred things wrong with this guide, but just from opening to the school I go to (University of Delaware), and seeing that one of the things I have to do before I graduate is "go to the Stone Balloon," I could tell this book was just a new cover to the 2006 with updated admissions statistics.  The Stone Balloon, a historic University of Delaware Bar and Music Hall, announced more than a year ago that it was going to be knocked down and replaced by condiminiums on Main Street.  This was true, and it was closed for the spring, and camera crews were there at the beginning of the summer to see huge bulldozers knock it over.  Pretty sad that NO ONE will be able to fulfill the Insider's Guide's instructions.  Sweet life Yale...do some research and stop making money reprinting the same "best-selling" book each yea+books

A Master Storyteller - A Masterful Rendering+P+Chris Abani ranks right up there with Chinua Achebe and Wole Soyinka in my book. He peels away the glossy shell of life and dives right into the soft underbelly where life and death compete side by side.   Graceland took my breath away with its vivid rendering of Lagos and Nigeria, it's compassionate protagonist, and its heartfelt stuggle to do more than merely survive.  Abani writes with such passion and insight that I was easily swept away with every sentence.   I used to work in Nigeria, and it all came rushing back to me with this book - the sights, the sounds, the smells, the pace . . .  it's all there. Raucous music mingling with car horns. Burning tires overpowering the barbeque chicken. Palm wine and beer. Overfilled jitneys. Waterlogged slums. Bar Beach Market.   I have read this book twice already and am still not tired of it. In addition, I've read his poetry in "Daphne's Lot" and "Kalakuta Republic" and found them to be as melodic and memorable as "Graceland."   I definitely recommend that you buy and read this book. It will earn a place in your heart and your top ten fiction list.+books

Why I'm buying this book+P+So I'm sitting in a West Village cafe opposite a beautiful young writer, and she's friends with a guy named Eli Cooper who seems to be living a dream life as a children's book author. He's just written his first non-watercolor-painted book on fatherhood, she has it, and don't I want to check it out?  I don't know if I do. Will I be jealous of his writing? Should I trust this review by this other guy? Parenthood isn't something I'm rushing into. Even a book about it raises my heartbeat. (I'm married but childless. For now.)  Reading the first two chapters floors me instantly. This is not at all what I expected. How do you make fresh what so many other people have tried to write? Well, this Elisha guy succeeds. Mr. Cooper writes with such a natural tone it's like listening to an old friend just kind of chuckling over the phone. At the same time, his observations are sharp, cutting, and hilarious. This is the good stuff. I'm buying it. Go get it!+books

2nd in genealogy mystery series.  Fun read!+P+Bloodline by Fiona Mountain is the second book in the Natasha Blake genealogist mystery series.  After an elderly man hires Natasha to investigate the family background of his granddaughter's fiance, he is mysteriously murdered.  The man's son hires Natasha to find out why.  Mountain does a much better job this time of connecting with the reader.  Natasha's connections to her friends and family deepen and develop as well.  There are loads of subplots, including Natasha's insomnia which occasionally makes her take actions that had me shaking my head in disbelief.  The story takes an unexpected dark turn as Natasha finds out that sometimes finding the answers to questions only creates more questions with answers no one wants to hear.  This was a fun read that made me think a bit too.  I look forward to the next in the series.+books
Ugh...+N+I usually like Deaver's stories, but I actually only made it through half of the book...then tossed the thing. I am not crazy about the subject matter when it involves children (even if they are at the teen stage). Should have paid more attention to the info at the back of the book. And I definitely don't need to have obscenities every sentence. My mother always stated that people who swore constantly had nothing of interest to say. I find this to be true, even in my choice of literature. My time on this earth is too short to waste reading this type of material.   So I am a prude...  Karen Sadle+books
Behind Every Great Woman...+P+IMPERIAL WOMAN is the fictionalized biography of the great Dowager Empress Tzu Hsi, the real power behind the throne during the reins of the last four emperors of China. The story starts with her as a beautiful Manchu teenager who, along with her cousin Sakota, is picked for the emperor's crop of concubines. Through guile and ambition, Tzu Hsi bears the male heir to the emperor she comes to control. When the emperor dies young, Tzu Hsi makes sure she and Sakota are named regents for the young child emperor.   Through keen intelligence, intrigue, and whatever other means necessary, Tzu Hsi holds the imperial throne through her son's childhood. Buck portrays a woman split between feelings of love for her family and what is the best for the empire, rather than what I gather is the historical feeling - that Tzu Hsi was some sort of evil spider spinning schemes from the center of her web in Forbidden City. Through all the machinations and years she is aided by Jung Lu, her former betrothed and the love of her life.   The Dowager Empress has the ultimate power, but Buck shows she is a servant of the opinions of her court advisors and in reality only rules the eunuchs and court ladies in the Forbidden City. She is a relic of the past in a time of great change and cultural upheaval in China, when it is besieged by western nations and ideas. The infamous Boxer Rebellion is the beginning of the end for Tzu Hsi, and she loses her spirit and resolve after this defeat and the death of her beloved Jung Lu.   +books
a complex tale of labor and strife, told with efficiency+P+After "L'Assommoir" and "Nana," I was accustomed to Zola's "naturalist" style of reporting the details and constructing a story to make a point about Second Empire society. But "Germinal" surpasses those two, mainly due to Zola's efficiency. Middle-class readers in his day were likely to have invested more time than contemporary readers in reading (no search engines or video games in the late 19th century), so it's understandable why "Germinal" is so saturated with detail. That being noted, this is a masterfully written and passionate book that makes for fast reading. Zola is at his best evoking the coal elevator, the movements of an enraged crowd, the gossiping wives of miners, etc., giving the reader a clear description of the sights, sounds and smells of the moment.  A few reviewers have interpreted this is a tale of oppresive capitalism. While much of symbolism (the mine that eats the workers, the sufferings of Catherine and so on) could give that impression, this is story of disasterous ideology. Set in 1866-1867, when the Civil War in the U.S. exacerbated the coal industry's overcapitalization in France, Etienne falls in love with the proto-socialist movement (instead of Catherine) and sets off catastrophe. The episode in which Etienne, Chaval and Catherine wait underground for their rescuers is a potent metaphor for his relationship with the miners.    There are a number of very interesting characters in this book, who evolve to the decaying situations around them and often end up doing some very shocking things. Sprinkled with references to Darwin, "Germinal" features multiple characters that seems to revert to animal-like behavior. Whether Zola was not into economic progress as some suggest here is debatable, but there can be no mistake that he wanted to show the tremendous sacrifices that are involved. The change to the timbering rules by the company, the charge by the miners to Jean-Bart, and the act of sabotage by the Souvarine all have their disasterous unintended consequences. And it has been unintended consequences that defeated Marxism. In this way Zola was prophetic.  Chaval is mostly portrayed as a cruel man who represents the natural urges that Etienne constantly battles. A very good website by a professor at Washington State mentioned that "Chaval" resembles "cheval," which means "horse." So the practicality, beast-of-the-mines existence of Chaval is linked by name to the very sympathetic horses in this story. In this way Chaval is a fully-developed character in "Germinal."  Does this book have contemporary interpretations? During the week that I read this, there were two newspaper stories about coal mining. One in the weekend Milwaukee paper, told of a labor shortage in American coal mines, where in Pennsylvania and Ohio, veteran miners are returning to the towns they once had to leave. Soon afterward, the N.Y. Times described a tragic collapse in a coal mine in the central Henan province of China, showing a picture of thin, grey-clad family members crowding a building next to the entrance to the mine, waiting for names of the survivors and the still missing. Given the (capitalist) history of the U.S. and the (Communist) history of China, would Zola be surprised by the content of these two newspaper stories in 2004?   Coal mining in the U.S., of course, is a segment of the economy of which many environmentalists disapprove; its fate may be decided by the upcoming presidential election. Zola's "Germinal" is a masterpiece (I enjoyed the translation by Leonard Tanock), but its lessons may not be as simple as some readers may hope.  +books
try this without sound or sub-titles+P+Yes, I have seen Seventh Seal many times, and it is, indeed, stark.  The other night I watched the new Criterion DVD I was gifted with the lights out, the sound off and volumes one and two of Coil's 'Music to listen to in the dark' popped in the stereo. I mean, once one has once seen Seventh Seal, there is nothing to the plot. (I won't say that of the dialog because I don't speak Swedish.) It's like Oedipus Rex.  This is a Swedish movie. Everyone in it looks Swedish. (Even death). Death is beyond anything from Bill and Ted, yet (without Seventh Seal) would we even have Bill and Ted?  I just like to watch these Swedish people talk. Perhaps the longest scene in the movie is shot on a beach, the horizon at mid-screen, and the entire top of the screen contains a horse, stamping, moving about, never still for but a moment. It is imagery that takes your breath away. As an image it is more than I could ever hope for, incomprehensible and compelling. Add Max Van Sydow, and, well, whatever! It's not a movie that you should intend to understand. It's just beauty to watch and think about later. Maybe always+books

Great Book For Interested Physics Students+P+When reading books about Chemistry or Physics, the level of depth is usually to the electron, proton, neutron, and there is usually some mention of quarks and antimatter and dark matter, but with no explanation of where these ideas are coming from. This book gives a good, nonmathematical description of the Standard Theory (Model) of particle physics, which gives a good account of what particles are known, how forces are treated using particles called Bosons. The books will answer any questions about what is known, but without proofs. I plan to study physics as an undergrad, and probably grad too, and have always been attracted to learning about the fundamental particles. This book was very satisfying for me, and will be for other interested students. Kane provides information about not only the standard theory, but also the facilities where research is done, where the field is going, and what a future student can expect. A quick read and definitely worth the time+books
This is a phenomenal book+P+Missing Measures is a great book. Steele is a remarkable scholar. The book is well researched and written in a style that is easy to understand as well as being a very enjoyable book. It's of interest to anyone who enjoys poetry, formal or not. This is a great text in literary history/criticism. And it is important for those who want to understand the Modernist movement+books

Feels like a dutiful summary+N+First, my background: I am not a mathematician, but an academic with fair knowledge of college math and even some advanced materials. I do greatly enjoy reading books about mathematics and mathematicians.   This book is obviously a work of great effort by the author. My difficulty probably came from the work's ambitious premise: offering mathematical and biographical history of Hilbert's problems. There are simply too many ideas and persons (some well known, others a bit obscure to lay reader like myself) to cover in one book.  The author dutifully and honestly gives references to his sources. My impression is that the author collected as much material as he could about each problem and solvers, and tried to squeeze the information as compactly as possible into the pages.  The result: the narrative is very methodically told - explanation of the problem, some necessary ideas introduced, who the major solvers were, then a short biography of each solver, when and where they were born, who their parents were, where they went to school, who they married and so on; then another cycle begins. Halfway into the book, I began to get bored.   I can imagine mathematicians enjoying a quick review of and glimpses into their discipline and heroes, but lay readers much beware. I recommend lay readers to check out a few pages  carefully online or at your local library to see whether you like it. I certainly didn't hate it but did not like it as much as I expected+books

A tragic disappointment+N+I couldn't get through this book. I managed to read through the first 5 chapters before getting really irritated at all of the grammatical and spelling errors. It is as if the author did not have anyone edit her work before submitting it to be published. And since it was published by IUniverse, I shouldn't have been that surprised. Also, I was constantly detracted by the overuse and inappropriate use of adjectives, metaphors and cliched phrases. The one thing this book had going for it was the plot. The prologue was the only thing that I would consider decently written in the entire novel. There are glaring disrepencies throughout the novel that absolutly could not be ignored. The characters switch back and forth so much you cannot get a grasp as to who they really are. Because of this they seem supremely superficial. This book came across as being very quickly written as there are so many jumps from scene to scene and very obvious contradictions that it was really difficult for me to get as far as I did. Do not waste your money on this book. The plot isn't good enough to make up for the terrible writing+books
Don't waste your money+N+This book is a complete watse of time for the educated strength and conditioning coach.

Could be better.+P+The flashcards are nice to take anywhere. The numbers are lined to different parts of the region one is studying. Example the skull, if you are studying lateral view of the skull a number would highlight the temporal bone but you will have four lines pointing to four different parts of the temporal bone, if you needed more help to which part of the temporal bone was the zygomatic process it would be hard to find out which of those four lines pointed to it. The answers are next to the temporal bone in parenthesis but it does not go in to much detail to which line represents what. This could be better+books
Good, but not one of the better Andy Carpenter stories+P+A good fun book but not as good as some of the author's prior efforts.  Kenny Schilling, a football player in an "O.J." type standoff with the cops is accused of murdering another player.  He wants Andy Carpenter to defend him.  Kenny has no recollection of what happened while the murder took place, just like one of Andy's prior clients (remember "Open and Shut").  Andy takes on the case and seems to change his theory as to what transpired almost every 50 pages of the book.  Hidden in the background of the story is his relationship with Laurie, who has an irresistible offer that would involve breaking up with Andy.  You need to wait till almost the end of the book to find out the outcome (unless you already had a sneak peak into the author's next book).  Though the book is better than a lot of courtroom thrillers out there it is slow the first 150-200 pages (the book is only about 300 pages) and Andy seems to not be as sharp witted and interesting as he was in the author's prior works.  Also, the author tries to fake out the reader twice with resolutions but both times there are still a lot of pages to go and so unresolved fine details (reminiscent of the movie "Taking Lives") that the reader is far from fooled.  This book should be read but you should start with the author's first book ("Open and Shut") before getting to it.+books
For the philosopher of mind, this is THE start of the road.+P+*disclaimer: I am writing this as a philosopher of mind so any parts of the book or chapters not related to this are not what I am addressing.*    I do not mean to say that Bennett and Hacker have all the answers, but their "ordinary language" approach, along with their debt to Wittgenstein, Ryle, Kenny and Strawson, says something about their book.  Most contemporary philosophers of mind (Sprague, Strawson and Hacker, among others, excluded) have rightly dismissed the soul, but have decided that there is something "mysterious" about consciousness, or perception or emotion, or what have you.  In response, Bennett and Hacker have shown what "consciousness" really is: the conscious acts of people existing in the world.  This is why we know that other people are conscious actors: they do conscious things such as watch birds, or play chess, or eat ham sandwiches.    If Michael Tye's or David Chalmers' or Colin McGinn's problems of consiousness (e.g. that I can know that you feel the same pain that I feel, or that you see the same color that I see) are indeed problems for you, you should read this book; if it doesn't prove to you that they are not problems at all, at least it will give you a new way of looking at the problems so that you may come to your own interesting conclusions+books
Unsuitable for undergraduates+N+The original Mechanical Engineering Design book written by Joseph Shigley, and later, with Larry Mitchell, was an excellent undergraduate text; it was readable at the introductory level, and it contained enough information and methodology for use as a good reference book after graduation.  Unfortunately, this revised text, which was rewritten by Charles Mischke, is thoroughly unreadable, obfuscating, and is totally unsuitable as a text for undergraduate mechanical engineering students.  The book is full of nuances, subtleties and informative data that do make it useful as a reference book on the shelf of an experienced design engineer, but not as a text for students learning the subject.  For those who plan to teach a course for mechanical engineering majors on this topic, I recommend other texts such a Jack Collins' Mechanical Design of Machine Elements and Machines, Wiley, 2003+books
Great for me, but 40 years late+P+This is an execellent book. On the downside i'm 72 years old so i should have read this 40 years ago.   The author is clear & it's readable for most anyone.   However i think today's readers may find the material dated, with some cliche's that were probably very "hip" in the mid '60's. Yet today i beleive we can con verese with most anyone & arrive at these type mind games on our own without the need of a therapist.     If i were able to time travel back to the '60s, Woodstock, Timothy Leary,...& read this book with "that" mind-set, i would rate the book 5 big stars+books
get to really know your cards+P+First, I must say that the previous reviewer shuns the author's decision to include other books as recommended reading, yet I find that when an author does this, they are helping the reader truly expand on the subject, and it shows that the author is secure enough to not feel that their way is the only way.  This book has been THE most helpful book for me to learn the Tarot, and about myself and friends/family.  There's a bit of numerology in it, and some lessons that are fun to do, at the same time, these teach more about the cards.  I would recommend this book to novices and skilled alike+books
Kroeger endorses "one drop" myth+N+Kroeger's selection of David Matthews as a supposed "passer" is racist.  Matthews, unlike the other subjects of this book, was truly "passing" for what he really was.  He was born of a Jewish mother and has predominately white ancestry.  That qualifies him to call himself both a "Jew" and a "white."  Kroeger implies that he isn't good enough to be either.  For the other side of this "passing" issue, read:  "Passing" For Who You Really Are: Twelve Essays in Support of Multiracial Whiteness  http://www.backintyme.com/Ad222.htm  http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0939479222/backintyme-20/103-3968075-455503+books

A  great interesting book+P+The Great Kapok Tree is about saving the rain forest. First a man starts to cut down a tree in the rain forest with an ax. Whack, whack, whack!  The sounds of the ax hitting the tree scared the animals.  One by one they came down to where the man was, but the man fell asleep. A boa constrictor came down from the canopy of the tree and hissed in the man's ear, "Senhor, this tree is a tree of miracles. It is my home, where generations of my ancestors have lived. Do not chop it down."  I liked this story because it is about the rain forest.   The pictures were good, too.   +books
You would think our own would know the score. +N+No one with a true understanding of Billie Holiday would consider her a Blues Singer.  As such to truly study Blues Legacies, it would be better if a Blues singer like Memphis Minnie, one of the greatest female instrumental blues singers, were included. Surely, Dinah Washington, justifiably named the Queen of the Blues, or Ruth Brown, (Miss or maybe now Ms Rhythm) would be more appropriate to a study of Black blues women.    This hints that the generalizations in this book may be the result of pushing around reality rather than studying it. This is an all too frequent problem in the writing of academics who seem more concerned about creating their own little niche of analysis, than situating their work in the realities of life, culture, and art where the blues or Jazz, and Billie's real life live.      Billie did not like to be called a Blues Singer.  If we are concerned with the voices of Black women, then someone involved in this book should have at least had the respect to listen to Billie Holiday's voice on the matter.  She considered herself a Jazz singer and later a cabaret singer.    She recorded very few blues.  The two blues she recorded again and again "Billie's Blues" and "Fine and Mellow" were only recorded because in two different recording sessions there was time to record additional songs, but no preparation or charts existed for any song, so an easy to play blues was selected. Billie recorded them and performed these two tunes often because she had the author's credit and publishing on them which made it easier and more profitable. This is despite the fact that the exact word sets had been sung and recorded by real blues singers before Billie had the brains to record AND copyright them.  Listen to Helen Humes sing an exact version of Fine and Mellow with another name during the first Spirituals to Swing concert that took place BEFORE Billie recorded her version.           A good contrast with Billie, though male, was her friend and often colleague Jimmie Rushing who served with her in the Basie Band. Despite his penchant for claiming he was a ballad singer as well--Rushing actually thought that when Billie left Basie that rather than hiring another singer, he alone could fill the gap--Rushing's recordings with Walter Page's Blue Devils in the 1920s, with Moten in the early 1930s, and with Basie in the 1930s and 1940s are masterpieces of the blues. Many of his renditions like Good Morning Blues have become standards for blusicians of all stripes.  Lesser known but deserving more attention are his great blues recorded with KC musicians for John Hammond on Vanguard in the 1960s.    Otherwise she recorded few blues, particularly in her most artistically developed period between 1934 and 1945. Indeed,  Billie's lack of a blues repertoire and disinclination to perform blues cost her her position as female vocalist with the Count Basie Orchestra, a match made in heaven. While there were no doubt other factors involved, many Basieites especially Buck Clayton who was quite close to Billy have said Billie was replaced because she didn't perform enough blues to suit John Hammond who acted as de facto manager and AR man with the Basie band.  Hammond replaced Billie Holiday with Helen Humes who had been recording blues for ten years before she joined Basie.  Humes, of course, continued to record Blues with Basie, and then as an independent singer from  then until her death keeping her magnificent jump blues alive for several generations of listeners.  Clayton's complaint is a standard one leveled at white Jazz producers like Hammond and Norman Grantz that they wanted blues, not more harmonically developed music that Black Jazz musicians really wanted to play.        The blues is a specific genre of African American musical, poetic, and cultural expression with its own distinct history, evolution, and practices.  Simply collapsing every  Black performer into the Blues makes the blues meaningless and demeans the work of the millions of women and men who have created the blues in the last 110-120 years.        Another insult to Billie, is the tendency to see her as a "blues figure" because of her "tragic" life.  This is the tendency to evaluate Billie as the public life disaster that she tended to milk in desperation in the last years of her life symbolized by the fake autobiography _Lady Sings the Blues_.  This contrasts than the artistic consideration she deserved and received from other musicians and singers.  She was a competent and practicing jazz artist, raised in the music business (her father complained he played guitar for every jazz artist in NYC in the 1930s and early 1940s but Billie.  Her mother boarded musicians and catered musical parties). From a young age, Billie was considered as knowledgeable as the top instrumentalists of the music by those top instrumentalists.  Those who rely on the "tragedy" to induct Billie into the Blues express a greater ignorance given that as her own drug addiction advanced, her music had less and less of a connection with the blues, climaxing in "The Lady in Satin" which is a vain attempt to take The Lady into non-Jazz pop. All of her original blues were recorded in her pre-heroin youth in the 1930s, not in the 1950s when Billie's self-made "tragedy" had begun to destroy her voice and musicial viability and then her life.   It is quite bizarre for anyone to claim Billie's performance of Meeropol's song "Strange Fruit," has any relationship to blues music given her very straight reading of the tune, the unblueslike straight minor it is given, and the unjazzlike accompaniment. If one wants to see what a Blues Singer can do to this song, one needs to listen to the astounding version recorded by Josh White which is blusey and also more dramatic and satisfying than Holiday's more celebrated version.  Holiday's performance of "Strange Fruit," tends to be elevated by folks for the justifiable political message the song provided and the controversy involved.  However, an honest or even rational evaluation of the performance seems to be unavailable these days.  This raises yet another ignorance, the outsider's view that "The Blues" is always sad or "tragic."  The immense body of the most popular blusicians--that is blues artists that Black people listened to-- of the 1930s like Memphis Minnie, Tampa Red, and Leroy Carr served up a bunch of pretty happy, often double entendre, blues. Blues music was overwhelmingly dance music, with performers not playing the three minute blues contemporary white blues wannabe's deduce from recordings, but 10 to even 30 minute versions of their songs for dancers from Juke Joints to the big ballrooms. Unfortunately, people who have never studied the blues as a real genre, misplace it as the solo moaning of the "existential Negro," rather than the jumping music of a century of African American Saturday nights.                 As an African American performer of the blues and other Black traditional musics as well as a scholar of African American music tradition, this kind of non scientific, non-traditional, grab bag sloppiness about our music and our culture is a sign that even among our own, the outsider's false generalizations about the blues reign.  You would think our own would know the score.  +books
Always check the LANGUAGE NOTES  before buying a book+P+I can't believe the only 2 bad reviews were given by people who din't know the book was written in Spanish.  I read the book and I personally give it 10 stars for its historic content among other things.  First, the TITLE is written in SPANISH, not German nor ENGLISH!!!  Second, if you feel the vendor didn't provide an accurate description of the book such as the Language Edition don't blame the book. Further, if you want to blame somebody because you can't read the book, blame the editors for not publishing an English version. NOT ALL BOOKS are translated into ENGLISH and viceversa.  Third, for those who wrote the bad reviews give yourself 20 stars for publicly admitting that you were careless/stup.. enough to buy a book that you couldn't read. UNDER THE EDITORIAL REVIEWS you have this NOTE:  Language Notes Text: Spanish   I hope this note helps for those would be buyers.  GRACIAS.   +books
Good general nutritional ideas gone amuck+N+Contains many well corroborated general guidelines regarding improved diet and nutrition. However, the author often takes these guidelines to the extreme. Discerning readers will carefully consider his recommendations before implementing them. Yes, cooking in microwave ovens probably should be avoided especially by health compromised people but they are very much in use in Russia today- they were reinstated ten years before the copyright date. And I doubt that microwave ovens render meat protein useless. Also, Dr. Young seems to have too many proprietary interests which of course raise questions about potential conflicts of interest and, therefore, the validity of his dietary claims.   I tried to confirm a few of his stated "facts" by trying them myself;I could not. Use common sense when you read about corn, peanuts, and mushrooms.  I am juicing green vegetables daily and love it. I expected more from a Ph.D.  +books
Great drawing book+P+Way better than most art books,  Covers so many necessary points.  The author has a great website too+books
the worst book ever+N+I read this book for school, my sister said it would get better, but it turned out to be the worst book I've ever read. I rest my case.+books
Excellent, Informative!+P+Keeping it brief, this is a great book with tons of interesting facts about mysteries that are in the Bible. Explanations of miracles, detailed history surrounding them. I learned an intense amount of information in this book. You don't have to be a scholar, as it was written simply. The authors did an excellent job+books
don't know what I'd do without it!+P+I'm a science copyeditor, and I truly don't know how I'd manage without this book. If it has to do with chemistry, it's here (thank heaven!). And there's a wealth of clear information about how to format math, a wonderful list of unit abbreviations, and even a fair amount about physics- and biology-related terminology. It has the most lucid and concise explanations I've seen about when to apply italics or roman. And it's reasonably priced. Of course, if you specifically need to follow ACS style, this book is de rigeur, but even if you don't, you'll find it invaluable for science copyediting+books
Very disappointing+N+Good concept, title, and cover... but lacking good pictures. Any most pictures are very small. Lots of good writing, though+books
Best I've seen+P+Nice edition of this work.  Has good footnotes, and contains much besides the poem itself, including information on Milton's life, and a section on sources that Milton used, and "classic" and modern criticism of the work.  +books
Nothing That's Not In Other Books+N+There's nothing in this book that isn't in many other photography books.  Much of the book is taken up with definitions and discussion of equipment and techniques, rather than approaches to creativity (as is implied by the sub-title of the book).  The photos are far from inspiring.  I didn't learn anything from this book+books
Preposterous!+N+This book begins with the absurd claim that 'the natural numbers -1, 2,3, 4 etc- appear to have been present at the birth of the universe; part and parcel of the original material from which was knit the ever-expanding continuum of space-time.' The author does not explain in whose mind these numbers are supposed to have appeared or how a concept can be present without a mind to concieve it. Like many mathematicians he seems unable to grasp that mathematics is a language. Thus it's not uncommon to hear ridiculous statements like 'the universe is governed by mathematics' As if numbers exert forces. But this is the first time I've encountered the claim that numbers existed prior to life!  +books
Pick a Different Book+N+What Tedd Tripp has to say may be true, but he says it without warmth, humor or compassion.  If you're looking for a good book on parenting from a Christian perspective, pick up a book by Dr. James Dobson, Dr. Kevin Leman, or Gary Chapman+books
Grade school mental workout!!!+P+This book is the best of its kind--nothing comes close to the number and variety of mental puzzles of various levels of difficulty...word games, optical tricks, math puzzles, et cetera. This book is amazing. I've given several to teachers. Excellent for third grade up to high school. The only thing I'd change about the book is the color: the book only has black, white, gray and blue+books
A Thrilling tale of Music History at it's finest+P+Dr. Glinsky managed to write a complete factual book and yet have all the action and suspense that you would commonly find in an espionage novel+books
The Final chapter...or is it?+P+This is a book you expected Massie to write.....since Nicholas & Alexandra was written in (I think) 1969, an update since 1991 was critical. It gives you an idea what was being discovered in DNA research and proving the bones found were who they were. Its a book a Romanov observer should have, or at least read to glean the information from. Worth it, for sure.+books
great book!+P+This is a good book for starters like me. It gives you insight about the market, how it behaves and it also discusses the important history in the financial market+books
Historical fiction at its very best.+P+Though this is a long read (not to be undertaken in one sitting---at least by those without some background in the region/culture) it is well worth it should you wish to cultivate an understanding of Russia & Eastern Europe.  The novel is very true to historical detail, and although many of its characters are of course fictionalized, Rutherford has clearly gone to painstaking lengths to remain historically correct---far moreso than most "historical" novels.  Reading "Russka" will leave you with a true sense of a people and how they have evolved historically & culturally over the span of centuries.  I am a professor & I used this book with one of my classes as assigned reading, with sections of "Russka" paired with corresponding sections of a Russian history book with truly wonderful results---rather than griping about the reading load as usual, most students loved the book and via the novel & the pairing with the text, they seemed to learn a great deal.  Addendum (Feb 16).  Those folks who have criticised the book should perhaps view the book in the right light.  It is not intended to be nor should it be used as a text book or scholarly treatise---though it would be a wonderful and creative suppliment for the latter.  It is a very well crafted and meticulously well researched historical NOVEL and in accuracy of detail it is far superior to most (e.g. some of Michener's "historical" novels contain egregious innacuracies+books
My son loves this series!+P+These books are great for kids who are reading early chapter books -- they're not terribly long, but they're quite creative.  My son loves them+books
Defeatist treatise on the process of canon formation+N+Harold Bloom, borrowing the metaphors and terminology of psychoanalysis, interprets the poet's relation to tradition in terms of an agonistic Oedipal struggle, arguing that the ("belated") poet's literary productions result from a conflict with a "strong" father figure with whom he must compete through a number of rhetorical phases representative of the "repression" of his own poetic self and the strong misreading (or "misprision", as Bloom calls it) of the work of a predecessor. Bloom's conception of the "canon" is a hierarchical, continuous and genealogical model of direct succession, as the young apprentice to the craft of literature subjects himself to self-imposed austerities, ridding himself of prematurely smug complacency, opening his text to the strong aura of the canon, and testing his productions against it. However, Bloom's argument is undercut by his own acknowledgement that many great writers can afford to nevertheless produce great literature by debunking the whole issue of influence, belatedness and originality, and allowing their works to flow forth from them spontaneously. This admission risks making the importance of the canon altogether trivial. Another difficulty is the understanding of many writers that the ideas of &quot;influence&quot; and &quot;tradition&quot; can entirely do away with the idea of belatedness, for the poet cannot be belated in a world of which he or she can still have an impact through writing and teaching. Bloom's defeatist reliance on canonical precedents, and his implicit regard that new writers have arrived too late in history to produce truly original works, reflects the postmodern &quot;fin-de-millennium&quot; langour that all sources of inspiration have been exhausted, and that we must abandon all hope of creating new works, but merely repeat the past. Not only are his conclusions totally untenable, but his whole treatise, on its insistence on returning to canonical precedents, fails to provide for a more dynamic, more forward-moving (as opposed to reversing, revising and troping) theory of poetry, a theory capable of affirming life and history more fully. It would be interesting to discover what Bloom would make of Henry Adams's remark: "Everything is respectable and nothing amusing. There are no outlaws.+books
A blessing to all reader+P+It takes me a long time to finish this book.  I just could not stop going back to the previous chapters, reflected on it and amazed by the insight and spiritual depth of Nouwen.  I read it in bed times, and in the subway.   Whenever I go into the lines, my spirit was lifted up high, thanking God  who let me know myself and Him more.  The 3 movements: from loneliness to  solitude; hostility to hospitality; illusion to prayer  are all essential  elements of the answer to the question &quot;how to live a spirit-filled  life in the name of Jesus Christ&quot;. Each sections are as wonderful and  unmissable as the others. This book gave me a brand new dimension of  understanding on &quot;Christian's spiritual life&quot;, on caring and  interacting with others and on the nature of our Almighty God.  I was so  impressed that I spent several nights translating around 10 pages in the  second part into Chinese and read it in my church fellowship.  I thank Him  again and again for leading me to read this+books
Interesting outlook on what angels do for ordinary folks.+P+This author always has a unique look at religious views. Practical applications and a lot of stories illustrating what the angels have done for folks. No scientifc proof but the author freely and upfront says so. I like this author and have had positive experiences using some of her instructions. If for no other reason her ideas do no harm and are very good for stress and the everyday worries we all have. I enjoy her books and you can read in one gulp or piecemeal and still come away with a different perspective than you started+books
fuzzy-bunny liberalism breaks rank with reality+N+Although I agree with several of Mr. Stamper's recommendations (legalizing prostitution, decriminalizing drugs), many of his assertions are straight out of the "I-Hate-America" handbook.  All white, male cops -and even many black ones - are racsist, homophobic, women-hating thugs.  What we need is a kinder, gentler way of policing.        Mr. Stamper had a brief career as a police officer before his real career of supervisory bureacrat began.  He "confesses" that in his rookie year he was on his way to becoming one of the bad cops before he was set right by a straight-shootin' DA.  It was apparently then that his liberal sensitivities kicked in, and soon he was a supervisor (all the better to control the average Joe).        The unfortunate thing about this book isn't the stories he relates, or even his recommendations (some good, some not so good), but the haughty way in which he relates it.  Conservatives, Republicans - BAD! Liberals, Democrats - GOOD! (except for unions - bad!)  If this book were written with respect not only for the majority of rank and file cops, but for the other half of Americans that Mr. Stamper obviously disdains, it may have been worth the money.  As it is, if you are to the right of Hillary, take a pass on this one+books
Unhelpful and Outdated+N+I'm glad that I got this book out from the library instead of buying it. It provides extremely conventional advice about self-esteem and makeup, and the clothes the author suggests for teens seem like they're straight from the 80's. I really don't know anyone who wears scarves, overalls, or blouses to school. The language and general writing style of the author also seems outdated. I actually checked the publishing date to see if this was a 90's book; it's a 2000 book. Ms. Youngs even uses the 80's spring/summer/autumn/winter system of choosing clothing and makeup colors. It's also annoying that the book encourages confidence in one's looks and "beauty diversity", yet has photos mostly of stereotypical blonde-haired-blue-eyed all-american-girls. The author herself was a Miss Teen Claifornia finalist, so I suppose one couln't expect much more. I would avoid buying this for a young girl, or avoid buying it for yourself if you are a young girl+books
Junie B. Jones Collection: Books 17-20+N+I gave this only one star as I didn't actually read it. I thought I was ordering books for my grand-daughter, but it turned out to be audio tapes. I paid over $12. for it, but was only refunded $7. Extra fees were added that weren't there when I purchased.  I wrote to Amazon about not wanting a refund, but wanting the actual books, I got NO RESPONSE. I will never order from Amazon again, I am very disappointed with the way this was handled+books
Be the best you can be....+P+Noe has hit the nail on the head with his exceptional presentations and breakdowns of employee development (My reason for choosing this book.) His explanations of the need for the companies to become competitive and how to achieve it with traditional and cutting edge approaches makes this a must  read.  The reasons for training, how to do a needs assessment, and get  employees to be the best they can be, becomes obtainable with his step by  step processes.  Go for it.  You won't regret it+books
Another Great Indian Con being lapped up by the world...+N+Let me start by explaining the title of my review: being an Indian (settled in India, not outside) I am incessantly perplexed by the plethora or completely rubbish books from India which the West just can't seem to get enough of. Books which say nothing about India, and are not about it. Just books set in India, which throw in some curry and some local language, and somehow thus make people fall all over themselves in an attempt to praise the book. My gut revolts against such partisanship, and this is one of those books which is a perfect example of this rubbish trend, and hence is going to get such deserving treatment at my hands.  But let me start by going back a bit in time and giving credit where it's due: after reading his first two books, I came to the very early conclusion that Vikram Chandra was the narrator's Narrator, a storyteller of uncommon brilliance, a weaver of magic tales. On the flip side, like most other Chandra fans, I too was frustrated by his ability to end every one of his stories in the worst all of all possible ways; but I loved his craft nonetheless. I had almost convinced myself that with his next book, I'd stop about 10% before the end of the book, and with Sacred Games, that promise turned out to be very easy to fulfill - I managed to put the book down without dying of guilt about halfway through itself.  Sacred Games is a book about nothing: there are no characters who feel real, it is not about the protagonists' environment, it doesn't rotate around or shed new light on any events, and it doesn't deal with any objects of fascination. Nothing. Nil. Zilch. Nada. A lot of people have talked about this as another of the, if not the definitive Bombay book, but having lived there myself, I can vouch for the fact that this book doesn't even begin to capture an iota of the character or the essence of Bombay. (If you really want to read about the city, read "Shantaram" - now that's a book!) In fact, I think one of the lowest points of the book is how it fails to create any context - the events of this book could almost have happened anywhere, at almost any point in time. (And no, that does not make it timeless - just outright insipid.) Simple mechanisms like linkages to some real-life events would have given the reader something to hold on to - but no, Mr. Chandra refuses to give any straws to the drowning. Reviewers have gone ga-ga over it's portrayal of the Bombay Mafia, but there is nothing said here which is even remotely new, and there isn't the slightest different twist to it. Dons, corrupt policemen, actors, dancing girls, slums, and smuggling - everything has been told, and told much better.   A stunningly stupid highlight of this book is the copious usage of local language without any glossary to help the readers understand what the terms mean. I have almost been a local there, and though I understood most of the local or slang language, there were terms which bewildered even me. I understand that Mr. Chandra believes that this deliberate omission of explanations draws you into the story, but when there are 10 or more such words per page, it will leave a lot of readers more irritated than intrigued.  Overall, I would strongly recommend avoiding this book. The Indians because there is nothing here that you don't know or can't read about in a better written book, and the rest because this is not about India -it's just a forced nowhere story. Save your money and your time. Go buy or read something else.+books
what's the real price to our society?+N+Lent to me 'cause I'm such a mystery fan.  But I couldn't get over the fact that Anne Perry is herself a convicted murderer and if I bought her books I'd be contributing to her profit off her murder.    From Time: "When mystery writer Anne Perry was 15, she committed murder. She and her friend, Pauline, killed Pauline's mother. Perry served 5 1/2 years in an adult women's prison. After her release, she left New Zealand and has never returned. Now living in Scotland, Perry has fashioned a new life and a successful career. Although family and close friends knew about Perry's past, it was never known to the general public, including her agent and her U.S. publisher. The New Zealand film, Heavenly Creatures, deals with the 1954 case. A New Zealand reporter uncovered Perry's previous identity as Juliet Hulme. Perry insists she does not remember specifics of the actual crime."  Watch the documentary "Heavenly Creatures" for the facts.  It's just gross that she got off so light for murder and is now rich because she writes about how to committ murders.  She's not wise, she's opportunistic+books

Staple for designers+P+I am thrilled with this book. It is clear, concise, and thorough. I'm totally excited to make all the slopers to begin creating my own library of designs. Content-wise the only drawbacks is that it's mostly based on standard form sizes. They do give directions about how to measure the body and the drafting itself is pretty simply explained so either measurements can be used. Also, there aren't instructions about collars or cuffs or button/zipper extensions which, granted, are not really necessarily drafted by measurements. But you do need a supplemental Flat pattern making book for those items.  The only real cons I can tell are the publisher's fault - not the author's. The book is rather skinny for the price - I too was expecting a monster text. Should have known better - its a textbook right? so of course they gouge the student. Shameless really. On top of it, it is rather cheaply done - the pages look like photocopies!  Also, one reviewer mentioned that it came with the neckline tool - I didn't get one! Now I have to scour the internet to find a replacement because they don't have directions about how to draft a neckline. My only real annoyance.+books

Sinks like a stone, stinks like a monkey+N+This is the first book by Deaver that I have read.  Apparently there are a couple of prequels to this novel involving the same main characters -- I will never read them.  Deaver has adequate style and a talent for pacing a mystery thriller.  He also has some skill in character development; however, he only applies this skill to the secondary characters in this story.  Perhaps the main characters in this story appeared so flat to me because I have not read the other novels in this series, but judging by their inconsistent behavior, bizarre motivations, and the melodramatic dialogue in this novel I doubt the other books could be much better.  Worse than Deaver's hackneyed mystery cut-out-characters is his insistence that the reader be willing to accept the most unbelievable and unlikely situations for the sake of a dramatic situation or plot twist.  Like many other second-drawer mystery writers, Deaver portrays such notable organizations as the FBI, INS, US Coast Guard, and the NYPD as ridiculously inept and corruptible.  Nor has he made any attempt to research the actual policies and procedures that these organizations would follow in the situations presented in the story.  Deaver also has a poor grasp on the politics of international economics.  This is normally excusable in a mystery writer, but since Deaver sets Chinese/American economics as the foundation of his final plot twist the whole story comes crashing down in the final chapters of the novel.       A note to Deaver and other mystery writers:  it is not a requirement for a great detective to be a pompous jerk and an abrasive know-it-all.  It has been 115 years since Doyle introduced the world to Sherlock Holmes, and we have had 115 years of mediocre mystery writers plagiarizing Doyle's character.  Please try to be original.   And also, if the final "twist" in your story is so complicated and so unbelievable that you must expend two chapters in trying to explain it, perhaps it shouldn't be there in the first place.  I give this book a D.   +books
This Text is only for Advanced Studies+N+I strongly believe that this book could easily create misunderstandings to a student of Harmony. i found this book almost chaotic when I studied it as  a Harmony sudent. In comparison to Walter Piston's Harmony this book has  not a straight and organised method of teaching and I only recommend it for  advanced students+books
Excellent Writer.....Poor Plot+N+West is without a doubt a superb writer, however I found The Shoes of The Fisherman to be a great dissapointment.  In spite of the fact that most of the reviews I have read higly praise the book, it never really got to me.  The concept seems quite interesting at first:  an unknown russian, cardinal Kiril Lakota is elected pope.  After being held prisioner for quite a few years, he steps up to lead millions of people around the globe in a new world which he basically has knowledge of only from his years in captivity.  At the same time, Kamanev, the man who had been Lakota's prision guard in Russia, and who tortured him beyond belief, has become the head of the russian government.  The fact that both men now need each other provides for a very interesting plot, which in my opinion is never fully developed.  The main issue I have with the novel is that it is plotless...nothing really happens.  A large portion of the book consists of  a series of endless, and a bit boring, thoughts  from Lakota.  On the other hand, the reader is exposed to the way the catholic church funtions and thinks, which is an interesting way to humanize religion in he eyes of the reader.  There are also a series of sub-plots dealing with what Lakota has to face as a pope, regading human cruelty, poverty, and most of all politics, which could have proven to be enough for a good novel.  Unfortunatelly, the narration goes astray in many parts, which lessens one's interest in the book. Quite frankly, I had to make a great effort to finish the book, hoping that at some time it would pick up, which it never did.  As I mentioned before, West is a very good writer, but this book is in my opinion, highly overrated.  I can honestly say it never got my full atention.+books
Wooden, Didactic, and Cliched+N+My understanding of theoretical and practical physics (pick your subdiscipline) is more akin to catching a glimpse of an intricate structure in my peripheral vision than being able to read the architectural plans. But I do know a good book when I read one. Unfortunately, Gregory Benford's Cosm was not one of them. If he had wanted to explain to non-academics the differences between experimental and theoretical scientists, or to critique the workings of the scientific community, essays would have been a better milieu for the didactic opinions offered in this book. All of these are representative of the way a large proportion of academics see their work and the world, but a better novel would show the reader how these ideas impact the characters through dialogue and action.   The characters are wooden stereotypes alert to racial and sexist discriminations more reminiscent of the 1970s than what actually exists in today's universities (the novel is set in 2005). The clichés make an early appearance with "This far out from the city, people thought of quality entertainment as a six-pack of Coors and a bug zapper" (p. 8) and continue throughout.   All of this is mixed in with a bit of environmental angst as characters note suburban sprawl as an "upscale fungus" and see industrial park developments "crouched down, as if ashamed."   Benford has made modest attempts at providing glimpses of near-future technological advances.   In brief, a particle accelerator experiment of the main character, Alicia, results in the accidental creation of the Cosm, a universe which can be observed (sometimes directly, sometimes not) from inception to death throes. She is (unthrillingly) kidnapped and escapes. She displays rampant narcissism as she disregards authority and alternates between self-doubt and goddess-hood. And she finds love where she never thought to look.  +books
Some good advice, but he lost me at "obey"+N+Adams is clearly a thoughtful Christian man who cares about husbands and wives. My problem: his definition of those roles are too old-fashioned and rigid for my taste. Just so you know, I am not a liberal woman who either ignores the Bible or is ignorant of its teaching; I know the Biblical teachings on marriage and it is their instructions I disagree with Adams about. He consistently calls the wife the "helper", which diminishes the aspect of partnership that I believe marriage should be. A leader and a helper is not a partnership, it is basically one central figure and a secondary figure who helps them. Adams stresses the specialness of a helper to uplift the concept, but is apparently unaware that the role still pushes a sense of lesserness on the woman's side because, if a wife is a helper, who is she helping? The husband! The man is still the central figure and the wife is not seen as his mate, but his "helper", a moon revolving around a sun. His beliefs basically come from the age-old concept of, in regards to a wife's role, taking the Biblical word "Submit" and turning it into "obey". Honey, they're not the same. Submission, unlike obedience, can be mutual and does not always have to do with authority. The concept of marital submission, I believe, is basically to surrender to another's needs and put the other before oneself; this does not at all necessarily mean obeying! Therefore, Adam's words that the husband is never to submit to the wife were incorrect. Certainly the husband is never supposed to obey his wife, but he is clearly expected to submit to her needs. The Bible stresses the importance of the husband laying down his life for his wife if necessary; that is HUGE submission on the husband's part. Submitting to a spouse should not be a matter of one ruling over the other, but rather a matter of both spouses making sacrifices out of love and respect for each other.   Adams' words of wifely obedience were very grating to me, especially when he tried giving examples of when a wife should refuse a sinful "command" from her husband. If a husband freely commands his wife, we've got bigger problems than whether the command itself is sinful or not. Adam's advice for the wife to "respectfully" refuse a sinful command also rather threw me, since his example of a sinful command was if a husband wanted his wife to play spouse-swap with another couple. His idea of what to say to such a husband? "I must respectfully say no. You must not ask me to sin and I cannot do that." Firstly, if a husband actually had the nerve to ask his wife to do something like that (or command it, in Adams' words), he'd be lucky if a disrespectful answer was all he got. Secondly, I defy anyone to find a self-respecting wife who actually talks that way. The monotone of that robotic answer gave me the impression that Adams' taken this obedience thing a little too far. This impression was strengthened with his example of how a counselor should advise a woman who "has not been a good helper". His advice: "They (wives) must be trained to put on helpful deeds, a step many counselors overlook." Maybe counselors overlook this because the concept of training women to be obedient helpers is, rightly, obsolete for most people.   Books like these, which so rigidly define the roles of spouses, have a tendency to simultaneously overcomplicate and oversimplify marriage (not an easy thing to do, but they manage). They oversimplify marriage because they seem to believe that if women just obey and respect their husbands and if husbands just love and nurture their wives, the marriage will go swimmingly. It is NOT that simple! Marriage is not a recipe with instructions, it's a union between two people who will occassionaly have conflicting ideas, and conflicts will NOT magically vanish if one spouse always gives in to the other. This method also overcomplicates things because it stresses the idea of training women to be followers rather than just letting them be led by love and respect for their husbands and letting the rest fall into place on its own.   Every marriage is different; it should be Godly, of course, but you cannot make the roles of spouses cookie-cutter. Christian books tend to do this mainly as a result of the author taking the Bible too literally. Adams does this by saying that, because the Bible tells the husband and not the wife to love, loving is primarily the husband's job. He went on to say that, if a husband complains that there is little love in the marriage, his counselor should tell him that it's mainly his fault! Honestly, this alarmed me more than his earlier words about counselors training women to be helpers (what kind of counselors are these, anyway?). To automatically blame either spouse for a marital problem based on your personal interpretation of the Bible instead of what's actually happening in the marriage is a little scary (if a professional counselor does this, it's downright terrifying). The interpretation itself is rather skewed; the Bible stresses on women giving respect and men giving love because respect is something that most men already give naturally and love is already something that women give naturally. It does NOT mean that the husband is the only one who has to love and the wife only has to respect, so to blame a lack of love automatically on the husband is simply unfair and silly. There are plenty of women who have a hard time loving and men who have a hard time respecting; you cannot simply assume which spouse is at fault because of Biblical instructions.   This is not a bad book, but unless you view marriage in the same rigid terms as Adams, it probably won't do much for you. If it focused more on mutual love and respect rather than defining one sort of behavior for one particular spouse, it would've worked a lot better for me.+books
I followed this book for a couple of years+N+When I was a university student 14 years ago, I followed this book to the letter - 3 days in the gym every week for six months and then a split system which got me in the gym 4 days a week for another year or so.   In hindsight, it worked (as any beginner gets a little bigger anyway just by heading to the gym) but I picked up a copy of BRAWN a year later - training twice a week just focussing on the big exercises and realised far better results.    This book is good for motivation, a trip down memory lane for some; it has some good ideas but generally the routines aren't suitable for anyone training without steroids.  I wonder why Joe Weider never discussed the issue when obviously so many, if not all contributors, depended on steriods to realize their success... +books
Don't buy this book+N+I thought this book was about the autobiography of Benjamin Franklin. This is not the book I was thinking about. It was a book written by Benjamin Franklin but which is written after he wrote his famous autobiography. The book did not contain the contents of his autobiography but contains his writings that were written during his last years that was not included in his widely read autobiography.  The book title says it is 'compleated' autobiography. The book's title should be 'Last memoirs of Benjamin Frankilin+books
Must Read for Modern German History Majors!+P+I was led to reading this book for a paper I did on the civil rights of women and reasons behind women's support of the state during Hitler's reign.  Professor Koonz did a superb job of bring several elements together  to form a large, descriptive view of the lives of all women, Christian,  Jewish, Nazi, Socialist, etc. I found the interview done with Frau  Scholtz-Klink, former head of the women's department under the Nazis, one  of the most fascinating, especially since she has held on to her Nazism  when other Germans such as Hemult Kohl have renounced and apologized for  their role in Nazi Germany.  For the first time in all my studies of  Germany, I finally began to understand not only who, what and when but also  how and why the German Weimar Republic of the 1920's could accept a  dictator such as Hitler+books
Infuriating and Disappointing...+N+I wanted to read this book as lighthearted summer fun.  Instead, I found a rather dreary tale of some seriously mixed up people.  Most infuriating was the character of Tony, possibly the most arrogant, pompous, self-righteous ass who has ever graced modern literature.  And the author condones him and his behavior!  He's right, don't you see?  He's a macho guy, the omni present voice of reason and knowing what's right for everyone.  The other infuriating part of this novel is the author's treatment of Faye, the heroine.  Because she's &quot;fiesty, independent and outspoken&quot;, she is repeatedly referred to as &quot;difficult to HANDLE&quot; and &quot;a real handful&quot;.  Excuse me, but is Ms. Moore saying that women need to be &quot;handled&quot;?  Apparently so, since we're told that Faye has really &quot;met her match&quot; in this Tony loser.  I think that a man with those same characteristics would be praised as a real go-getter, aggressive and accomplished.  Why the author has strong-willed Faye succumb to Tony's blackmail and bullying is WAY beyond me.  And the way the novel ended?  COME ON!  She has made the smart, strong willed man the hero (though she tries to discuss his &quot;faults&quot; to make things appear even), and the woman very introspective and sorry for the way she is... and trying ever so hard to change.  If any man tried to bully and blackmail any smart woman into ruining her own wedding day, I'm pretty sure she'd tell him to shove it far, far up where the sun don't shine - and I can't believe that Faye didn't. A novel for the 21st century?  I don't think so.  If you love chick-lit, read the Shopaholic books or the Nanny Diaries; at least they're well written and FUNNY+books

All that glitters is not gold+N+"A long way out in the deep blue sea there lived a fish. Not just an ordinary fish, but the most beautiful fish in the entire ocean."  This is a book I have some trouble with.  It is beautifully illustrated, and the glittery silver scales make it very appealing to children. However, I am not entirely sure it is sending the right message. I like to give the author the benefit of the doubt that he meant well, that the overall message is that vanity and posessions will not make you happy.   But ultimately the solution to the Rainbow fish's problems give unclear messages, and can possibly be interpretated that to make friends you need to buy them.  Other interpretations have been covered comprehensively in other reviews and include possible biass towards communist values and a want for sameness+books
Outstanding, a comprehensive and valuable text!+P+Fumon Tanaka sensei's mastery of kobudo, iaijutsu, and jujitsu is well articulated in this excellent work. The writing is much clearer than many Asian master's first works in English. The layout is extraordinarily well done with outstanding photos and illustrations that really augment the text. Content includes budo (martial arts) history, jujutsu, kenjutsu, and samurai tradition. The nito-ken (two-sword) techniques included herein are not widely taught and rarely described in other texts. Basic, intermediate, and advanced Honmon Enshin Ryu applications are well laid out, with many okuden (secret) mastry level techniques portrayed. The focus is primarily on sword to sword applications though there is also a small section on sword vs. yari (spear), naginata (halberd), bo (staff), and shuriken (throwing star) as well. There is also a bit of muto dori (no sword) techniques covered as well.  The author really knows his stuff and communicates it effectively. Tanaka sensei has been studying martial arts since 1956, achieving an 8th dan black belt in kobudo, 7th dan in jujutsu and kyoshi iai suemonogiri kenpo, 5th dan in Bojutsu, and 4th dan in kendo among other accomplishments. While you cannot learn any martial art solely from a book, this work is an excellent place to learn about these systems or augment your dojo training. Highly recommended!

A nice little reference+P+The compact size of this book makes it easy to keep handy, and it is full of useful information.  Some may (through personal experience) disagree with parts of it, but it will be invaluable to any new owner as it covers such an array of topics.  The easily readable style doesn't talk down to you, but is as if you have a friend talking to you.  I think it is excellent+books
Too basic+N+My impression was that this tape contained the most basic ideas that author's in this subject matter have ever presented. For eg., &quot;People crossing hands in front of their chest means that they aren't accepting what you are telling them.&quot; That is the most typical statement I have ever heard, and this tape is full of them. There is nothing enlightening, nothing that makes you glad that you bought and listened to the tape. I felt it was not good use of time or money.  Fo+books
Great Writer, Interesting Read+P+This was an extremely well-written and well-executed book from a technical standpoint.  The writing was smooth and concise, with excellent flow, and the story unfolds in a way that seems almost effortless.  Wolff adopts a remarkably objective tone in examining his own life, a tone which avoids making a melodrama out of his unfortunate childhood, while also creating a certain honesty that (eventually) makes you feel sympathy for a teenager who is not always easy to like.  A side-effect of this detached viewpoint, however, is that at first I felt somewhat removed from what was happening.  But I slowly warmed up to the young Wolff, and by the end I came to cheer for him.  I also recognized many of the feelings he had while growing up, feelings that are hard to admit to and even harder to put into words.  Wolff did a great job of exploring these feelings in an honest, tasteful way that was somehow both subtle and clear.  Overall I would recommend the book highly, and I plan on reading more from this author+books
great problem identifier, HORRID advice+N+This book is great for identifying problems that may be affecting you, it defines each problem very clearly, and there is a test in the beginning to help you figure out which problem areas are at the top of the list. It even gives examples of how these problem areas affect certain situations to clarify.   The problem with this book is the advice. A lot of it is very simple, and winds up contradicting itself. Some of it is not even helpful or good advice. Take for example the idea that one should ignore insults, in the chapter about Personalizing. It states that if you don't consistently ignore someone who is insulting you, it's called 'letting it get to you'. However, it's actually called 'letting someone walk all over you' and a better book would advise you to learn to be assertive and tell the person to stop, THE FIRST TIME, and if the person doesn't stop, to leave. Also, at the end of the chapter, is a real problem as well. He writes a scenario with a mother who made homemade salad dressing and her son doesn't like it. He then makes it sound as though it is okay for you to sit there and silently demean your own son in your head because of his personal tastes, saying stuff to yourself like he has an inability to appreciate good food, and that he is not the ultimate world judge of salad dressing worthiness (whilst true, this would imply the mother would think  that SHE is the ultimate world judge and is being quietly condescending), and that if she serves him bottled salad dressing next time and he complains, she can explain the error (in this case his personal tastes are considered WRONG) of his ways. This right here is an extremely poor model of appropriate thought behavior! Obviously the mother in the example is a bit of a narcissist and harmfully not allowing her son to have his own personal tastes without criticism. Things like this are why I refuse to give this book any review that makes it sound great.    So definitely take this book with a heaping pile of salt. Please don't let it be your self-help bible. There are other ways of acting that would be much much better than the advice given in this book. +books
Disappointed+N+I picked up this book after reading about it on the Simple Living network, which I found as an outgrowth of my interest in the work of the late Joe Dominguez and Vicki Robin and their work &quot;Your Money or Your Life&quot;.  Unlike Mr. Dominguez and Ms. Robin, who manage to lay out an actual plan for simple living, Ms. Andrews chooses to ramble and rail against consumerism.  After reading Dominguez, this book is disjointed, preachy and quite frankly, bad. That's not so say that Ms. Andrews doesn't have some good ideas.  She does, but as with so many anecdotal books, they're not the basis for changing your life in any significant way.  If you live an environmentally sensitive life, Ms. Andrews will certainly make you feel good about yourself, but if  your goal is to simplify your life, you could do better than spending time on this book+books
Not His Absolute Best Work...but good+P+This book is entertaining.  It is not as enthralling like other books Sheldon has written such as The Conspiracy Theory, The Stars Shine Down or Nothing Lasts Forever.  I found myself bored at times when reading this and then in a &quot;can't put it down&quot; mode at other times.  If you are a Sheldon fan, it is worth reading, but if you are new to this author try a different title first.  He is an exceptional story teller+books
One-Eyed Cat+P+One-Eyed Cat written by Paula Fox is a sweet book about a boy whose mom is in wheelchair and dad is minister at the church. Ned the boy receives a share of trouble throughout the book. I enjoyed this book because it is interesting within the book about Rivers, and animals. I disliked the book because it started out so slow in the beginning and rest of the book. I also disliked the book because the characters are dull and there isn't much rising action and major conflict so it is not as exciting as other books.  I also liked it because of it's setting of different places by the Hudson River.  This is a good book, I suggest reading it.  Good reading for all ages.

I Don't get....+N+why prior books that are far better researched have the lifespan of milk, while Goldberg who's story is surely contrived, gets five star reviews. Seems like working at The New Yorker and Washington Post trumps...  Danny Rubenstein's "The People of Nowhere" Amira Hass' "Drinking the Sea at Gaza" and Wendy Orange' "Coming Home to Jerusalem"   ...and many others who were deeply engaged journalists drop off the book list. Surely these now out of print books covered the same turf but none are connected to Goldberg's. WHY? Is it all about connections and pr? I think yes. What do you think?+books
Not a good investment+N+I was truly disappointed in this text.  While it may be appropriate for military use, I found it difficult to tranport the information and tactics to a civilian environment+books
I truly enjoyed it, but I have a couple concerns+P+Let me start by saying that I thoroughly enjoyed this work.  If you haven't read Michener before, this is a great place to start.  Typical of Michener, he tells the story of a region over the course of centuries in this book.  Michener has selected a particular river that feeds the Chesapeake, the Choptank, as his primary locale, but has populated it with geotypical persons, plantations, and towns, rather than any specific actual persons or towns from the Eastern Shore of the Chesapeake.  Having grown up in Maryland, I experienced a great deal of nostalgia for the areas he describes.  The characters he creates are believable and complex.  The stories he tells across the centuries are compelling.  I do have three concerns.  The first is minor -- in the green-covered paperback the word "scow" (a flat-bottomed boat) has been replaced with the word "snow" in every instance save one.  This makes for some odd reading, especially in the early chapters.  The second seems petty -- I actually believe there is not quite enough information in a nearly 1000-page novel.  He mentions guano trade, which significantly affected the Eastern Shore, only in one sentence at the end of the book.  He doesn't explain some of the early economies very clearly.  (With what was salt purchased from Tortuga?  There was no cash available, and credit with Fithian seems unlikely to have extended there.)  Islands other than the fictional Devon island (e.g. Tighlman Island) suddenly become important at the end of the book, and are referenced as "the old rivals of Patamoke."  If they are old rivals, why didn't they appear before?  Did this get cut out of the book?  My third concern is a very strange charge to levy against Michener.  As anyone who has seen the musical "South Pacific" knows, Michener is strongly opposed to racism.  Certainly in this book there are whites, blacks, and indians of the full range of character and talent.  However, the book still seems to have a strange racist undertone that I can't shake from my mind.  It comes from how Michener ties his story together across the centuries.  Every Janney is feckless (except for the one who becomes a Steed).  Every Steed is enterprising, although not necessarily industrious.  Every Turlock is craven.  Every Cater is proud, even if this is expressed differently across the generations.  Every Paxmore is upstanding, even the sad-sack Pusey Paxmore believes he is acting in an upstanding manor until he looks back on what he's done.  One Steed even refuses to acknowledge her own grandchildren because they have Turlock blood in them, and is praised by the author for doing so.  I realize that Michener was using a shorthand to help the reader keep characters straight across the centuries, but the result is rather too "geneticist," arguing that genes determine destiny+books
Bambi+P+I purchased this book for my 8 year old who needed it for a school project. The vocabulary used in this book is a bit difficult. I also found it to be quite different than the Disney movie and other written versions of the story. The author, Felix Salten, uses elaborate descriptions and you will feel as if you are actually in the woods with the deer! I recommend this book, but please be aware that it is not "sugar coated" like the movie+books
Slotkin's vision will change the way you think about America+P+Slotkin analyzes the popular texts of early American life--&quot;capitivity narratives&quot; of women abducted by Native Americans, dime novels, etc.--to show how early Americans came to  rationalize the gap between their religious ideology and the reality of the  wilderness they were meant to transform into the &quot;city on the  hill.&quot;  His careful study of the documents seems almost academic at  first, and is sometimes rough going, but when I let his argument sink in  (as a student in Slotkin's undergraduate class which used this book as its  text), it  profoundly and permanently transformed the way I saw American  culture and history.  This book is revelatory for anyone interested in  &quot;American Studies,&quot; the creation of our national mythology, and  in what makes America America+books
A struggle to finish+N+If this had been the first Crais book I'd read I wouldn't have read any others which would have been a pity as all his previous books (except the Forgotten Man) were excellent. The Two-Minute rule (note the use of the grammatically correct hyphen) has two main characters, Holman and Pollard, who are made of cardboard and are not in the least bit interesting. The plot was okay but the end was silly. I was bored throughout most of the book and couldn't wait for it to finish. If you want good Crais then read Demolition Angel, Hostage or LA Requiem and don't read this one.+books
Transcendental+P+This is the 3rd & culminating text of Jung's CW trilogy on alchemy (see CW11 Psychology & Alchemy & CW12 Alchemical Studies before reading this one).  Jung obviously devoted considerable time & effort into the study of alchemy--because he perceived an amazing parallel with his theories/model of the psyche & the process of individuation.  I think it amazed him that the alchemists intuitively evoked such general principles of transcendental alchemy prior to the development of western science--indeed, they were simultaneously immersed in this development such that modern chemistry evolved from it.  Oddly, some are now advocating the use of chemicals (drugs) in lieu of psychology--e.g. for schizophrenia.  Maybe the tail is wagging the horse?  Of course, this is a difficult text.  The alchemical series may be the most difficult of Jung's already difficult texts.  But, as Jung demonstrated himself, sometimes the way to learn is to just jump in feet first--absorb as you can.  Eventually, the material will start to sink in--subconsciously if not consciously.  Give it a whirl.  This text also has some VERY interesting quotes:  p. 82 "There is something serious in every joke.  p. 125 If one does not understand a person, one tends to regard him as a fool.  p. 200 It seems as if Christianity had been from the outset the religion of chronic squabbles, and even now it does everything in its power never to let the squabbles rest.  Remarkably enough, it never stops preaching the gospel of neighborly love.  p. 376 The creative mystic was ever a cross for the Church, but it is to him that we own what is best in humanity...'where there is no vision, the people perish...The mystics are channels through which a little knowledge of reality filters down into our human universe of ignorance and illusion: A totally unmystical world would be a world totally blind and insane...the few theocentric saints who exist at any given moment are able in some slight measure to qualify and mitigate the poisons which society generates within itself by its political and economic activities.  In the gospel phrase, theocentric saints are the salt which preserves the world from decay.' (quoting Aldous Huxley in Grey Eminence 1943, pp. 98, *296.  p. 487 Fantasies always mean something when they are spontaneous.  p. 519 Never do human beings speculate more, or have more opinions, than about things which they do not understand.  p. 536 Nothing changes anything else without itself being changed."

A World of Wisdom in One Book!+P+As an author, Maeve Binchy makes me want to throw in the towel every time I have the privilege of reading one of her books.  She is the Dickens of our day.  No one can bring characters to life, and use a turn of a phrase like her.  She is so pointed in her depth of understanding humanity, it's incredible.  I am so glad she chooses to share the gift with her readers rather than just run off with the cash she's already made.  : )  This book is one of her best, with the setting of Rossmore being its own true character and all the supporting characters making it a place so real, I want to book a trip now!  Bravo to the Master!!+books
Uncle Tom's Cabin - Review by Trish New+N+A catalyst for the civil war, Uncle Tom's Cabin gives vivid details on the living conditions of the black slaves. The book's literary worth lies in the fact that people can make a difference by speaking out, and by preserving a kind of fictional history of the African American's pain, despite being redundant, rube and rife with tautology. The story is about Tom, a slave who saves his master's daughter and is promised his freedom. But his master dies before Tom is actually freed. The family falls upon hard times and Tom is sold to a horrible slave owner named Simon Legree. Legree tried everything to degrade Tom, but Tom holds firmly to his religious convictions.+books

D.C. confidential.+P+Readers familiar with Ross Thomas' work are likely to recognize a few of the characters in Twilight at Mac's Place from some of the author's other novels.  Most notably, Mac McCorkle and Mike Padillo, the restaurant owning duo with more than a passing knowledge of the dark arts associated with international espionage. Twilight at Mac's Place transpires in and around Washington, DC during the month of January, 1989.  George H.W. Bush has just been sworn in as President. The third person narrator helpfully reminds us that Mr. Bush is the first President to have previously served as Director of Central Intelligence.  That interesting bit of information helps to set the mood for the tale of cloak and dagger intrigue that is about to unfold.  A man named Steady Haynes dies suddenly of natural causes the evening before the inauguration.  Though never officially an agent of the CIA, Haynes has spent most of his career unofficially facilitating the carrying out of some very nasty things on the Agency's behalf all over the world.  When Granville Haynes, Steady's son and a former LAPD homicide detective, comes to Washington to attend his father's funeral, he learns that Steady had let it be known that he had recently written his memoirs.  It soon becomes very apparent that there are people out there who do not want Steady's manuscript to ever see the light of day.  And they are not above commiting murder to see that it doesn't.  The complex plot of Twilight at Mac's Place revolves around the younger Mr. Haynes, with the help of McCorkle and Padillo, uncovering who the anonymous literary suppressors are.  This very appealing book contains plenty of the byzantine twists and turns Thomas is famous for.  Moreover, there are plenty of interesting characters and the dialogue is unfailingly smart and entertainingly clever.  Recommended to those readers who like their political mysteries laced with sophisticated humor and an insider's view of the way Washington does business.+books

One of Walters' Best+P+THE SCOLD'S BRIDLE, in my opinion, is one of Minette Walters' best mysteries--at least one of her best I've read so far!  Her characters are well-developed, and the reader doesn't know from one page to the next who the murderer could be--NO ONE liked Mathilda, it seemed.  Throughout the police investigation, readers are faced with learning of Mathilda Gillispie's abusive and haunting background of secrets, lies, and deception.  Mathilda's character, though dead as the story begins, is developed more fully through her diary entries interspersed between chapters.  Having left all of her money to an unlikely person, her doctor Susan Blakeney, Mathilda's daughter and granddaughter are brought into the story assuming they would inherit Mathilda's wealth.  Readers find that Mathilda's daughter and granddaughter have experienced much of the intense emotional and physical abuse as Mathilda had.  This part of the story, no doubt, leaves readers pondering how abuse often perpetuates itself through generations.  Walters doesn't let on who the murderer is, and I'll admit, I was a little disappointed in its resolution given that the novel seemed more focused in a different direction.  Overall, I enjoyed this novel moreso than THE ICE HOUSE or THE SCULPTRESS, but they are all very good books, and I would wholeheartedly recommend Walters to readers wanting a good mystery+books
Wonderful+P+Ronald L.Davis' study of the beautiful 'Fox Girl', Linda Darnell is one written with great kindness and respect to this most wonderful lady. This book does not delve into the trash and gossip that often is cruelly and  unnecessarily found in film star biographies. Davis looks at Linda with a  caring pen and writes about her fairly. Although he writes about her  personal troubles he does so gently with heart and understanding. He spent  many hours interviewing her daughter Charlotte, her sisters Undeen and  Monte, her brother Cal and numerous friends. This helps to give the book a  personal feel that is not found in those written from archives and second  hand news. I adored Linda before reading this book and when I finished he  cemented my adoration of the Lady forever+books

Leaves me cold+N+This rates as one of the poorer mysteries I have read in years.  It was truly an ordeal to finish, and I am left wondering why I bothered.  It has a totally unbelievable plot and inconsistent characters, many of whom are  stereotypical creations of little or no interest.  I was particularly  amused when the detective was told to &quot;make a few inquiries at the  transsexual shoe shop, giving the size and style of the shoe from the  corpse&quot;.  In all of LA, I am sure there is just one known  &quot;transsexual shoe shop&quot;.  Please.  I suspect Ms. LaPlante has  better material, but this is a poor example better left unread.  I would  give it less than one star, but unfortunately that's not an option+books
Great first hand account of aerial combat during the Fall of France+P+Fighter Pilot lays claim to being the first published account of aerial combat during the Second World War. Originally published anonymously during the war, the author literally flew missions during the day while meeting with the editor in pubs at night to finish the book.  Richey's book reads like a daily journal of his adventures after deploying to France in 1939 to wait out the "Phony War." Once Germany blitzed France and the Low Countries though, things became very busy very quickly. Richey, like his compatriots, fought bravely, but they were greatly outnumbered. As France's defenses collapsed, there was very little they could do.  One of the most interesting aspects is how his view of the war changes from before the shooting war through just a few weeks of real fighting. Their original notion of their work is very chivalrous and idealistic, with lots of references to "our turn" to repeat the noble efforts of the aces from World War I. After downing their first German, they gather war trophies from the plane, take pictures, and invited a captured German pilot over for beer and celebration.  A few weeks later, as the British Expeditionary Force continues to retreat, France collapses, and many of their squadron mates in the earlier photos have been killed, there is little chivalry and idealism left. They settle into the grim business of fighting for their life, realizing that the Battle of France is lost and growing fear for what will happen to Britain.  Even in comparing it to World War One accounts (McCudden, Lewis, or Biddle), initially there is a lot of similarity in the events and encounters. Then, it quickly spirals into a brutal onslaught.  The book is easy to read and flows very well. Most readers are probably surprised to learn the book finishes before the Battle of Britain begins. Fortunately, there is a sequel, Fighter Pilot's Summer, that Richey started during the war, but which wasn't completed until after his death in the 1990's.  Any aviation and World War II history buff will be extremely happy with the book and primary source material. This is particularly true given the wealth of information on the Battle of Britain, but the dearth of writing on the air war over France that was the prelude. This book fills an important gap in first hand accounts of aerial combat during the Battle for France.+books

Entry level modeling on Max+P+I found this book to be very well written and easy to understand, for the most part the book will take you by the hand in modeling a character (using 3Ds Max 3). If you are a total newbie you will find this book easy to comprehend and follow wish in my opinion will set some foundation for you if you wish to buy and read more advanced books on the subject. On the downsize the book does a little attempt to explain texturing a character and doesn't go in deep in the process of designing the textures of the characters. But all in all a pretty nice book for entry level character design+books
Fabulous Book+P+What a wonderful book.  Quite often, a book is real good until the ending, and then I'm let down,  But this has a really good ending too.  This tale is really excellent:  a verbal piece of art.  I liked all the lineage and interconnections in this large musical family.  I learned what it's like to have mucic within you -- to write as well as perform.  I liked the character developments -- no one all good or all bad, but all very interesting.  I recommend this book highly.  One learns about US history, country music, human nature, and it's entertaining to boot+books
Loved it+P+Thought is was a great book with much variety. Wished for more pictures though.  I like the pictures too+books
Violent - what were they thinking?  Good concept, poor choices.+N+I purchased this book to give as a gift to my nephew.  When it arrived, I opened the book to the middle and I could not believe what I was looking at.  One of the art scenes is of a battle where a man charging on a horse has been decapitated.  Blood is spewing from the headless neck, his necklace is falling in one direction, and his separated head (with a horror/surprise look on his face) is falling to the ground behind the horse.  This is very gruesome, and there is no way I could give this as a gift a child of any age.  Wondering what could be worse, I turned the page to find another battle scene.  One man is being struck to the back of the head with a club/mace and his head is caved by the blow.  I am not making this up, the head is split open and details are painted.  Many others in this same art work lie dead and dieing with arrows in their heads and torsos.  I look at the next artwork, and a man is pinning another to the ground while he slices his throat with a knife.  Why would someone pick these art works?  Why would the editors allow them?  I'm still stunned that this would make it print.+books
Enlightening description of immigration and languages+P+I started reading this wonderful book 6 months before I left Brazil towards Israel. After finishing the first Part (Paradise) I just could not keep on reading, and I abandoned the book for a while. After I landed in Israel I re-took the book and was delighted again with the realness of it. A thought occurred to me that the reading was so descriptive of the immigration sentiment that I just could not understand it before immigrating myself.  The book helped me to understand and to organize the infinite sensations that come with the leaving/arriving to another country. How the language affects the way we think and act, how sadness and happiness are mingled into one strange feeling, how we cope and forget without noticing, and how we urge to succeed and prove that we can be part of the new country.  In addition, the book also brought to me new feelings and curiosities about my grandparents, whom also escaped from Poland and Russia in the late 40's. Hoffman describes so well how the old traditions and languages influenced the new live of those who left their country because of prejudice and persecution!  One passage that I am specially fond of: "No, I'm no patriot, nor was I ever allowed to be. And yet, the country of my childhood lives within me with a primacy that is a form of love. (...) All it has given me is the world, but that is enough. It has fed me language, perceptions, sounds, the human kind. It has given me the colors and the furrows of reality, my first loves. The absoluteness of those loves can never be recaptured: no geometry of the landscape, no haze in the air, will live in us as intensely as the landscapes that we saw as the first, and to which we gave ourselves wholly, without reservations." It reminds me of Wordsworth when he writes about Tintern Abbey.  A wonderful life-changing book.+books
Great book for it's honesty and and intellectual acumen+P+Having read this book in 1992 and recently purchased it for my collection, this a great read with various chapters based on history, politcal,and social mores of African- Americans  (in the black corner)and our archenemies White Americans (in the white corner). got to hype up the race war angle some of you white conservatives  who are doing it in your reviews about this book. If you have a politcal agenda you will either like or hate Hacker's book based on your politcal afilliation, If you are a Liberal, you may like the senstive and fair airing he gives towards the history of why we became two nations.If you are a conservative or Neo- Nazi type like the white racist from georgia that African- Americans have no morals,or you will hate that he's giving Black folks a pass on their moral problems.  Well as a Black Nationalist who  believes that intergration is bad social policy but a  majority Black commonwealth on American soil may be benefical, I think that historical factors presented in Hacker's book would  prevent both sides from ever seeing each other in any rational sense as Americans because  1. Whites see each other as  intellectually, morally superior to African - Americans (even the lowest white trash person) and will never consider them equal in the eyes of U.S. law or in their hearts  2. African - Americans (especailly males) will never forgive or forget what  the majority White population did to their families, culture, livelihoods and community structures especailly after Slavery.  Hacker has crafted an excellent book through great research and in many ways he is on point  throughout the book,  when he states  the the majority white population will make Hispanics and Asians "honoray whites" demonizing Black Males for politcal and social advantage against charges of racism by blacks. And many of your reviewers are right about some blacks hating whites, I think 387 years of continual defacto racism would create some blacks who would  hurt their fellow blacks (in a self- destructive way)  whites and other citizens (some blacks hate whites like the Arabs hate Jews).I consider that like the scene in the movie "Independence Day", when "President" Bill Pullman asked the Alien,   Pullman -  can there be peace between our worlds  Alien - NOOOOOOOOO NO PEACE !!!!  Pullman - What do you want from us?  Alien  I want you to DIE !!!!!  Let the hate mail begin !!!! at least I was "candid" in our so- called dicussion on race+books
Lighten up, folks!+N+The author has provided the context in which he wrote this book.  As an adolescent boy in the 1970s, I found it an interesting read.  Since I had the good sense to not attempt any of the hare-brained schemes in the book, I am still healthy and have all of my limbs.  If people are interested in improvised munitions and the like, there are at least six (6) US Army FMs and TMs on the subject that I am aware of.  Bear in mind that the making of explosive devices is a serious felony, and should not be attempted without the proper Federal and State licenses and permits.  BATFE does not take kindly to the making of unregistered and untaxed explosives+books
A book for all serious traders+P+Market wizards defines the wiinning behaviour and trading approaches needed by serious traders.  Although the trading styles may be different, there is similarity between the psychological behaviour of all the winning traders Jack Schwager interviews.  Its the responses of the winning traders and their advice that is priceless+books
Outright Dangerous+N+Before you even CONSIDER buying this book, take a few seconds to try this instructive little exercise: type "feed onions cats" (without the quotation marks) into your browser's search field, and see what comes up.  ONIONS ARE TOXIC TO CATS.  Cats are obligate carnivores, and many common plant compounds that humans ingest daily are actually poisonous to them.  I wish that there were some way to get this book out of Amazon.com's database.  Many thanks to Cat Rescuer (see below) for being the first to spot this unbelievable incompetence and warn unsuspecting cat owners away from this "cookbook".  This review is largely a repetition of what Cat Rescuer has already said; I just added this one on to knock a star of the book's rating.  Please feel free to do the same+books
John Ayres is no Delphi expert and certainly no writer+N+You'd think the qualifications for writing a Delphi book would be 1) you must be a Delphi expert 2) you must write well.  Well, I can tell you for sure that this guy doesn't meet either qualification.  This is, without question, the worst programming book I have ever had the misfortune to buy.  Ayres writes like a third grader.  And the code is even worse.  A person who'd never seen Delphi before could write this code.  It is mostly warmed over MSDN example code converted to Pascal.  Frankly, I'd be embarrassed to publish something like this.  It's that bad+books
Poetry for the Mind+P+This book manages to capture the whole Broadway show and then some in 209 pages. I find the poetry in this book phenomenal and very truthful.

My College Bible+P+An absolute wonder, a perfect selection of Beat writings: Poems, fragments of novels, essays, history, mythology, philosophy...  The Portable Beat Reader is one of the most essential books in my collection and rarely leaves my side.  And it is, thankfully, portable, and much easier than bringing everything with you all the time.  Aquire it, open it, and just start reading+books
Not for the solo lawyer; not about marketing, except for the author+N+I was disappointed by this book.  I am a solo litigation attorney, and I read the book to get ideas on marketing.  It gave me some ideas.  Perhaps the most valuable idea was to focus more on customer service; Dahut has an interesting discussion about exactly what that means and how we can do it better.  By and large, however, this is a book by and for big firm attorneys.  It is about big firm angst and how it can be combated by hiring experts such as Dahut to do extensive consulting work for your firm.  Dahut does not acknowledge, and does not care, that most attorneys are solos or work in small firms, and that we have very different issues than agonizing over whether we have lost our soul by conforming to much to dead firm culture+books
Read Conventional Wisdom+P+This book changed me from a Stravinsky-like &quot;music has no meaning&quot; stance. I still don't think that music is sad or happy or like a day in the country, things are more complicated than that, but I no longer feel that music is an empty if beautiful vessel. Instead music, like all actions (and non-actions), is political. I only give it a four because I would recommend her next book far more+books
A Constant Chore+N+I'd been hearing about the wonderful writing of John Le Carre for quite some time, so I picked up The Constant Gardener for a fun read . . . and it was anything but.  And while I don't know if this is typical of the LeCarre spy novels, I certainly hope not.  The plot is basically a single man versus international conspiracy.  It's a plot that would normally catch my attention early and have my sympathy from the start. Further, it's a commentary on the abuses of power wrought by corporations (in this case, Pharmaceutical) that are more powerful than governments.  Again, a device that immediately evokes common interests with me, an unabashed liberal.  Unfortunately that's where the book and I part ways.  Justin, the minor diplomat in Nairobi is thrown into an unfortunate series of discoveries when questioning the circumstances of his wife's rape and murder.  Tessa differed from Justin in that she was engaged in pursuing change in the world as a human rights activist, while he was content to follow orders, but say and believe the right things sans effort.  This, I believe is the theme of the work, that culpability lies mostly with inaction and that movements can overcome abuses of power.  Good theme, but . . .  The execution was poor.  Pages and pages devoted to characterization fell short when actions didn't meet the set-up.  As well, Justin's investigation took him around the world to look at a paper trail, not the most interesting tools of the thriller game.  But we, as well as the character, examined the words and trail meticulously to the point where it became a joke how quickly the volume would put me to sleep.  Justin is such a luddite that we, as the reader, are forced to learn about computers, emails, and the myriad electronic communication pathways along with the protagonist . . . LeCarre would have been well-suited to find a heartless editor, because the plot that does exist is not much more substantial than what a novella would handle nicely.  Bureaucracy can be handled in a paragraph where the author wants the reader as frustrated as his bureaucrat protagonist, an interesting irony done uninterestingly.  This isn't to say that LeCarre is a poor writer - his sentence construction is strong and his mastery of the craft evident.  I'm going to try another of his novels just because I believe this was an aberration caused by an author with an axe to grind and no right way to do it.  Another problem was that he telegraphed the plot.  The only one stupid enough not to see who was behind the murder and conspiracy was Justin himself.  While this can work, showing the reader what the protagonist can't see (see Fight Club), in this case it's just painful to have to slough through the machinations of bumbling intrigue with a dull and plodding man.   In summary, I didn't care about characters and I lost interest in the plot and the theme seemed contrived.  I can't recommend it.  - CV Ric+books
love of nature grows the more we know+P+I am delighted with this encyclopedia which I ordered as a present for my six year old.  This handsome book has beautiful pictures and lots of information covering many aspects of nature.  Attractive and accessible, it provides great rewards for the young reader whose love and respect of nature will grow as their knowledge expands.   I expect it to be used in greater depth as my daughter grows older.  For now, she loves to open it up and see what she finds  -  and becomes engaged immediately.  I highly recommend it+books
codes nothing but a fluke!+P+just finished reading this book.  what can i say?  this book seems to finally put the controversy to rest. PHEW! what a relief,i thought i may  actually have to start believing in god or something.    this book is full  of data and statistical analyses. it isn`t much like all the other bible  code books out there, and i`ve read most of them.  my favorite is cracking  the bible code by j. satinover.    this book(dr. ingermanson) is more  scientific and gets down to the dirty work of disproving the codes  scientifically.  he calls himself a computer geek in his bio. and after  reading his book i`d have to agree with him.  he has a strange sense of  humour as well, almost appeasing.     great book and puts the debate to  rest once and for all+books
Hippy commune cooking+N+When I bought this book I thought I was getting a simple living book about how to cook beans. I guess I should have read more about it in amazon, but it reminds me of 1960s hippy commune vegetarian cooking. Not what I had in mind. A lot of soy, tofu, honey and all that. I wish someone would write a book about plain cooking that uses beans and meat+books

Huh?+N+I read the first chapter and I was puzzled. Then I went back, read it again, and laughed. My tenth grade creative writing class can make a better effort at a plot, dialogue, and characterization than that, and be witty to boot. As for the quality of the writing, just the dialogue in the Quick Stop scene was enough to make my head spin around and explode. After reading this, I wasn't sure whether the author was high, or if he just hadn't seen a lot of Buffy and decided to make up the show and the characters' personalities (into something so juvenile and whacked out, it was almost incomprehensible). Did they let a 13-year-old fanboy write this? No, that can't be, because there is fanfiction out there that is many, many levels above this. ... Don't waste your money on this atrocious mess+books
A great read+P+In November of 1985 when I was seven years old my fatherwas watching a mini series (remember those people) on CBS. It was Kane and Abel and after watching it for the last 22 years I have been fasinatied with that story. I did not know until 2006 that it was a book so I bought it and its sequel. I loved the Prodigal daughter although I do have some things I would have done differently. I for one who have call the book the Prodigal children with a  focus on Richard childhood as well. One of my favorite things in the novel was that while FLorentyna was a Democrat Richard was a Repulican (The good kind not the crazy ones you have today.) I guess becuase although there is around a 10-15 year age difference between the chacters and my own parents that is how they are. (My favorite scene in this is when RIchard puts a Barry Goldwater bumpersticker on their car she rips it right off. ANother one  is when RIchard after telling his wife that he did not cheat on her FLorentyna said "You should have slept with her" meaning RIchard's old girlfriend becuase that would have cemeted a business deal ) I also did not like fact that RIchard died and they brought in Edward WIncheaster as a second husband or that the book went into a future that never could come true. BUt then again that is nit picking. By the way a book in which a blond 60 something CHicago born woman seantor becomes the first female United States President. HIllary some British guy made you Polish+books
Very disappointing.+N+I found it to lean very heavily towards a hierarchal view of the relationship between men and women.  Men are to rule, and women are to submit to that rule.  The authors appear to see women as perpetual children who need to be under the continual domination of men, rather than as adults who deal with men on an adult level.  I suggest anyone who reads this books should also read "Discovering Biblical Equality."  It gives another view of how the Christians world see the role of women+books
All time favorite historical novel!+P+Wonderful book - recommend Sarum if you liked this one+books
History Comes to Life!+P+The Bible is the deepest, most intelligent, and powerful writing ever penned. Because it is such a profound book, parts of it may at times seem confusing. Many times I struggled through the pages of the Old Testament trying to comprehend the history. Sometimes I would give up, becoming weary of the long string of names or descriptions of who begat whom.   Why did God's Word have to be so difficult for me? I so wanted to be able to read the Bible and be as interested in its history as I was in the Tudor Era. Of course, I never dreamed that there was a book out there just for me.  When my Mom presented me with Adam and His Kin by Dr. Ruth Beechick I immediately devoured it. The story, the history, the Bible! Mrs. Beechick retells the story of Genesis like no other author has. I found myself intrigued and delighted as I read about Eve's heartbreaking struggle in the Garden of Eden, the tragic murder of Abel, the fascinating story of Noah, and even the tower of Babel.  It was like reliving history beside these amazing figures and the spectacular events which surrounded them. I could actually feel Eve's longing for the forbidden, I mourned for Noah as he was made fun of and taunted while he built the most amazing boat in the world, the boat that God instructed him to build.  In Adam and His Kin history comes to life and you experience what life was like thousands of years ago. In my opinion, this book is a masterpiece and I can give it nothing but the highest praise.

Overblown and Messy+N+While Julia Barrett touches on the language "spoken" in Jane Austen's novels, it's not expressed with any feeling or wit.  The words seem to be a jumble of Austenique words placed to look good, but not sound good.  After chapter 11 the book goes into a million different directions, is narrated from several characters points of view, leaves almost no room for the main characters (Charlotte Heywood) views to be expressed, her feelings to be voiced and is just plain messy.  In most of Austen's novels, you have an opportunity to see the relationship grow between the main charactor and her "intended".  In Charlotte, you wonder how they fell in love at all.  They rarely see one another, they rarely speak and when they do, it's mostly short and nonsensible.    Then there is the plot line, or rather shall I say lines for there are several (thank you Mr. Collins).  There is the plot to save Sandition by gaining a physician, by adding a Crescent, allowing racing gentleman and their horses (and then the sub-plot to this to keep them out)and then the smuggling and bootlegging.  Dear me!  How did anything get done?  I confess, I got bored and just scanned the rest of the book!  Honestly, I was disgusted.    If you love Austen's last novel and would like to see how she may have ended it, let me recommend a book far superior to Charlotte.  Instead try Sandition.    Sandition does tend to get a little flowery in some places.  Charlotte Heywood does tend to get a little flustered and unable to speak her mind around Sidney Parker.  However on the whole, it's a much more convincing end to Austen's last attempt.  The characters actually grow.  They learn.  Here is an example.  In Charlotte: Arthur Parker is an "invalid" who learns that perhaps he is not so invalid and then spends the rest of the book remarking to his intended, also thinking herself an invalid, about how herorically he withstands his difficulties with stomach ailments.  To which she agrees and says that they only can know how much each endurs to live with this horrid desease.  And then they proceed to expound on how proud they are over their problems and attempt to live with them.  (sigh).  In Sandition:  Arthur Parker is an "invalid" who realizes that perhaps, not only is he NOT an invalid but that there are people fairing far worse then him and do not complain.  He falls for a young woman who truly is fragile but makes no complaints, only attempts to live each good day she has to the fullest.  He learns from her what it is to be healthy.  They both grow and support each other in a common goal that gets them out of a smoke filled tea room and into the fresh sea breezes.  He collects and she draws what he collects.  He learns to protect her (instead of whining over his bouts and supposed illnesses) and she learns to be stronger.    Sandition is also a book in which you can actually SEE Charlotte and Sidney fall in love.  You can watch her struggle over "does he or does he not".  It's a much more delightful alternative to all the "our herione" and "our hero" and "my herione" and "my hero"'s that go on in Charlotte (if I read one more of those I thought I would choke).    So, to sum up?  Don't Don't Don't waste your time, money or energy on Charlotte, but DO get Sandition.  It's a welcome addition to Jane Austen's library+books
Disappointing - Nothing new, nothing original+N+This is an example of one of those thousands of guitar books which discusses several subjects in a superficial way and never really nails anything down in a useful way. The author has not put forth a single original idea or even bothered to present the same old stuff in a new and different way. This book is not a guide to the fretboard, it is basic music theory for absolute beginners. If you want rock solid information about the guitar's fretboard skip this and do what everyone else does:  get Fretboard Logic. The author has released several books under the same title with pretty much the same stuff in each one. This one is a Mel Bay retread+books
Love this book!+P+It has so many recipes to choose from.  This book is great. I recommend it to all of my clients+books
A poor read and flawed history+N+This book is somewhat entertaining, but it could've used an editor.  Unfotunately, it not only lacks a great deal of facts, but it often gives the opposite.  The author frequently falls into tired, false cliche about his opinions of the era, which often contradicts his more factual claims, and speaks about it's figures as if he had known then inside and out, and disliked them.  The ridiculous Mark Twain-esque cliches he claims as facts are enough to drop the book, making it just another in the 100 year long pile of falsified, biased histories of the middle ages+books
Speaking of whining...+P+To: Rat After spending my entire adult life as a working single mother, I find your whining about mothers as "the most priveleged class" uninformed, if not downright ludicrous.  You feel you have to do all of their work for them while they lazily sit around the house?  I have never personally spent "years on leave".  Although, I have covered countless shifts for my hungover or broken-hearted, childless co-workers, and have only stayed home with a sick child about 5 times in 13 years.  I have taken on more [...], covered more [...] and put up with more bull than I deserved, because as the sole support of my child, I couldn't risk losing my job.  I have been an employer's bargain!  Furthermore, Rat -- you clearly do not understand the concept of flex time.  Flex time doesn't mean somebody works less hours than you.  Flex time means there is an inherent flexibility built into EVERYONE'S work schedule, so that work gets done, but life can happen to.  You are probably familiar with this concept in reality -- have you ever skipped lunch so you could leave early to go to the dentist?  In the future, please try to wrap your brain around the bigger picture before you jump to such conclusions+books
Where is all the information?+N+This is a skeleton of a Bible names dictionary.

If you're struggling with behavior issues, read this book.+P+Exasperation with our son's behavior led to the purchase of this book. He's now 3 1/2. He is high energy in most everything he does. He's more energetic, more intense, more inquisitive, more dramatic. The older he gets, the "more" he has become.  This book helped us understand that there are many other kids just like ours, that "more" is not bad (like his PreK teacher had us thinking) and that parenting a spirited child requires a different set of skills.  The author doesn't give any one sure-fire way to help with the daily struggles you face with a spirited child, but she does direct you and help you to understand. Without this book, we may have never understood what spirit is in a child+books
Valerie Hector's book is attributed to wrong author+P+After waiting over a year to see this book, it is very strange to see Amazon.com make Lois Dubin the author of this book. Dubin wrote a forward to the book. Dubin is not the author of this book.  The author is Valerie Hector.  The book is simply wonderful+books
Magic Christian lacks any real magic+N+While Guy Grand's pranks are amusing, the book lacks any real satirical center or dramatic structure, which would give it some meaning (and some real bite).  You could take the chapters out of their present sequence, reassemble them in any order, and the book would be just as effective --- and that's about as damning a criticism as I can think of.  The book utlimately is a washout.  It starts and stops in the same place, and in between the narrative just meanders from episode to episode without any real idea of what it wants to do, or how to do it.  Not Southern's best, by any means, but better than tripe like CANDY+books
Detailed transformations of algorithms for optimal desighns+P+This is an excellent book, written by one of the authorities in the field. It offers detailed design techniques that will help the system designer explore the 3-dimension design space and achieve optimizations in all or  either of: area, time, energy consumption. The use of specific examples  illustrates the techniques, while complicated backround information is  well-organized in the Appendices. I used the book as a recommended text  book in my 1-semester "VLSI Signal Processing" graduate-level class and the  students really loved it. It covers all availble techniques, from the  simplest to the most advanced ones, with full explanation of the theory,  with complete and detailed implementation steps for a wide range of signal  processing algorithms.Since the book does not deal with the design at the  physical level, but with transformations of the processing algorithms so  that their VLSI implementations will satisfy certain criteria of  optimality, it is not absolutely mandatory that the reader has already  taken courses in VLSI design, although this could help appreciate the  benefits offered by the techniques detailed in the book. The exercises  found at the end of each chapter help the reader apply the learned  techniques in all kinds of applications. I am convinced that the  thoroughness and the high standards accomplished by the author in the  writing of this book will help establish it as the leading text or  reference book for several years to come+books
Put Me in the Zoo+P+Robert Lopshire made the best children's book that I have ever read and made me want to read more when I was smaller.

When I was smaller I would never let go of this funny, excellent, and very unique book+books

Familiarity breeds comfort in the classics+P+Rosemary Sutcliff excels at story telling by making the epic story of the Iliad understandable and thrilling to a seven year old.  I have read this book to my son at least three times, beginning when he was seven years old.  He is now so familiar with the story and characters of the Iliad as a result of Black Ships Before Troy that to read Homer's Iliad will simply mean meeting these familiar characters again.  Sutcliff's writing is so engaging that parents as well will enjoy this book.  An absolute bonus is the excellent illustrations by Alan Lee+books
Based on the wrong premise+N+The authors of this book seem to believe that the best individual performers should become managers - that is not something that I can agree with. It is full of pompous language (I do not want to see the word empowerment again in my whole life) instead of real-world advice. I simultaneously bought the book First-Time Manager and it is much better+books
Revolutionary+P+I used to hate lap swimming but now I love it, and it's because of this book. Laughlin has reinvented swim instruction. He's made it fun. He's made it easy. And the resulting stroke is heaven.  The exercises do take some effort and dilligence to master. But if you go slow don't move on until you have mastered each exercise, as instructed, you'll open up a whole new world of swimming enjoyment. I often feel like I'm flying in the water. This former water buffalo now swims like a fish.   Note: there's a brand new Total Immersion book being touted on the TI website, which I haven't read. You may want to look into that, instead. Also, some reviews and TI suggest the DVD as the best method, but that wasn't the case for me. In my case, it was the clear, detailed instructions in the book that made it happen.+books
THIS BOOK IS HORRIBLE+N+Okay, now, for all of you who are expecting a book that teaches interesting morals and cool things in it, put this book away right now!!!

I've give it no stars if I could+N+Certainly it is not to my dismay that this will be the author's last edition.    Her information is all right in many ways, but useless in most.  If you want drug store quality cosmetics, you can find useful ones, some very good ones.  If you want very good quality cosmetics, more often you will pay for the increased quality.   Ms. Begoun says in the intro to this (hopefully) final edition, that she was hired by a mall in Silver Spring years ago.  Since I grew up in the Silver Spring area and still live nearby, I'd love to know what mall she's referring to.  Years ago there were no malls in Silver Spring.  A few shopping centers, but no malls.    She says she had acne and saw that toners didn't close pores, etc.  She's right in many ways, but she's way off in so many other ways her book is a mish-mash of misinformation mixed in with some basic common sense that anyone can figure out on her own.  If you want the very best cosmetics, you will have to patronize high-end stores like Nordstrom, Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, etc.  The professionals there will help you find what is best for your skin.  It may take time, but all depends on what you want.   Ms. Begoun criticizes some very fine lines of cosmetics.  Maybe they don't work for her.  When I look through her book, it may be cleverly written, but she doesn't really know what she's talking about.  I had "bad skin" until I began using the Erno Laszlo line.  I had clogged pores, pimples, dry, scaly patches.  After a few months of using Laszlo and continuing to now, people I don't even know comment on how clear and pretty my complexion is.  Strangers don't comment on someone's skin for nothing.  When I see Ms. Begoun's book, I always turn to the section where she rips the Erno Laszlo line of cosmetics.  This edition, she omits what she has written in the past, that Laszlo customers are extremely loyal and swear by the product. There is a reason Laszlo customers are loyal.  It works better than any other line out there if you want your skin to look excellent throughout your life.   I have used Erno Laszlo for almost 32 years and no one ever believes that I am 53 years old.  Of course I don't look 20!  But my skin is smooth, the occasional dark "age spot" that appears fades within a few weeks of using Laszlo's wonderful "No. 3-9".  My husband is 47, looks younger than 47, and still everyone thinks he is older than me.  My lipline is smooth, lipstick has no vertical lines to bleed into when I wear lipstick, which is daily.    Ms. Begoun in this edition of the book says that Erno Laszlo could not have known about exfoliation or the dangers of rinsing with hot, hot water (part of his system requires 30 rinses of hot water twice a day), but that rinsing does exfoliate and I have no tiny spider veins on my face that she claims hot water can cause.  My cheeks are smooth and while gravity is taking its toll (Laszlo works, but gravity is a very powerful force and I don't expect to look 40 when I'm 70!)  She rips other up-scale cosmetic lines but I think that's because she has a conflict of interest.  Is she selling her own products?  I know previous editions promoted her own line of cosmetics, I didn't bother to find out if she's still doing so.    Erno Laszlo had as his clients years ago movie stars such as Marilyn Monroe, Gloria Swanson, Greta Garbo and Joan Crawford - you can read in "Mommy Dearest" how Crawford's daughter thought her mother was obsessive in the way she rinsed her face repeatedly each morning and evening!  The reason Erno Laszlo had these clients is because his system works.  It's not cheap, it's very expensive, but it works.  Most definitely, it works.  Last week, I was "carded"!  Quite a compliment for a someone who's been a mom for over 32 years+books
Very bad book - don't buy+N+If I purchased this book in 1995 when Delphi came up I would be really satisfied. But when you have around &quot;Developers guide&quot; and &quot;Mastering&quot; books along with the list of other usefull ones, I consider that buying this book is just waste of your money+books
Excellent antidote to revisionist history!+P+This is a marvelous guide book.  We intended to visit Plymouth on our vacation this year but did not make it.  However, we plan to take this book with us when we go next year.  Dr. Jehle goes through all the signifcant sites at Plymouth and takes you through the history (the real history, not the revisionist, politically correct nonesense that passes for history today) of that site/monument in detail.  He acknowledges the contributions of both the Pilgrims and the native peoples and highlights the strong faith of our founders as well as that of many of those in the native population.  I highly recommend this, especially if you want to teach your children the history of our founding+books
Excellent Expository Text+P+In _The Lacanian Subject: Between Language and Jouissance_, Bruce Fink delivers a clear and comprehensive account of the notion of the subject as it operates in Lacanian theory and clinical practice. The book's focus, of course, is much broader than this: this is a text that could serve as a superb introduction to Lacanian psychoanalysis, to be read while studying _Ecrits_ and the Seminar.  He begins by elaborating Lacan's ideas on the subject's entrance into language and the rules that govern the language as Other. Then he goes on to explicate the implications of this for subjectivity, ethics, sexuality, and psychoanalytic theory--all the while staying true to the clinical roots of these concepts. Fink provides clarification through the use of great examples, easy-to-follow schemas, a few of his own case histories, and by referring back to Freud's classic cases.  This book really helped me understand some key issues in Lacan's theoretical constellation. If you need help wrestling with Lacan's texts, _The Lacanian Subject_ is recommended. Also recommended: _A Clinical Introduction to Lacanian Psychoanalysis_ and _Lacan to the Letter_, both by Bruce Fink+books

Stilted and boring...+N+Just finished Emily Griffin's Something Borrowed then picked this one up right after...What a difference! Love at First Site is extremely boring right off the bat and the writing style is so painfully unnatural I couldn't make it past the first 40 pages. Griffin's debut, by comparison, is one of the best chick lit novels out there--very engaging with strong characters and lots of romantic suspense. Even if you like British chick lit authors as I do, don't bother with this one by Jane Moore+books
Excellent.  It sticks with you for decades.+P+Of all of the books that I read when I was a child, this is the only one that I truly never forget.  I have captivated the attention of my friends and their children by reciting some of the best verses.  The rhyme and  meter is exquisite, providing an almost musical theme through each episode.   The vocabulary is perfect for young people and fun for adults.  It  utilizes advanced words, while not burying their meaning from beginning  readers.  The characters lend themselves to creative new voices for each  reader to explore. All of theses remarkable qualities, and it maintains a  serious lesson for young people, that guns are not for fooling around+books

For Aspiring "Bark"itects +P+As a lifelong cat lover, I normally would not have glanced at this book, but my nephew, now a Jr. in high school, has chosen Architecture as his career. That, plus his love of dogs, caused me to have a look at the contents of this book as a possible fun gift for him. Glad I did! The imagination, the styling, the artistry, and of course, the LOVE that obviously went into the creation of this book, proved to be a great gift choice for my nephew. Even if there area no canines sharing your life, this would be a great coffee-table book to keep on display for friends and guests to enjoy+books
Replica of her Amanda Quick's Scandal+N+If you've read her Amanda Quick novels, this contemporary story is almost the exact replica of the novel, "Scandal".  Heroine proposes to hero, who has a hidden agenda. Of course he's rich and he has almost the same history as "Scandal", whose father has gotten into debt and gets out of the picture leaving the family to deal w/ the debt, and the oldest child having to pay back debts that his father's friends/business associates want paid right away.  Of course hero grows up and wants vengence for this when he grows up. But his plans get waylaid when heroine interferes and convinces hero that vengence is not the right path.  The book is so similar that a couple of times I caught myself looking at the cover to make sure I had the right book. The only difference in this book is that one is set in contemporary times and the other in historical time+books
Pure Shlock+N+I generally don't enjoy reading books with teenaged legs and sunflowers on the cover.  I often read on the subway, and it can be a bit embarassing.  If I chose to weather the pornographic implications of such cover art, I expect to be rewarded for my sacrifice--with, say--A GOOD BOOK.  I'd even settle for full characters who change and grow.  I'd settle for dialogue that occasionally rose above tediousness and pointlessness--perhaps dialogue that, in fact, advanced the plot or advanced character development.  If I am going to sit on the L train with a book that slightly resembles a Baby-Sitters Club Epic, I would like for that book to be enriching/rewarding/entertaining/redeeming.  Why is this book 400 pages long??!!!!  Nothing happens.  The family has the same conversations over and over again, and nothing ever changes, and the father character is so irresponsibly designed that his dialogue is virtually identical to that of her 31-year-old boyfriend, Oliver.  No one comes alive, except maybe the mother.  I found almost nothing to hold on to in the entire novel.  The opening line was intriguing.  From there on out, it becomes progressively worse.  I felt only for one person: the mother.  Because she sat in the background, hands folded meekly, kind of depressed and annoyed, for the entire book.  Which was a lot like how RR made me feel, too+books
Freedom Train: A Boring Book About A Slave+N+This isn't a very good book. It might be good if you're in love with history and you like reading 'Harriet freed slaves. She took them to Canada.' over and over again. Someone would read this and think Harriet Tubman was boring. If this is Harriet Tubman's life, then my life is cool. In other words,beware. This book is only for school reports. I wouldn't say this is a good book by any means. It's like being in slavery when you're reading this. I'd do math homework before this even crossed my mind+books
Great for Newlyweds!!+P+Since I have been married I have fallen in love with my Crock-Pot!  We both work and it is just the most wonderful thing to come home in the evening and already have dinner ready to go.  Sometimes it just doesn't seem worth the effort to cook for just the two of us, but the Crock Pot always makes it just SO easy.  Using my Crock-Pot has saved us SO much money by not eating out, and the ingredients that this book calls for are very inexpensive for the most part.  It is also much healthier than eating out several nights a week.  The best part of this book is that you can always find a recipe that sounds great and you have all the stuff that you need for it in the house.  Really, all it takes is five minutes in the morning to throw it all in the Crock-Pot and then you have a great dinner!  I almost always just put the meat in there straight from the freezer and just add an hour or so of cooking time.  This would be a great gift for a shower or housewarming.  Overall, it is a very simple book that always produces tasty and healthy dinners+books
Oh Danny Boy...+N+First off, I love Dan Rather. He's a wonderful, passionate man whom I love to watch on the news. The problem is, he's not a writer. Not a very good one at least. This book is a noble attempt, but there is just so much that's wrong with it.  For one thing, there is just some bad writing in it. It has a lot of errors in fact and a lot of typos. Among others, he writes that Texas A&M University (rather than Texas Tech) is in Lubbock, and he says that Ryne Sandberg in in the Baseball Hall of Fame (he just should be soon). There is also bad grammar (this is beyond the Texas colloquialisms in the book which I think are fine-I'm a Texan myself). These are fairly small problems, but they are oftly annoying, and they are not good signs in a book written by a journalist who's supposed to report facts. Furthermore, he just has few narrative talents, at least not those required for a book. He tells the stories as a journalist on Headline News would--concise, to the point, and without much flavor. They're just there; the reader is rarely drawn in.  The most glaring flaw, though, is that there are a lot of flaws in logic in the book. For instance, one of the stories is about a ten-year-old boy who realizes that many of the underpriveleged at his school cannot afford school supplies, so he works together an organization that collects and disperses those needed supplies. This is all obviously a good thing. But then, Rather relates a joke told by the boy's mother who said she needed to haul the school supplies around so she "traded in [her] Lexus for a Durango, and now [she's] getting a Yukon because the Durango isn't big enough." My problem is the huge contrast here. On one hand, there are all of these kids lacking necessities and the heroes who are helping them are laughing about purchasing one expensive SUV after another for themselves. How is this inequality emblematic of the American Dream? How does this book manage to lament the rising poverty rates and terrible living conditions and still manage to promote excessive materialism? There are some people in the book who are praised for having overcome hardship to make millions (some of them stepping on other people's heads to do so) and others who are praised for having given up millions to help those in need. Frankly, these two "ideals" don't go together. Nevertheless, these people, according to Rather, have all attained the American dream. There are a lot of contradicting ideas expressed in these stories. Furthermore, I don't really think Rather has a great concept of what the American dream is. When Sister Sylvia Schmidt founds a homeless shelter in Tulsa, OK, I don't think she is following the American Dream. I think she's following dreams that go far beyond the American Dream, and I think she's rejecting the prevalent, primarily materialistic, concept of the American Dream of today's society.  I'm giving the book two stars because I like Dan Rather, and because some of the stories were rather inspiring. Neverthess, it's not a good book. I will continue to watch Dan Rather on tv, but I'm quite sure I won't read a book by him again+books
In order to survive Rebekah's family moved to America .+P+Land of Hope is a very realistic book.  It tells the reader about what it was like to be a Russian Jew traveling steerage class on a boat to Ellis Island. It also describes realistically what it was like to be a refuguee.  This is a very good book.  I would reccomend it to everyone who likes to  read. Tara Kavaler 5th grad+books
Interesting at first, but...+N+...upon actual research it is clearly false. Many others have delved into the finer points of Menzies' poor methodology and often deliberate exaggeration or falsities, so I won't bother. I'll only list four points that I think stand out even without deep fact checking:  1)Niccolo di Conti, the venetian explorer and crucial link in the book who supposedly sailed with the Chinese treasure fleet in 1421, failed to mention in his memoirs anything about Chinese junks or going to the four corners of the world. This seems strange.  2)The Fleet sailed to virtually every coastline in the world but missed Europe entirely, the one place sure to mark their passing for posterity. This is neither evidence nor disproof, merely a sketchy coincidence.  3)Native Americans are given startlingly short shrift, both in the book and in many of the reviews. Virtually every time something sophisticated is presented in the ancient new world it is attributed to the Chinese, reminding me of the Easter Island "mystery" of who carved those giant heads. For the record, Native populations weren't childish savages; prior to European contact they had very sophisticated civilizations, fully capable of jewelery work, cloth garments, and carving statues.  4)Lastly, Given the vast numbers of Chinese sailors involved(roughly 25-30,000), the presence of domesticated animals such as horses and pigs, and the inevitable presence of huge numbers of stow-away rats, doesn't it strike anyone as odd that there were apparently no diseases passed on to the various native populations in the Americas? It only took a very small amount of European contact to spark the largest, and deadliest pandemic in history that raged for nearly two centuries killing unknown millions of Native Americans. Chinese contact of the scale claimed would certainly have had a similar, if not worse, effect.  Ultimately Menzies' book is entertaining, leaving the reader hoping it is true merely for the fantastic nature of the thesis. In the end, however, the evidence and analysis simply are not there. +books
The distinct, distinguished Catholic voice from the South+P+I haven't read anything by Flannery O'Connor since "All Things That Rise Must Converge." I fell in love with her stories. There is so much life in them. I read this work to get an idea about her "sitz im leben", her life-situation, her milieu. A lot of it is correspondence, and there are some presentations as well. I am wondering if it speaks to the modern would-be novelist as much as it spoke to writers of her time and place. She says that one needs to write out of the context of where you are: the place, the people, the geography. This is mandatory, not optional.   This book is for writers. I appreciate her writing about how to be Catholic in the South, a very small minority. She has contributed much to finding faith in the stories of life, even violent and brutal stories. I look forward to my next work of hers+books
Its value thus is twofold: as a biography for Welles fans, and as a history of film industry operations and politics.+P+Mention the name Orson Welles and his most famous involvement - with the radio scare 'War of the Worlds' - immediately comes to mind; but for a deeper understanding of Welles' life and career you need What Ever Happened to Orson Welles?: A Portrait of an Independent Career. His later projects were largely self-financed and erratically distributed, but film critic and biographer Joseph McBride has a personal familiarity with Welles from previous projects worked on with him and here shows how the Hollywood studio system forced Welles out of the industry. Its value thus is twofold: as a biography for Welles fans, and as a history of film industry operations and politics.  Diane C. Donovan California Bookwatc+books

Perfect story Post Katrina+P+My children have had to deal with tremendous unexpected changes in our lives as our home was destroyed by Hurricane Katrina.  One day we were in a home and my four year olds were just getting settled into school.  The next day we were living 500 miles away from home, their home was destroyed, and they were placed in new schools.  This story was perfect in explaining to them that change happens to everyone.  Sometimes these changes are very unexpected.  If we are willing to embrace change we can make this change an opportunity rather than a tragedy.  Wonderful principles to teach to kids.  My wife and I learned from it also+books
Tiel Tips on this book+N+For some great advice email me at humorgirl86@hotmail.com. I have owned a cockatiel for 8 years and have alot of expierience. This book is informative on housing, feeding, breeding and healing. It has great  pictures but, it's not the pictures that make the book it's the words! It  doesn't go into great detail about everything. It hardly has a page on  training and that doesn't even help if at all. Sure it may seem good but  once you read it, it really isn't that good at all. I say that you should  go to the pet store or book store and actually read the book or scan it to  make sure that it has what you want. Petsmart and Petco are great pet  stores that have plenty of books and all the needs for a cockatiel+books
Lindskold is back on track+P+In the fourth installment in Jane Lindskold's ongoing Wolf series,  the heroine Firekeeper, her sentient wolf companuion Blind Seer, and her friend Derian Carter have all been kidnapped and taken to a nation called Loglimi well south of the locales of their previous adventures.  The Loglimish are aware of the intelligence of the 'royal beasts' Firekeeper was raised by, and the creatures play an important part in their religion; so the prospect of being able to establish through Firekeeper better communication with the wise beasts is enticing and, at the same time, potentially threatening to many Loglimi.  As in the opener of the series, Firekeeper's entry into the court, or in this case temple, produces considerable friction.  Firekeeper is soon busy investigating the strange relationship between the Loglimi and their animals; at the same time (and the reader may have to stretch a bit to accept this development) she learns more of her own background.  And there are, of course, nefarious plots underway which require the unique talents of Firekeeper, Blind Seer, and Derian to defeat them.   No time is wasted in setting up the story; the capture takes place before the first page.  As a result, the other continuing characters from the series aren't present at all.  But the removal to a new location avoids the feeling of staleness that crept into the previous volume.  That makes this the best book in this series since the first+books
Sorry, not that great, get the other books+N+I'm as big a fan of "The Adventures of the Mad Scientists' Club" and "The New Adventures of the Mad Scientists' Club" as anyone is.  I loved those books to death as a kid, and even today, as I re-read the first two books, they're still as funny and clever as I remember-- my memories are not clouded by nostalgia.  I became a scientist (for real) because of those two books.  However, "The Big Ker-Plop", despite a promising beginning, just isn't as good.  It starts out great: it's wonderful to be with the boys again as they go fishing on a foggy morning in Strawberry Lake, and somethign BIG falls from the sky and lands somewhere in the water... To be back on Strawberry Lake again with these brainy, energetic boys is terrific, and right away there's a mystery to solve.  The boys enlist the aid of Henry Mulligan to find the object that fell in the lake, and how they do it-- using some trigonometry and a magnetometer-- is described with scientific accuracy, believeable, clever and entertaining.  It's such a relief to have a plot where problems are solved by something other than Harry Potter's wand.  But after the boys tell the Air Force where they found the object, the plot seriously bogs down.  For all intents and purposes, the boys aren't really involved in the plot thereafter, except as observers and (maybe) engineers.  The boys just invent solutions to problems-- and they are clever solutions, described with scientific accuracy.  But the Air Force does all the "action", and the boys just watch them through a telescope as the adults try to retrieve the lost atomic bomb.  I understand that it's realistic that the Air Force would go after a lost atomic bomb themselves, and would not let any civilians anywhere near the site-- yes, realistic, but it makes for a boring story.  It's not fun anymore when the adults do all the work.  The adults are an important part of the story, and the adult characters are all paper-thin cliches (the good-hearted Air Force colonel, the hard-bitten reporter, the fat news photographer), uninteresting.  Brinley was a brilliant plotter, able to write plausible real-world stories with clever twists-- but he had a major defect as a writer: he loved to write "clever" dialogue full of ripostes and "witty" put-downs, which in fact were never clever or funny.  The adults do a LOT of talking in this book-- whole chapters consist of their dialogue-- and when the idiot mayor of Mammoth Falls is engaging in "clever" repartee with the barber or some other adult, the witticisms are so unfunny, it just makes me wince+books
A great book for me at this time in my life+P+I am in the infant stages of my conversion to Judaism, and this book really cemented my conviction that this is the right decision for me.  I felt that Rabbi Kushner clearly explained what Judaism is all about to him and, in many instances, to me as well.  The chapter dealing with the dietary laws I found particularly helpful and enlightening, as this is one of the most intimidating factors for me in converting to Judaism and living as an observant Jew.  Rabbi Kushner's explanations helped me understand the dietary laws in a different way, as allowing the sacred to enter into mealtimes -- which takes the focus off food -- and I immediately began "keeping kosher" to an extent.    I didn't feel that this book slammed Christianity, but I'm not a Christian so my perspective is decidedly one-sided.  I did feel that this is a book about Judaism, not about Christianity.  There are places where Rabbi Kushner compares and contrasts the two religions, but I didn't get the sense that he was saying, "Our way is better than your way."  I DID get the sense that he is a man who feels deeply connected to God, and sees his religion as the source of that connection.  While it's likely that a (relatively) small number Christians would read this book, it seems to be intended for Jews -- a book for Jews about Judaism, written by a Jew.  The references to Christianity did not seem to be an instruction guide on Christianity so much as a way for Jews to understand their own religion within the context of modern American society, which is predominantly Christian.  If you are interested in learning more about Judaism -- what do Jews believe? what is the Jewish religion all about? -- then I think this is a very good introduction.  Rabbi Kushner's explanations are easy to read and understand and at the same time very enlightening.  Don't let this be the extent of your studies into Judaism, but it is a fine place to start+books
Disappointing :(+N+I enjoyed the movie Claire of the Moon, but when I read the book I found it to be a bit sophomoric.  I am not a fan of "cookie cutter" type novels and She Walks in Beauty would definately fall into that catagory in my opinion.  Even if I had mounds of free time I would not spend much of it on this book, it's an extreme let down. +books
HORRIBLE!!+N+This was the first book I had ever read by this author, and I can sincerely state I will not read another.  The way the characters described what the others were doing in conversation was ridiculous. No one - and no one, speaks that way. It made the story feel rushed and stilted, and I am sad to say, much of the humor was lost on me. Something funny being told to you is not as funny as witnessing it. I felt the situations would have been much humorous if she described what was happening instead of having her characters describe it in their dialogues. I found it offensive that the women were protrayed by the men as being silly (something that made me wonder what it was exactly the men saw in them other then the prospect of having sex with them), and the abuse situations Ms. Coulter touched on, then so neatly wrapped up with two of the characters being so heroic was disgusting. She should have never touched on such deep subjects and solved them with MORE physical violence. The conclusion to this still very real problem rubbed me completely the wrong way. If she was trying to make a social statement on the issue - she failed....miserably. Reading this book was an utter loss of time. Don't bother+books
It's good...Even for men+P+I know this may sound weird in light of the fact that Powter has been labeled fem-nazi and the like, but she has a new male convert in me due to the Sober and Staying That Way.  It completely changed my view of her. I read the book non-stop from front to back.  I immediately identified with the sugar/caffeine cravings whenever I tried to stop drinking.  I knew/know from personal experience that eating/being healthy really helps me not drink.  And I readily identified with her observations about current recovery programs.  I was in some shock over the connections she makes between the government and big business, but that was naive on my part.  This book really simulated a response from me on many levels.  It may have saved my life and possibly my marriage+books
What does the turkey have to do with this mystery?+N+I was disappointed in this book.  I had started getting these books on CD from the library amd thoroughly enjoyed the first few I listened to.  I enjoy the author's picturesque, almost poetic, descriptions of things.  Those descriptions were still there, but they did not connect well.  The mystery of the person murdered becomes an incidental by-line, not really crucial to the other goings-on in the story.  There is no expanation to why the return of the turkeys is of any significance and what do the cats' being able to communicate with them have to do with anything in the story line.  I felt very let down at the end of this audio book+books
Super Healthy diet book+P+This book may be the very best diet book on the market. It gives you healthy sources of protein, it teaches you to balance your macronutrients, protein, carbs, and healthy fats. It recommends only the healthiest foods to eat.It works!!!  I went from 209 pounds to 151 pounds with the principles of this book. Once you understand how insulin works against you to store fat,and learn the right amount of protein and carbs your body needs to maintain your ideal weight, you can begin your journey to eat in the zone and lose weight.It has been my eating guidelines for almost 10 years. It is well worth the trouble to learn to treat food as a drug.  BUY THIS BOOK IF YOUR ARE SERIOUS ABOUT WEIGHT LOSS, IT WILL SHOW YOU THE WAY+books

Liberating+P+I'm updating my review, because I think the first draft was skimpy, and I feel like I have a better view of this book now that more time has passed since my first reading.  The crux of the book is Guskin's concept of "taking it off the page."  This was extremely valuable to me, and it turned cold readings from being scary to being my favorite part of the acting process!  "Taking it off the page" is applicable to rehearsals, too, though, and to freshening up ongoing performances.  The book lightly touches on a lot of different types of acting: Auditions, Rehearsals, Sit-Coms, Serials, Small Roles, Big Roles, Touring, Film Acting.  I think Guskin wants to explain briefly what you need to do differently for each of these situations.  The book is too short to teach all details for any of these, though, so you will need other sources.  The book is very important to me, and my first experience with it was that I read it, and my very next rehearsal was the best rehearsal I had ever had.  I felt so free, it was amazing.  That is his main objective, to free you up to enjoy and explore.+books
Lower Than Low+N+After finishing The Thread That Runs So True by Jesse Stuart, I sit here to give you my review on this book. Even though the book didn't catch my attention that much it had its ups and downs.  The only thing  that caught my attention while reading this book was how he fought back against the "man" and got his job back, but then he stuck it to them at the end. As for the down points of the book it would have to be the rest of the book. I could not in a million years honestly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a book to read+books
Fabric of Faith: A Guide to the Prayer Quilt Ministry+N+Very disappointed in the contents of this book. I expected more information and patterns+books
Not Anne Rice at her best...+N+I may be repeating what others have said in previous reviews, but I just had to vent over this book. After reading Interview with the Vampire, and the other Vampire Chronicles before Merrick, I was highly disappointed over this book. The action and references to Voodun were vague and boring. The book revolves around a plot concocted by David Talbot and Louis the Vampire to use Merrick in order to contact the ghost of Claudia. Then, the book moves into this tedious tangent over the life of Merrick Mayfair, a character Anne Rice fails to develop as a complex individual. The action in this book is cheesy, typical, and EXTREMELY predictable. The book introduces characters that are related to Merrick, and it is not difficult to guess the fate of these characters as a reader. The vampires are barely portrayed as the mysterious, yet dangerous, and bloodlusting characters they once were in the previous novels. The vampires in Merrick, especially Louis, are portrayed as weak and gutless. Yes, Louis is a tortured soul, but his portrayal is severely watered down in this novel, and his weak nature is irritating to read about. Compare the vampires in Merrick to the same vampires portrayed in Queen of the Damned, like the characters of Akasha and Kayman, who enjoyed "devouring the marrow from their victims' bones". The vampires in Anne Rice's previous books captured the reader's attention with their viciousness, and vengeaful, yet human qualities. Anne Rice did not seem to balance these qualities in the novel Merrick as she did in her others. The action in this novel is painfully slow and without direction. The book is also full of references to David's annoying, perverse tendencies that were written merely to try to increase book sales. Skip this novel, and move on to one of her other vampire chronicles, preferrably her early novels. This just does not cut it+books
A Very Dull Read+N+It goes like this...hero muses, is followed, takes a meeting, phones, travels, phones, takes a meeting, travels, phones, takes a meeting, phones, travels, takes a meeting, etc, etc. If this is what makes for a good novel, it's all yours. I don't care if this is how they do it in real life in the CIA, it's damn dull reading. The real mystery with this novel is why it ever got good reviews+books
Women is a great, candid, easy to read, crazy book!!+P+Bukowski writes so well in such an easy to read style that it is hard to put the book down. So I ended up reading this book in about a week. I'm reading Ham on Rye now and it's the same thing, addicting. You can't put the darn thing down because you want to see what happens next. He's like a print version of a reality-show.+books
Please Keep Writing+P+I thought this was a very solid follow up to Gorky Park.  The characters lot in life and situation make since to me.   The same strong character building comes through to thus book and that dark, a bit desperate feel is there also.   I look the feel of the book, in describing the fishing ship - I can smell it, the description is that good.  I also liked the story, I was wondering how he was going to give us a fulfilling murder mystery to solve and he did it.  If you liked his last book in this series then you will really like this one+books
Great with tea and obligatory biscuit+P+George Orwell, writer of such great classics as &quot;No Winston, two plus two is five&quot; and &quot;All animals are equal&quot; truely outdid himself with this book.  His essay, &quot;Such, and Such Were the Joys,&quot; is worth the price of the book alone.  The descriptions therein, in the vein of 1984, are detailed and vivid to the point where I almost feel as if I remember and understand Orwell's childhood better than my own.  In this essay one also catches a glimpse of what made Orwell the writer he was: a poor, pessimistic, sickly lad whose talent could have created it's own entire cannon if he'd lived longer and enjoyed a more work conducive atmosphere.  For every reader who breathes to read, this book is an oxygen tank. (like the one they have at the bottom of the slopes in Aspen.+books
Excellent!  Heart Warming, tear-jerker+P+This book made me realize that there are still good people in this world.  When everything seems to be going wrong and hatred between mankind seems to be the controlling factor in society, it helps to see the generosity of selfless people+books
A Great book for the Early Childhood Classroom+P+This book helps you look at the big picture from beginning to end. Nature should exist in the classroom all year around. I love the open ended growing activities and setting up a growing center. I'm in the process of doing this in my classroom and the children love it. Check out their other books on structures and water too!+books
Have you ever PAID for a brochure?+N+Look.  They got tired of trying to explain to their customers exactly what their products are and how they work, so they wrote a book to educate and sell them.  It's basically a hardback brochure.  I'm sure they give it to all their hot prospects.  But we the little people get to PAY for it.    There is some useful info on leading indicators but nothing you couldn't find elsewhere free.  And once they teach you which of their magic proprietary indicators to keep an eye on, guess what?  You're supposed to sign up for a subscription to get them, not even the simplest of the data is available free althought the book implies they are.   Booksellers need to stop carrying this kind of 'gotcha' book+books
Disappointed+N+First, let me state that I have read hundreds of books and have never written a bad review. This book is an exception.   I purchased this book hoping to read facts regarding women on plantations. I was disppointed as this book is based mainly on the writer's view versus historical facts. The book covers the period of 1780-1835. However, the author on multiple occasions refers to the Civil War period. Too much "bouncing" around throughout the years.   Yes, she does quote portions of historical letters but I felt these were used most likely out of context in order to support the writer's point of view without actual facts cited.  The writer's negativity toward other books written on plantation mistresses and their authors, which she refers to frequently in the book, are deplorable. Why mention them at all. It only makes one want to read the books that she things so little of.  Harsh...yes perhaps this review is harsh. Bottom line, I read the book and would not recommend it as good factual reading. +books
Keys to Drawing and Seeing+P+This book tells us the importance of seeing rather than drawing. In most cases the how-to book tells only about the methods, but such methods will not keep overnight. But the author of this book knows the real nature of drawing, so he advises us to draw without watching. This is the wonderful book +books
An unwieldy translation+N+In a nutshell: Don't waste your money on this version.  The original version of this translation dates to just after the turn of the century, but the introduction and further editing by Anatol Rapaport (a biologist and a musician, not a political scientist or historian), make this a clumsy read at best and downright misleading at worst.  Rapaport, for being an editor of Clausewitz, was not a believer in the trinitarian system (primordial violence, non-rational actions, and rationality)- probably not a good choice for a work which owes as much as it does to the first and second Trinities (army, people, and government).  If this is the only one you can get, then live with it.  The first chance you get, get the much clearer, much more straightforward Paret/Howard translation, which is the one that's actually taught at most service schools as well as in universities in their courses that use it+books
The Book of Wisdom for the Ages+P+Maha means great and Yoga means a path of reunion. Here the Great Path is outlined and explained in a truly timeless and masterful way. Written by a direct disciple of the great Ramana Maharshi, this is a very important guide book for the seeker of Ultimate Reality. First published in 1937, with numerous printings since then, this book is as fresh and new as a perfect spring morning. Chapters include The Sage, The World, God, The Quest, The Egoless State, and much more. For the modern day nondualist seeker, this is a treasure chest of spiritual wisdom. The author declares that we all, consciously or unconsciously, are always looking for the Supreme Beatitude of the egoless state, i.e., direct knowledge of the One, the Self. To quote a bit from the book: &quot;The right thing to do is not to go on framing questions and seeking answers...but to arrest the culprit, the ego, put him in the dock, and dispose of him by the Quest of the real Self, which he pretends to be. In other words, one should discover the real Self, who is the final answer to all questions. Every question that arises is vitiated by the ignorance which takes the ego at its face value, as the real Self. All questions are therefore reducible to one, 'Who am I?'. This question is the Quest of the Self, by which the egoless state is won.&quot; For the person who's ears are ready to hear, this book is sweet music indeed!!+books
Halley's Bible Handbook+P+This book is a must if you are studying the Bible. Explanations are given of facts, verses, people and places as you go from one Book in your Bible to the next. I found out about it in Bible study class. My Senior Pastor, has a copy he got over 40 yrs ago, and still used. One of the best studying guides you can have in your library+books
Delicious, with a Wee Aftertaste+P+Even in paperback this is a thick and heavy book, which is a compilation of several of MKF Fisher's individual works offering different aspects of her thoughts on food in terms of origin, recipes, culinary preparation, and history. In addition, it divulges her own observations on the whole dining experience that we as humans go through in terms of customs, etiquette, ambience, socializing and so forth. But what makes this book stellar is the eloquent, imaginative, and sometimes even haunting style of Ms. Fisher's writing. She expresses her own thoughts and oftentimes outspoken opinions, mixing them with historical facts, tempting recipes, and home-cooked tales. With such a satisfying horn of plenty within the confines of two book covers, it is easy to understand why she still reigns as the queen of prose inspired by food and dining. I wish I had her ability to master in writing such joi de vivre and enthusiasm for food, eating, and drinking, which after all are such basic elements to our very existence.    The section I enjoyed most of all was "The Gastronomical Me", a biography-cum-travelogue in which she poignantly narrates her experiences by rendering them so lifelike that you can smell the smells and taste the tastes. She includes food episodes of her early years in California while growing up and later attending boarding school; in Dijon, France where the kitchens in restaurants and her apartments beckon you to partake of the offerings; in Switzerland where you visually can grasp the mountains and streams along train-rides she describes through the Alps to Italy; and finally in a small Mexican town, where she surpasses even the writing prowess demonstrated in her previous stories, by telling the most poignant tales.   An interesting sidelight is that this book not only covers food. You gather early on that she is far from a teetotaler since alcoholic drinks and drinking at mealtimes too are frequent topics, from sipping wines and champagnes and glasses of Pernod on ocean liners to mixing water with bourbon, which she keeps in a flask during a long, propeller-driven, airplane flight to Mexico.   The other sections I liked were the beginning (Serve It Forth) and Consider the Oyster. It amazed me that one person could write a whole expose covering around a hundred pages about only the oyster: the various types, methods of preparations, and culinary history. Plus she gives her own personal memories and anecdotes too. You name it, she said it about oysters--recipes included.   I did not care as much for How to Cook a Wolf, as I could not relate to either the off-color humor or to some of the topics she presented. (Sorry, but sweetbreads, halves of calf heads, and brains were not appetizing subjects.) Also, I gave up finishing the book. I started to read "An Alphabet for Gourmets", the last section, but got as far as "D" and couldn't force myself to read through the rest of the alphabet. It seems to me by the time in her life when she wrote this section she had become rather cynical and bitter, to the extent that everything she wrote sounded condescending. This section was such a let-down, a depressant to me after coming off the high of "The Gastronomical Me". Although I exaggerate, she seemed to repeatedly state something to the effect that she preferred to dine alone on crackers and milk rather than face gourmet meals with uncultivated people (with untrained palettes) who were unsavvy as to the proper way food should be eaten in the first place and incapable of appreciating what they shoved in their faces in the second. Anyway, other readers may disagree with me, but this last section lacks the consistency, and more important, the vibrancy and pep of her flowing, off-the-wall style that grows on you in the other sections.    Although I was a little disheartened at the end, her brilliance that shone through in the other sections more than outweighed the few negatives.  I can recommend this book to everyone, especially to people who are interested in food as a literary subject in its own right instead of something that we simply cook and eat. Of course, foodies and cooks alike should appreciate it. And though it does have some very good recipes as added bonuses, this should not be considered a cookbook; instead, this book's function is to serve up delicious tidbits for our minds and imaginations to savor and enjoy. +books
The First of a Great Series+P+At first blush, the Everard family doesn't look like much on which to base a series of heroic sailors. Hugh, drummed out of the service before the war in some unnamed scandal but pulled back in because of the emergency, is in love with his brother John's wife. John, a general in the army in France, does not make an appearance, but his sons Nick and David do. Nick is feckless and irresponsible, just one step ahead of being drummed out of the Royal Navy himself, while David is more professional if somewhat dull. That in the course of the book, one's opinion of everyone changes 180 degrees is a tribute to the author's skill at both showing character development and also at revealing a character's past layer by layer, like peeling an onion.  The criticism commonly made about this book merely shows the inability of some critics to appreciate the intent of the book they are reviewing. Yes, the book is choppy and yes, it is hard to follow the course of the action. One's initial impulse is to wish for maps and an appendix, but then you realize that this is the whole point. Fullerton's goal is to present to the reader exactly how fighting the Battle of Jutland felt to those who were there. Jutland was a confusing battle and it was many days before those who were there had the foggiest notion of the sequence of events. Fullerton has studied the battle carefully and everything that happened in real life happens here at exactly the same time. But you can't construct a coherent whole out of the narrative, just as even Lord Jellicoe wasn't able to do so. For that, you need to consult another book (I would recommend Rules of the Game by Andrew Gordon, which is not only the finest description of the battle, but one of the finest works of military history), but do it after you read this book, so that you get the full flavor of the writer's intent.   Very few writers capture the fog of war as well as Fullerton does+books
sanitised edition+N+I do agree that books containing racist positions should not be given to children without a strong and fully aware comment. But I simply cannot stand to buy a sanitised version of a book without being aware of it. This is called censorship, and it gives me the creeps. As a parent, I have had enough real life opportunities to prove racism wrong to my children. So to realise that somebody has been cheating on me, trying to do my job so that I did not have to explain how society has evolved, how difficult it has been for minorities to be recognised and respected is just a fraud. this review is about the Harper collins Edition , edited by Patricia C. and Frederick L. McKissak, illustrated by Michael Hague+books
It's how we remember+P+I, like most of my women friends I've talked to, including my mother and my sisters, shape memories and moments based on the clothes we were wearing at the time.   I bought this book in 1995 when it was first published and have referred to it several times over the years for inspiration and support. I found it in the "Self-Help" section of the bookstore.  This little book does as good a job as anything I've read, at getting in a woman's head. Clothes are how we remember. Wearing our favorite clothes or shoes or carrying our favorite handbag gives us confidence and helps us cope.   For a while, I kept a diary of drawings of outfits whenever I'd want to remember an important event. Ask me what I was wearing when I held my niece for the first time (navy blue A-line Liz Claiborne dress) or when I went to my first job interview out of college (a polka-dot suit I called The Stewardess) or the night I was first kissed by the love of my life (a shirt that said "Keep On Truckin" in glitter... heh).  A good friend's mother passed away a few months ago, and I bought a copy for her, since Ms. Beckerman mentions the death of her own mother. She also mentions marriages, divorces, babies, and career successes, and most importantly, what she wore.  It makes a great gift for any woman. Or for yourself+books
Not bad....+N+This was not a wonderful story, but it was good enough that a kid who already knows he/she has AD/HD would probably enjoy it. It's about a boy who has problems with impulsivity, forgetfulness, and distracability, but  manages to make progress and become a better friend+books
Extremely useful+P+Great for anyone taking Partial differential equations, mathematical physics, and the related courses. Carl Bender is a master of the field as well as a great book writer, as well as Orszag. The only complaint is the type setting--a bit too small. But not a big proble+books

Chess Memoirs of Being With the Greats!+P+This book goes behind the scenes of the professional and amateur world of organized chess. It is very entertaining because not many people (even die hard chess players themselves) have experiences of this nature in the realm of chess politics. The man has done it all and it was fun to read about his spectacular path! Mr. Schultz' love for chess is clear and his accounts of his chess past are entertaining. He tells of the good and he tells of the bad and a lot of humorous little anecdotes in between. If you play chess with any seriousness, this book is certainly an educational tool in terms of understanding how the big organizations like FIDE and USCF operate. However, this book is very suitable for non-chessplayers as well in that there is no actual chess positions or analysis. It is a story of a man's chess life and political career and I found it to be well done+books
Awful book on its own for complete beginner+N+I wanted to teach my son to program and chose VB and this book.  This book really "looks" great but I'm not impressed by the content. So much so that it compelled me to write my first ever book review.  The introduction "Who Is This Book For?" gives a sense that this book can get people into programming.   I would be amazed however if anyone not familiar with programming will get past Chapter 1 without being frightened by the whole prospect of programming.  Chapter 1 initially jumps into some Microsoft marketing of .Net which really adds nothing but confuses the readers by having to deal with line after line of computer jargon.  Then the chapter gives a horrible overview of Object Orientation which again doesn't help later.  I feel the whole book is like the first chapter. Doesn't give you some of the basics but rambles about more complex stuff you don't need between some hands on practical stuff.   I actually thought the first example was really poor also.  I am of the opinion that someone typing something in themselves and seeing it work should be rewarding.  The example however was hard for a novice as it had long lines of comments and the line to print the variables was a minefield of quotes and symbols making it pretty likely that a beginner would do a typo.    The title of the book is "Build a Program Now!".  This the book does and given how complex setting up an environment it is helpful.  But I've slammed the rating of this book because this could have covered with a lot less pages and maybe substitute some of the drivel with a little about the syntax of VB or even some explanation of the example code.  DON'T buy this book if you think it will teach you anything about computing or programming.  DO buy this book if you have some other teaching reference for Visual Basic and want something that will help you setup your build environment.  Also comes with a VB Express CD so you don't have to downloaded it.  +books
Discworld+P+I've decided he's too good and too prolific for me to write a brand new review every single time I read one of his books. Discworld currently has 34 titles and every one of them will probably knock your socks off. His mind bubbles and flashes like a boiling pot of electric eels, and I simply can't get enough of his writing.   A reviewer has compared him to Geoffrey Chaucer. He reminds me more of Douglas Adams, or perhaps S Morgenstern. Great company, isn't it? He's an extremely skillful and imaginative writer, damn funny, clever and observant to boot. He's also very easy to read. A master of characterization, and if there's anything else you like about reading that I didn't mention here, assume I simply forgot. He's awesome.   Another reviewer mentioned Jonathan Swift and PG Wodehouse. Why such hallowed company? Because Pratchett belongs there! Truly, I'm enjoying my quest to read every book in the series. You should do the same, and begin your quest at the library because he's got to be there. He's awesome!   Yet another reviewer said Jerome K Jerome meets Lord of the Rings. Yeah, that works too.   Why do we, as reviewers, compare authors to other authors? Because it's easier than thinking. In the case of Terry Pratchett, it's probably because we'd otherwise wind up quoting the guy. He's so unique that we just don't know how else to cope with his greatness. Even this paragraph sounds like foamy drool raving, doesn't it? That's how all readers react to Pratchett. Reviewers simply don't have the good sense to keep it to themselves.   I could call his writing fantasy, but I could likewise call what Douglas Adams wrote science fiction. In both cases, I wouldn't be wrong, but I'd be neglecting so much and just totally missing the point. A rare few authors transcend a genre to such a degree that you know they're shouting out, loud and proud, a big fat "Bite me!"   I love Terry Pratchett's writing, and I completely understand why some folks refer to him as their favorite author. Or favourite, I should say, since we're being British. He's one of those authors that makes you want to grab whoever's in hearing range and start reading passages aloud. I'm simply thrilled that there's such an extremely talented and prolific author who's been working for years without me being aware of him. Now I have much catching up to do, and I will love it. +books
Great book, I loved it!+P+First, a word about the publishers. . . Somewhere it is decreed, I suppose in the Regency genre publishing house, that all "Regency Romance" books must be exactly 218 pages, no more and no less, so that if one author writes less, they make the letters nice and big, three paragraphs to a page. . . And if another author has a longer story, the publishers will squeeze ten paragraphs, in tiny letters, onto one page. . . This is one of the books where you have ten paragraphs (or more) per page, plus there is so much going on in the story that the plotline is constantly changing . . . for me, this made for some frustrating reading.  But as for the story itself - this is my first by Allison Lane, and what I see, I like.  I was pre-warned that she is a "darker" Regency author, so that I did not find the issues explored in this story shocking.  Yes, it's sad, but, unfortunately, there really are parents like that.  (Today, since arranged marriages are not really "done" it will play out in the form of career, or how their children should live their lives. . .)  As for the character of Reggie - he's a really nice, sympathetic character, but I'm afraid that his problem was a real one.  Maybe it's uncommon, and he seems to have had an unusually bad case of it, but it is only today that they have medication for these problems (those who have read the story know which medication I mean).    I loved the heroine!  I hate to say this, but she sounds so exactly like me, that how can I not have loved this story?  Miss Joanna Patterson was hired as a sort-of companion to Lady Harriet, to launch her into society - and to find her a husband, perferably a rich one.  Being rather plain, awkward, and bespecled besides, Joanna has no such hopes for herself.    Lord Sedgewick Wylie is not only a dandy, but he is the biggest dandy of them all - actually, he is a social leader.  Always, always, impeccably dressed, always with perfect manners, Lord Sedgewick is as different from Joanna as could possibly be.  But what society does not know, and would possibly ridicule if they did, is that under that dandified clothing is a smart and educated man - and he is starting to get bored with the society role that he is playing.  In short, this is a couple that is different as could possibly be, and would never have even looked at each other, if fate had not intervened, in not one, not two, but three separate "accidents" involving each other, the last one culminating in their forced marriage - although "marriage" for show, and "marriage" for real are two separate things entirely. . .   Quite early on in the book, I recognized the plot.  Yes, I was right.  This book has a similar plot to "The Viscount who Loved me" by Julia Quinn.  I checked the publishing dates to see "who cheated" but they were published quite closely together, actually this book was first. . . Maybe this is a fairly common Regency plot device, I haven't read enough Regency books to know if this is so or not.  And unlike some previous reviewers, I really liked the character of Lord Sedgewick.  He is a refreshing change from the rakes, and more rakes, that seem to populate all the Regency fare that I have read so far.  Although a dandy, he is responsible, and uses his position in society wisely - he actually tries to help people.  He is not a rake, nor does he gamble in excess, or drink etc. etc.  In short, in many ways a paragon.  And although he does treat the heroine badly at some point in the book, his reasons are very clear, and believable, to me.  Besides, once he gets over his initial reaction, he does apologize, and he even comes to an understanding within himself as to why he treated her this way, and how he will change in the future.  Hey, you can't ask for much better than that.  Even if I am the only one, I do see a very nice future for the rest of their lives together.  I like Allison Lane's style.  I like her complicated plots, I liked her *very" complex characters, and I especially liker her *very* realistic portrayal of the issues she has chosen to deal with in this Regency novel.  This is one smart lady, and I really enjoyed her writing.    I recommend this book for anyone who likes Regencies a bit *darker*, but more realistic, and especially for those who like complicated plots with full-fleshed characters, created by an extremely intelligent author+books
A great book to read in order to skip many+P+This is a great book to read so that you can skip the 4 boring ones before it and save yourself some agony.

The Only Book You Will Need!+P+I became a first time homeowner 2 years ago and I didn't know anything about gardening.  My friend recommended this book to me and it has been very educational.  It is the only book I reference when planning my garden.  This book is broken down by topic: Perennials, Annuals, Trees, Shrubs, etc.  It explains the differences between all the flowers and what environment is best for each flower/shrub/vine/trees.  The pictures are great!  There are pictures of almost every plant he describes. I have able to choose my flowers to plant each season from the book so when I go to the nursery I know exactly what I need+books
Not happy+N+I ordered this book twice, especially because the picture shows the book with a blue cover which is the Cambridge Press edition.The books I received were not from Canbridge Press and did not have the Appendix III which is the genealogy. These books came from paperbackshop in England. I feel that the genealogy is a very important part of this book and should always be included.+books
Donna+N+While I have just begun to enjoy this tremendous work that came highly recommended to me, I am already somewhat disappointed in the limited, male-oriented, patriarchal interpretation of some indisputably feminine symbols like the Minoan Great Mother Goddess referenced and pictured under the entry, AXE on page 16.  Described as a 'phallic' representation of her 'parthenogenetic fertility,' and as a, 'Solar emblem of the 'sky gods,' and later as an, 'emblem of Saint John the Babtist,' this is clearly a female iconic Goddess figure holding a double-sided LABRYS (axe) in each upraised arm.  The Labrys is a feminine symbol associated with the female Amazons that were Priestesses of Artemis, the Moon Goddess.  During their time, lunar energies were associated with the Goddess, and feminine power, NOT masculine, phallic, sky-Gods.+books
Self analysis, not food lit+N+I usually do not put aside a book before finishing it.  In this case, I got about a third of the way through and just skimmed the rest and could not bring myself to read it in detail.  I purchased this book hoping (despite prior reviews) that it was more food lit than self analysis.  However, the strength of this book is in its description of tense family relationships, and indeed not in its descriptions of food in Desalvo's life.  If you are interested in it anyway, good luck - there is a lot of emotion in it+books

Absolutely Normal Chaos+P+Have you ever read the book Walk Two Moons? If you have remember Mary Lou Finney , Mr. Birkway, and the journals he made them write and keep over the summer vacation. I love this book it is so amazing and wonderful. This book is about 13 year old girl named Mary Lou Finney that thinks that summer assignment is boring but how would she know that what started out as a boring summer homework would change her life and her. Her summer turns out to be the best summer ever. It all started with her cousin Carl Ray coming to stay over at her house to look for a job but the trith is that he is there to look for his real father, and her carzy beat freind Beth Ann who gets a crush on her cousin Carl Ray, also about "the jerk", and finally her one and only "love" Alex Cheevy who ends up being her boyfriend. This book is fantastic if you want to know more about it I suggest you read it. You will love it+books
Waste of time & money+N+The book is full of useless fillings. Finding your colors is limited to few hair and eye color combinations. It also depends on you doing a test with different colored fabrics & determing how the color reflect against your skin. After reading the book, I still don't know what my colors are. Besides, with so many different color hues on the market, how can one tell if what you're buying is an ever green or true green for example, confusing. The lack of pictures showing the types of collars they're recommending for different body types (e.g Mandarin collar,cowl,bardot...)...is annoying,to say the least. Questionnaires are poorly structured, & the section on makeup, underwear & accessories is trivial. Save your money (i'm glad the book I read was a borrow from the library) and save your time. Pass+books
not like her others+N+I, too, thought Turner's latest book was a bit on the boring side and not as good as her other books.  I found myself annoyed at the poetry throughout the book and thought it took away from the story of which was already hard to follow.  I did laugh a bit, but mostly from the fact that it seemed doubtful the author really had a notion of the subject in which she was writing+books
I quit the series...and I want my spent hours of reading back+N+Title says it all.  I enjoyed the 1st-3rd book in series.  Forth book sort of dragged.  By the middle of this book I had to make a decision...keep going with an endless supply of boring pages and books ahead or throw in the towel.  Let's face it, life's too short.  If you want a thousand pages of satisfaction pick up the unabridged version of "The Stand".  I'm afraid this doesn't do it.    Think about it another way do you want to read over 5000 pages of a series that has mixed reviews from like minded fantasy readers?  Cheer+books

The most useful cookbook ever+P+Many cookbooks are tempting to read but impractical to cook from every day. This one on the other hand is full of fast, easy, and delicious recipies that are great for kids and adults.

A witty, tongue-in-cheek romp.+P+Out on the Rim starts out delightfully enough.  The year is 1986, the place Washington, D.C.  Sixty year old counterterrorism expert Booth Stallings is hired by persons unknown to deliver a $5 million bribe to a troublesome Filipino rebel leader. But Stallings does not see himself as a mere delivery boy.  He'd much rather get his hands permanently on the 5 million.  Knowing he'll need some help and after consulting with his lawyer son-in-law, he takes on as partners Artie Wu and Quincy Durant.  Two lifelong friends who know their way around both the Far East and other people's money. By the time he gets to Manila, Stallings finds that he has four partners, not two.  You see, a con man named Otherguy Overby and an ex-Secret Service agent named Georgia Blue have cleverly insinuated themselves into the mix. Out on the Rim is an entertaining and complex tale of intrigue.  There's plenty of double crossing and lots of unexpected alliances turn up.  In fact, about two thirds of the way through, the complications start to get a bit out of hand.  And that is the book's main flaw. Written with wit and urbane humor, Out on the Rim is deliciously engaging.  But the number of twists and turns could have been 50% less without detracting at all from the fun. +books
Aramaic Translation+P+This translation is excellent for those people who thought, I didnt equate that verse with the character of God. There are no yes and no scriptures and this translation throws new light on the verses that didnt seem right in the King James. Bless God, Knowledge will indeed increase in these last days. +books
Wasted my money+N+The book is worthless.  It was extremely high level and should have been  titled &quot;configuring windows 2000 server security for dummies&quot;.   This book is not for anyone with Security or W2K experience....move one and  don't waste your time or money+books
ways for Loving Fully &amp; Living Freely+P+It is written from heart. There are lot of stories, real life events and observations. The single theme is GOD is love. In strict theological terms, it is vedantic or zen buddhist kind. In the chapter on Undoing  unworthiness, he rejects the sinner concept of Christanity. There are lot  of page length poems of deep meaning. There are some interesting diagrams.  It is a book one can read again and again atleast parts of it. Discussion  on Jesus in the chapter Dancin' up the path is interesting. It reminds  Capras's urge to equate Siva's dance and quantum vibrations+books
My Favorite Book!+P+I just got this book and i have already become obsessed with dreams of building my own Rolling Home this summer. The photographs are all very beautiful, and the book is also full of great drawings and diagrams. Not  much text, but what's there is very well written. This book has inspired me  to live my life in a whole new, fun way. This is definately worth buying+books
For Fishing Fanatics Only +N+Stienstra seems to think people only go camping to go fishing--it's clearly the reason he goes. A campsite could be a pit, but if there's trout nearby he gives it a high rating. He never lets you know if the water is swimmable (i.e. above 55 degress)--something people in Northern California need to know in the summertime. He also gives something a high rating if the area it is in is nice even if the campsites are horrible. I've been disappointed many times using his book, yet there is no real competition for his book as it's the only really comprehensive one on the market. I wish someone else would tackle (no fishing pun intended there Tom) this subject+books
A powerful flop!+N+The title of the Riddle of the Sands is exotic but beyond that - this is an unbelievably boring tale of two friends who come together at some godforsaken islands to reveal a British traitor.  That's the gist of the novel. But what follows is a convoluted storyline full of slang, garbled nautical lingo rendered in half completed sentences that have no head or tail. Understanding such a text will require a supercomputer not to speak of a mere mortal. The writer seems to have written this book in some opium-induced hallucinatory trance. This is a heck of a one-way trip to self-congratulatory egotism, if I ever saw on+books
not what was presented+N+while the history of Roger Bacon was interesting and the  other historic figures(Aristotle, Soccrates, etal) I was expecting more about the actual manuscript and how it was deciphered and those around that quest. Instead the book spends over 2/3s relating stories of how various famous figures interacted, political climates and philosophies. This is nice background but it could have been shortened, in this reader's humble opinion.   If you want to know more about the Manuscript, look to another book.+books
Starting to live again+P+I was recently diagnosed as having hepatitis c.  The immediate effect was shock and disbelief.  I was under the mistaken impression that the way a person contracted hep c was by IV drug abuse or a tainted blood transfusion.  This threw me for a loop since the only blood I had ever recieved was in 1950 and 1959 and I had never abused any drugs, I had no idea this virus existed back when I had recieved blood.  I was afraid to tell my family what I had and therefore had no support.  After reading this book not only did I have more information with which to approach my family but an idea of what to expect in my life from here on out.  It is seldom one finds an information type book that is written in a way that makes it an easy read but this one falls in that category.  Even those in the mid adolescent years would have no problem reading and understanding the information.  I have already purchased a copy of this book to give my daughter when I tell her that I have this disease+books
Better late then never+P+Well written and easy to read.  The book fills in the gaps leading to retirement and allows one to make up for lost time in looking at things that need to be considered for retirement+books
Inspirational for anyone who reads this book+P+I find Chuck Norris's story amazing because no matter what anyone else said he worked towards and achieved his goals. An interesting concept of this is how he always shows respect and a smile on his face to everyone he meets, even people who scower at him.  He does this because its a proven fact that if you fight someone's negative attitude with more negativity, nothing will get solved and most likely there will be arguments or maybe even fights. This is one of the many lessons you can learn out of this book, go buy it today. I knew I could learn something out of it and I have learned a lot. I'm glad I bought this book+books
Good Beginners Guide on the Elements+P+The practice of the Witch relies on sources of energy for the workings.  A good witch can draw upon the elemental energies for her use and knows the properties well and how to use them best.  Ms. Sullivan's book examines closely the properties of each of the four elements and gives a good rounded education in their history, associations and applications.  The book is broken down into each element and then breaks it own further into the path of each element, the magics and then Deity associations.  There is lore, spells, recipes and herbal and stone associations.  What is nice about this book is that is does offer information on all four elements, and gives the beginning practitioner a well rounded education.  And while you may find you have a preference for one or two elements, this book will give you a good look at working with all four.  This is a nice book, easy to read and understand and provides the basics for anyone looking at the practice of witchcraft using the four elements as focus. boudic+books
There are better options+N+Unlike so many tutorial or reference books on the subject of Illustrator, this book only skims the surface of the key functions of Illustrator.  Things to be aware of: There are no companion CD tutorials - you're on your own.  This book does not give you detailed information on how to do anything. A few step-by-step examples are given on some certain methods, but mostly not. The few examples of "How to" are very high level and do not go into any detail. This book will not serve as a good reference book - information is to high level and does not include details. You will have to create your own graphics just to follow along the lessons so you can understand the concept.  On the plus side: The book now has color illustrations. The tips on the bottom of each "How To" lesson are very useful. If you have a general knowledge of Illustrator, this book can be used without the software or a PC as casual reading.  The book is broken down in seven parts: Part 1 - Prepare Your Illustrator Project Part 2 - Draw Objects Part 3 - Add Type Part 4 - Work with Drawings Part 5 - Manage Fills Part 6 - Use Layers and Styles Part 7 - From Illustrator to Print and Web  This book borders on being useless for people who are seriious about learning Illustrator. Better books that will help the novice illustrator: Illustrator CS Hands-On Training by [...] books  The Adobe Illustrator manual/book that comes with the software+books
Not for the beginner.+N+I went to the same school as the author of this book, and so it was used for my introductory CMOS design class.  The book has a lot of great material, but it was rather confusing to me as a beginner.  Now that I'm a more seasoned designer, I can look back on this book as an excellent reference, but I STILL find the explanations somewhat confusing.  It's clear that the author is a foremost expert on the subject, but he just has some trouble relaying the fundamentals to the novice designer+books
Excellent read+P+I couldn't put it down. I think it really sets the reader up with a better understanding of Iran in the 20th century, and how things have gotten so out of hand there now 26 years after the ordeal ended+books
Very, very basic.+N+I began reading this book with the hopes of picking up some fresh ideas on negotiating.  As a lawyer handling divorce and family cases, I frequently see a high-level of emotions between parties and I was curious to see if the authors had some insight into how to this might effect negotiations.  However, this book was incredibly basic, and I'm  not sure who it was written for because all it did was state the obvious.  There are better books available on negotiation and this book does not provide anything unique+books
It was perfect for our 3 and 5 year old+P+My girls loved this book so much we bought it for their cousin.  They have a sweet tooth and really identified with the book. It's very silly. We bought a used version and it was in great shape. +books
2.5 stars, tops.+N+the reviewer who states this book is a disappointment is dead on. i'm a fan of blair and eagerly awaited this book's arrival. i'm astounded at the amount of work not represented here, especially considering the price. blair was an AMAZING colorist and the poor reproductions don't do her work justice+books
The Patrol is ordered to destroy the 'Queen'+P+"Plague Ship" (1956) was one the first science fiction novels I ever checked out of our local library (I can still close my eyes and see that one dinky little shelf, crammed with some of SFs' greatest juvenile authors:  Norton; Heinlein; Del Rey; Nourse).  This book contains the second 'Solar Queen' adventure.  Norton's four-book series about the trader-crew of the 'Solar Queen' ended in 1969 with "Postmarked the Stars" but beware! Lesser authors have butted into the series, presumably with Norton's permission since this remarkable Gandalf Grand Master of Fantasy and Nebula Grand Master just recently passed away after a long and extremely fruitful career (her first novel was published in 1934, her latest fantasy in 2005).  One 'Solar Queen' rip-off to avoid at all costs is "Redline: the Stars."    Norton's 'Solar Queen' stories are told from the viewpoint of Dane Thorson, an apprentice-Cargo Master who is introduced in "Sargasso of Space," the first 'Solar Queen' novel, as a "lanky, very young man in an ill-fitting Trader's tunic."  Most of this author's heroes and heroines are young, uncertain of themselves, shy, with a tendency to trip over their own enthusiasms and load themselves up with guilt at the slightest opportunity.  They are very likeable and their adventures are narrated in remarkably lean prose with just the right touch of description.  After ten years of schooling, orphan Dane Thorson is assigned via a computer analysis of his psychological profile--not to a safe berth on a sleek Company-run starship that his classmates were vying for--but to a battered tramp of a Free Trader. To say that the 'Solar Queen' "lacked a great many refinements and luxurious fittings which the Company ships boasted" was an understatement.  But she was a tightly-run ship and what she lacked in refinement, she made up for in adventure.  Dane soon settles in under Cargo Master Van Rycke and learns "to his dismay what large gaps unfortunately existed in his training."     Sometimes I just want to give Dane a big hug.  "Plague Ship" takes the crew of the 'Solar Queen' to Sargol, where the enigmatic feline natives seem very reluctant to trade away their fabulous scented gemstones.  When Dane Thorson discovers an herb that the Salariki are willing to swap for their gems, he fears that his eagerness to make a trade breakthrough might have poisoned a native child.  That becomes the least of his worries when the 'Solar Queen' blasts off from Sargol with invisible, undetectable stowaways that would brand the free traders anathema to all inhabited worlds.  In space, the more senior members of the 'Solar Queen's' crew succumb to a strange plague that resembles sleeping sickness.  Dane and his fellow-apprentices, with the assistance of Captain Jellico's Hoobat (a sort of blue parrot-lizard, or at least that's how I've always pictured it) discover the source of the plague: venomous hitch-hikers from Sargol.  "It walked erect on two threads of legs...a bulging abdomen sheathed in the horny substance of a beetle's shell ended in a sharp point."  It was only about a foot-and-a-half high and could change color like a chameleon.  The Hoobat kills and eats the first creature, and then the hunt is on for others of its kind.  Even with the source of the sleeping sickness discovered, the 'Solar Queen's' young apprentices must still convince the rest of the galaxy that they are not a plague ship--and therefore eligible to be destroyed on sight without warning.  The 'Solar Queen' novels are prime representatives of Norton's lean action-packed brand of story-telling (at least the ones she solo-authored.)  If you haven't read them since you were a teen-ager, I urge you to try them again.  For a few pleasant hours, you will be immersed in the adventures of a likeable, feisty band of free traders on exotic, carefully-drawn alien worlds.+books
A slippery, shoddy, and dishonest book+N+This is one of the very worst books on law and legal theory I have ever read.  The authors deliberately confuse important issues, libel those with whom they disagree, and string together a series of logical fallacies in order to reach a set of conclusions they favor for other reasons.  Readers  who waste their time on this book will learn nothing of law and --  strikingly -- less than nothing of legal philosophy+books
Samson Returns...+P+In the post-communist world, the Cold War espionage genre may seem a little dated. We have other concerns and fears on our minds now. But for reasons I'll get to below, this novel series is a stand-out from that era, and still well worth reading.  This book was actually written after the fall of communism, but the plot takes place a few years before it. In this book Samson returns to work for London Central and deals with a disastrous assignment in East Germany; an internal struggle to keep positions in a down-sizing agency; etc. The book plot is interesting enough, but running alongside it are several series-length plots that continue to engross the reader: can Bernard and his wife Fiona rebuild their marriage after her apparent defection and return? In fact, can Fiona even recover from her ordeal? What about Gloria?  I just recently re-read the entire Bernard Samson series (of which this is the seventh out of nine novels). It is one of the best novel series I have ever read, and certainly one of the best espionage genre series ever. There are so many things to like about this series - the in-depth characterizations; the pithy observational asides about people and cultures; the references to multiple languages and their subtleties; the gritty European settings; the hidden plot developments and character motivations that the narrator either can't or won't see; etc.  The author claims that each of these books can be read on their own, and perhaps they could be. But you can get a lot more enjoyment out of it if you start at the beginning with _Berlin Game_ (or even better yet - start with the WWII prequel: _Winter_).+books
What a waste!+N+This author has so much talent and paints the most exquisite pictures with words but the plot of this book was so fragmented, disorganized and unfocused that it distracted from his lovely writing style. I wasn't sure if the book was about Jack the Ripper, Peter Pan, Alice in Wonderland, A Christmas Carol, losing a child, hauntings, possession, redemption or all of the above because it kept going off in different directions.  The relationships between the characters were confusing and the characters were never very well developed.  Worst of all, it just fell off at the end with no resolution.  Sometimes this works but it didn't work with this book.  Very disappointing+books
not up to standards+N+I've read all of Dianne Dorrans Saeks books and own many of them. I eagerly await each new addition so I was very dissapointed in California Interiors.It appears to be written and photographed for a European market.  It's all stuff we've seen over and over again with no cohesive theme. The  graphics aren't up to her usual standards, the book doesn't seem to have  any design. It looks as though it's a first time effort+books
Allthough interesting story, horrible recount+N+this book led me down the road of jesus' death and i thought it could have done a better job. it told too much detail about the backround of the story and i found it misleading and tiring+books
insightful, profound+P+As a male this book has enlightened me to aspects of womyns psychology, as well as my own feminine part of my psyche. She gives a personal example, a community example and how globally these psychologies effect us all. I applauded at the end! One of the best books i've read. Compulsory reading for men+books
Yawn+N+This is said to be one of Nadine Gordimer's finest works, and she is a Nobel prize winner, so I hoped for great things when I picked this one out at the bookstore, unfortunately assuming that the Nobel prize would be a guarantee that I would love it.  Well, I didn't love it.  While indeed a competent storytelling, I don't really regard this as literature.  There is not the fire, imagination or creativity one expects, nor the sophistication that should elevate such a work above its peers.  I managed to get to the end, but I can't say that I felt or learned anything at all.  It makes me wonder if there were political, rather than literary reasons that caused the Nobel comittee to honor this author.+books
Most Powerful book this side of the Bible you will ever read+P+This is the Hardback unabriged edition. Having both, let me highly recomend the unabriged. Let not the size scare you it is written in a manner so friendly as to be able to read a chapter lay it meditate pick it up 3 weeks later and read another. The chapters even the subsections can stand on their own not needing the before or after sections to be blessed with what you are then reading. I spent five years reading the book not because it is hard but because it is so clear and the sentences so full as to make you pause and say yes that is right, amen, Let me rejoice in this awhile. I would some times not be able to get back to it for weeks. Pick it up where I left off with outhaving to review the previous section to regain and uderstanding of what I was reading. Now I have to review Lois Lamore to do the same I am not that smart but This writer is that clear and plain. I recomend you skip The intro by R C Sproul(a great man) And just Begin with Gurnall writeing, You will not Be Disappointed. God Bless and He does and will Bless you as you read The Christian in Complete Armour. The most Bible filled book ever written apart from the Bible it self+books
Nice pictures, twisted story+N+This is a nearly verbatim rendition of the Grimms' story, and it's hard to understand why Zelinsky would use his talent to illustrate it for children. Even harder to figure out is how the American Library Association could award its Caldecott Medal for distinguished American picture book for children to any rendition of this dreadful tale: The king threatens to kill the miller's daughter if she can't spin gold from straw. Rumpelstiltskin saves her life by spinning gold for her, but extracts a necklace, a ring and, on the third night of spinning, a promise of her firstborn. She then marries the king, whom Zelinsky depicts as young and handsome. When it comes time for the queen to hand over her newborn, Rumpel agrees to relent if the queen can discover his name. She sends a servant to follow him into the woods and discover the name. So the king, though he looks good, is greedy and brutal. The queen is a victim who agrees to give over a future infant to save her own life, and then depends on an anonymous, unrecognized "servant girl" to save the child. And Rumpelstiltskin, shown as physically unattractive and (the message seems to be) therefore bad, is the one who saved the future queen from execution and then relents on the payment he bargained for. A weird, twisted story that offers nothing for kids, illustrated with Renaissance-style pictures that accentuate the perversity by making the bad guy look good and the guy who saved the damsel in distress look bad+books
Magnificently engrossing novel, finest kind+P+Entirely involving, entertaining and nuanced (that's the new adjective, right?) novel about Hollywood (woo-hoo) during the HUAC witchhunt. Some might call this book a soap-opera but, would that be so bad? Most everything the revered Faulkner wrote is not only soap opera but, gasp, Southern Gothic Soap Opera. LOVED this book which brings back to public consciousness a black period for the U.S. and for democracy and discusses it with a grey palette. Wonderful, exquisite, consuming reading. Well written, with very knowing eye and irony; it's a DO-NOT-MISS-BOOK!+books
Incomprehensible+N+I tried to find specific conditions in the book - and the procedures to follow for treating them.  I couldn't even figure out the procedures to follow when reading them - the writing just isn't very clear.  If there is any organization to this book, I couldn't detect it.  The author is very enthusiastic about the material and gives lots of her experiences with her patients.  That's nice, but judicious editing, better organization and clarity is what this book needs. +books
Post-apocalyptic religion+P+Dick wrote this in collaboration with another sf great, Roger Zelazny, though the end result is not really one of either author's best efforts. In a post-World-War-III wasteland a religion has grown up around the God of Wrath, whose human embodiment is one Carleton Lufteufel, the government official who detonated the doomsday device that contaminated the Earth's atmosphere with radioactivity. Limbless painter Tibor McMaster sets off in his cart on a quest to find Lufteufel to capture the god's true visage in a painting. There's some interesting speculation around the encounter between a vitiated Christianity with this life-negating religion (Deus Irae means "God of wrath") and a somewhat Zen-like spiritual renewal may be found in the novel's conclusion. The religious preoccupation gives the novel interest as a kind of reflection of Dick's other greater novels of the late 60s and 70s, despite the somewhat casual and fragmented history of its composition+books
design essential+P+I return to this book over and over as a reference for the design of play environments+books
Lifeless, dull and boring+N+I couldn't get past the first few tales.  They left me feeling.... nothing.  Reading the back of a cereal box would have been more exciting.  I would definately not recommend this book.  As a fan of Earlene Fowler and Monica Ferris.  I thought I might enjoy &quot;the cat who&quot; series but if this book is any indication of the author's writing, I'll pass+books
Apocalypse, fairy tale, farce -- what is this thing?  +P+Is it a sci-fi tale about the end of the world, black comedy, novel of inner pilgrimage, or a southern small-town novel like To Kill a Mockingbird?  All of these, and none, quite.  You can catch snippetts of the plot and setting from other reviewers.  But trying to squeeze this weird, topsy-turvy, yet familiar world into a few words is like trying to put the bubble bath back in the bottle.  Ideas and images float up in flurries.     Or maybe we should define Love in the Ruins by its characters?  Each is as brilliantly drawn as a blade of grass in the first bright rays of morning.  Not all are mad, in the conventional sense, though Thomas More, the drunken, philandering, brilliant, pious hero, who somewhat resembles the author, sometimes is.  "Dear God, let me out of here, back to the nuthouse where I can stay sane.  Things are too naked out here.  People look and talk and smile and are nice and the abyss yawns.  The niceness is terrifying."  Percy also offers three lovely leading ladies, a tribe of black revolutionaries, "love" scientists, "Knotheads," a "scoffing Irish behaviorist, in whom irony is so piled up on irony, jokes so encrusted on jokes, winks and nudges and in-jokes so convoluted" that he has turned orthodox, and a pretty spooky Satan in flannel.       Maybe the best way to introduce this book, aside from saying that it often made me laugh outloud, and often made me think, is to quote a few more lines.  If you like the taste, want to sup more on the strangeness of life (the quality by which reality so often surpasses mere novels), you'll probably want to read the book.     (1) "Max the unbeliever, a lapsed Jew, believes in the orderliness of creation, acts on it with energy and charity.  I, the believer, having swallowed the whole Thing, God Jews Christ Church, find the world a mad-house and a madhouse home.  Max the atheist sees things like Saint Thomas Aquinas, ranged, orderly, connected up."  (2)  "Ethel's car is both Japanese and Presbyterian, thrifty, tidy, efficient, chaste."  (3) "The terror comes from piteousness, from good gone wrong and not knowing it, from Southern sweetness and cruelty . . . In Louisianna people still stop and help strangers.  Better to live in New York where life is simple, every man's your enemy, and you walk with your eyes straight ahead.+books
The Real Lives of Children?+P+Controversial, yet remarkable look at how young children, primarily boys, resisted and re-made the conditions of their existence in early 20th century U.S. cities. His chronicle of the newsboys' strike is vital  history. The book is more controversial when discussing the actions of the  so-called 'child-savers,' one of whom actually included social activist  photographer Lewis Hine. He dismisses the action of these advocates as  puritanical and fundamentally ignorant of the real conditions of the  children's lives. He decides that children are neither powerless nor  defenseless, and this decision is, of course, a double-edged sword when  dealing with the very real abuses of child labor and child exploitation  that still pervade the U.S. and the globe+books
Determinedly bleak+N+I started this novel after reading Erdrich's Love Medicine. While it is clearly not as lyrically written, it is more accessible, and I admired Erdrich's inventiveness as she creates a very unique set of characters. I never finished "Beet Queen", quitting not that far from the end. When Celestine's child turned out to be so impossible, it was the last straw. "Beet Queen" is just too determinedly bleak, to no higher purpose I could discern or discover in reading reviews here.+books
good basic book, but lots of errors and typos+N+It's a good basic overview, but the errors in the code snips are just too frustrating. I bought it because it was recently published (2006). But trying to get PEAR to work (DB.php has been superseded by MDB2.php) and even the simple form were exercises in futility.    If you do use it get an AMP package (google: Uniform Server) and skip the install section. You'd think O'Reilly could include and AMP stack on a CD in the book and use that 20 pages for another exercis+books
One of My Favorite Carole Matthews+P+I found this to be one of the best Carole Matthews titles that I have read. Carole's books always present such interesting challenges faced by her protagonists when it comes to life and love, and this one is no exception.   Set in a small village on the outskirts of suburban England, Carole does an excellent job in capturing what life is like in a small town, with neighbors watching your every move, speculating and spreading rumors that sometimes only have a sliver of truth to them. She even reveals how wrong people can be about what is innocent, and what isn't in a small town through hilarious antics of a housewife turned prostitute.  The main character, Rose, is trying very hard to start a new life in a small town, but nobody wants to give her a break because they don't understand what she does as an aromatherapist, and mistakenly think she is a prostitute! As she settles in, she begins to fall in love with a local, who is going through his own relationship troubles. However, she is still torn by the affair that sent her fleeing from London. I couldn't stop reading as Rose tries so desperately to make the right decision, faltering for some time but eventually coming to terms with her feelings after a rather muddy encounter!  A definite must for any fan of Carole Matthews, or British chic lit+books
disappointing+N+I had totally different expectations of what this book would be like.   I thought it would be mini biographies of strong independant women.  Instead, I found it very much a victim minded book.  The author seemed to go off on tangents often about the men in these women's lives instead of concentrating on the women themselves.   +books
A Solid Sequel+P+While not as breathtaking as Kurkov's orginal "Death and the Penguin", this sequel was still highly amusing and captivating.  After Viktor abandons his pet penguin to save himself at the end of the last novel, "Penguin Lost" picks up with Viktor trying to make ammends for his earlier actions.  A great book, but you should read "Death and the Penguin" first, if you want to follow the plot+books
Everybody is Beautiful+P+Each character is perfect. The women are so loving and the men so caring that they pair up nicely in four sweltering short stories. They live in a fantasy world full of friendship, kindness, and romance. Life is wonderful; no major worries except whether they like and love each other but those never last long. Everybody earns some sort of good income. Everything comes to a faultless ending. Each story involves hot chocolate suitable to the title of the collection. It is a great read before going to bed+books
Athena and Kain: The True Meaning of Greek Myth+P+The preface to ATHENA and KAIN states that the content of the book is revolutionary, and it really is. I looked up revolutionary, and in the context used it means, &quot;a total or radical change, as a revolution of thought.&quot; There is no other book on Greek art or myth like ATHENA and KAIN. Mr. Johnson points out that Greek sculptures appeared on public temples and other public buildings, and that mythological scenes appeared on the ancient Greeks' everyday pottery and storage jars. The average Greeks understood the meaning of their myths. Because of ATHENA and KAIN, it is now possible for us to understand them, too+books
Only a rightwing lunatic would hate this book+P+The truth is our society feeds into the so-called need for guns for everything. It is no wonder we're actually losing the real war on terrorism and further undermining national security. The people who hate this book seem to find it ok to read and listen to gun toting rightwing propaganda all the time. Yes, my state is a gun toting state but that doesn't mean that none of these people want a little safety once in a while. Gun control and gun violence are two different issues altogether despite the NRA's and the rightwing attempts to lump them together. Read this book and remember this quote from Atticus Finch of "To Kill a Mockingbird":  "Courage is when you know you're licked before you begin, but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what. .. Courage is not a man with a gun in his hand. Real courage is when you fight for what is right regardless of whether you win or lose.+books
What else is new?+N+Jill Nelson is just another angry, bitter, whiny black woman with an axe to grind.  This book is filled with the same old whining and cliches which have grown really old and tired.  Almost everything she touches on is so predictable whether it's accusing black men who date outside the race as being sellouts (while saying nothing of black women who do the same thing of course), demonizing the Million Man March, whining about the light skin/dark skin thing and basically ranting about how the black woman is a pathetic victim.

The horror of Airport book purchases...+N+I was given this book by a friend with great taste in books, so I eagerly started it.  After the first few chapters, I could not wait for it to end. The ultimate horror of this book is reserved for those compelled to finish any book they start.  As has been mentioned in other reviews. WE GET IT. The woods are "SCARY" and their presence is pervasive. The characters themselves, despite the author's intent, are also wooden, and if the reader experiences any fear, it is the fear of being infected by the banality and possible mental retardation of Heather Price and her insufferable family.   The best way to describe the story for me is this: It's a fairy tale. Its simplistic writing style and unsophisticated fear-factor could have very easily been told in 5 or 6 pages, and inserted invisibly into a volume of Grimm's. As such, it would have been a much better tale with at least the healthy moral about the hazards in spending too much time with your crazy Aunt.  As a novel, it is pure water torture. If the trees ever do revolt, useless wastes of paper such as this piece will most certainly be causative.  I asked my friend about it after I finished. He admitted it was a joke... a book he bought on a flight out to visit me, and in his words "I was praying my plane would crash after the first 2 chapters."  Indeed+books
not worth it+N+I was expecting a well composed novel and ended up with a story instead. Have you ever been stuck on the telephone with a friend who insisted on reporting a personal story in a rambled manner while you have better things to do with your time? Or better yet, just get completely bored with the whole thing and hang up as quickly as possible? That's what I felt like while reading this novel. The composition of this novel was, at best, junior high level. And, to top it off, I live in the San Francisco Bay Area and was unable to conjure up any interest in her ongoing blah blah blah about what street she was walking or driving through. I think I'm going to take BART to the city and abandon the book somewhere in Chinatown+books
Read the KJV please.+N+This bible is not the true GOD'S Word. It has been changed too much. I believe that the KJV is the true Bible. God died for our sins. He shed his blood so that we might have everlasting life - but, ONLY if we belive. This bible is written to make you feel good about yourself. All we are sinners destined for hell and damnation. God was not brought into this world just to make us feel good about ourselves but to make us feel a need to repent from our sin. We cannot get to heaven in eternity unless we believe in the LORD JESUS CHRIST+books
Uncovering the realism of mountaineering...+P+A real look into the world of mountaineering that hasn't been glamorized or overly dramatized (in the case of other authors).  The primary focus is Denali, but the book often shifts attention away from it, giving the reader a good look into the mountaineering career of Jon Waterman and a bit of insight upon many others.  For the experienced mountaineer, they can most likely relate to many of Jon's experiences.  To the less experienced, it will give a sobering wakeup call to the realities of mountaineering.  I must disagree with the reader from NY listed below as stating that &quot;The author falls into the trap of thinking that climbing is going to give him and some other fellow climbers an insight into life beyond that of the ordinary man.&quot;  For anyone who has survived a truly epic climb, one does gain a bit of insight into life that they failed to notice beforehand, and that many others do not completely understand...do this regularly enough, and it can in fact change a person.  The book was NOT self-indulgent in the least...merely giving a first hand account of his experiences, both good and bad.  If you are planning a trip to Denali, this should be required reading...+books

Formidable research.  Deeply flawed conclusions.+N+I genuinely wanted to like this book.  However, the arguments put forward are so deeply biased by Goldhagen's strong views on the subject as to be worth little in granting the reader greater understanding of the Holocaust.  It doesn't read like a history book and I wasn't surprised to learn (afterword) that the author is not a historian.  That said, there is value in reading it.  The book is rich in facts and detail, the result of some indepth research.  However, the way the author uses (and abuses) these facts left me wanting to stop reading in frustration.  The book is filled with 'Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc' arguments and mental gymnastics designed to prove Goldhagen's hypothesis.  Millions of non-Jewish victims are for the most part ignored in this work, but it still can be worth a read.  But, only if you are not put off by reptitive, awkward prose and are prepared to seperate the rich collection of data from the author's emotionally driven interpretations+books
I have to give it credit, but it left ALOT!+N+I read this book, aafter I had seen the movie several times and I must say, Elizabeth Levy left out alot of the Romance and other things. But she did put a different view on things. I would give it 2 1/2 stars, but I  can't+books
Well written, elegiac, but slow, and ultimately boring+N+Yes, Jordan writes well, uses words and descriptions beautifully. One of the many glowing blurbs on the dust jacket described it as "elegiac" and it certainly is, but elegiac only takes a book so far.  Beyond that, you need interesting characters that the reader cares about, set in a story that moves with a compelling narrative.  Perfect example, ATONEMENT.  Sadly, SHADE joins the pile of books I put down after wading through more than 100 pages. I could not finish it even though I was trapped on a long airplane flight with nothing else to read+books
Great Book!+P+This book is very good for the beginner.  But no Unix book can teach everything.  That's why I found it better to also buy the Unix Essentials DVD.  It's way better when you have both.  And it only costs $5,325.99.  You need these DVDs. You really do!  Hee hee! Just kidding. But I really am sick of all those fake reviews that advertise these over-priced DVDs+books
Icy and exquisite+P+This is a slim, lush novel set on Fire Island in the 1960's, and written years before the plague of AIDS. Its subject is the intoxicating, intimidating, seductive, and ultimately cruelly destructive hip gay demimonde: the ruling class there -- and its &quot;subjects.&quot; Gifted and kind-hearted novelist-critic-memoirist-teacher Edmund White's first novel, and the one that got him noticed, then praised by Nabokov and many others. It describes a lost world, but has much to say about the one remaining. Beautifully constructed and definitely worth reading+books
What's Beneath Your Syntactic Interface?+P+Maggie Balistreri's critique of our masked, substantively evasive dialect offers humorous, albeit troubling, insight into how much of the social fabric, the prevailing belief structures and cultural processes, are entrenched in mass denial, subsisting on and predicated upon the avoidance of truth and meaning within common, everday conversations and exchanges. Think of it as speaking in riddles. Unfortunately, it's done considerable damage in shaping the broader public discourse.    This particular deficiency is widely adhered to on an unconscious level, to the extent that it's accepted as 'normal'. Let's suppose that the majority of a population shared a common mental illness, a soul sickness; isn't it possible, even likely, that over time, a greater percentage of them would be unable to acknowledge the disease ...*as a disease?*  And by that postulation, wouldn't the afflicted then in turn deem those not likewise effected by it as the ones who are sick, weird, bad, wrong, etc?   With people generally unaware of this process(and likely uninterested in it)they are incapable of acknowledging how cognition and grammer are fused in a manner indicative of a deficient, or at least insufficient, mode of consciousness and expression which is congrous to self deception, mass deception, and in turn, self and societal censorship.    This elaborate process largely stems from the "Just Do It" corporatized mentality. The underlying, strategic message of "Just Do It" is DON'T THINK. That is, don't think beyond the superficialities of life: of a mindless, wage slave existence relegated to the various conformities of rampant consumerism, and all it entails to define human worth and "success" on such terms.  When people don't think beyond those terms, when the customary, daily round of life is beset with a deluge of incentives and inducements toward desensitization and immediate gratification rooted in the manipulation and exploitation of innate human insecurities, often through induced signals and social cues concerning inadequacy, fear, anxiety, the result is an unthinking, non critical, homogeneous conformity among the populace where the surrender or denial of critical thought, genuine expression and emotional respression is widely encouraged, enabling an overall acceptance and exaltation of a unique spiritual and intellectual paralysis.  Logically it follows that since most are environmentally impacted and absorbed into this deficiency, its symptoms and manifestations are largely viewed as the opposite of what they really are, allowing for a delusional, happy consciousness. Language reflects this.  My take on what Maggie is addressing in her book isn't a random social trend, and that there isn't necessarily a direct correlation with this dilemma and a person's overall intelligence or vocabulary; it's an inevitable byproduct of poisonous, corporatized values.  The proof is how corporate power, which is basically the hierarchy of government, so obviously benefits in every way from the crisis of social and spiritual declivity.  The greater the degree of ignorance, apathy, and general disharmony, the greater profits to be made from human misery, and the more draconian measures that can be implemented by exploiting the symptoms which then serves to frighten people into being less independent minded and more stupified, perpetuating the cycle.  The psychological dynamics of these cycles are fairly simple to figure out provided people are encouraged to do so. If they're not sufficiently roused into paying attention to matters of great public import(something that the media should do but of course does just the opposite)than naturally, the people's language and efforts of communication are going to reflect a particularly narrow mindset.

Synonym/antonym: Socialism and Democracy+P+We are so conditioned to the fix put on the left by the Leninist tradition that we forget the crucial role of the left in the 'forging of democracy' as recounted in this history in a 'slow but steady' account that accumulates telling detail. Once there were liberals who weren't democrats and then the left, in the wake of the failures of 1848, proceeded to the course corrections we now take for granted, no thanks to the liberals who weren't democrats, now democrats, by name at least, denouncing socialism by a Leninist standard where the term was a demand for real democracy. +books

Excellent Factual Overview Of The Religion Of Ancient Israel+P+This is one book on ancient Israel that actually delivers what its title promises. In &quot;The Early History of God&quot; Mark Smith systematically sifts through archaelogical and literary data from Bronze and Iron Age Palestine, the Mediterranean, and Mesopotamia to find the earliest evidence for YHWH, his cult, and his context. Chapters include discussions of YHWH and El, YHWH and Baal, Asherah and asherahs, cultic practices, such as communication with the dead and child sacrifice, at the sites where YHWH was worshiped, as well as a brief discussion of the beginnings of monotheism during the late monarchy. Refreshingly for me, Smith frames his argument on available evidence, not on wishful thinking, and the result is provocative and stimulating. The long introduction to this new edition covers the debate that has gone on since the book was originally published over ten years ago, and the extensive footnotes are a wealth of information on every side of the discussion. This is the kind of book that helps keep scholarship in good repute. Don't wait to read it+books
Steven Travers writes with a unique insight+P+With the multitude of books written regarding the sport of baseball, Steven Travers writes with a unique insight into not only the sport, but the day to day lives of Bonds and his peers.  As a former professional baseball player, Travers touches on the subject matter with a unique insight and perspective.  Additionally, Travers attended and graduated from USC during the time Bonds played at Arizona State (Pac-10).  As such, Travers is not only a writer, but a fan.  Travers not only documents Bond's achievement of becoming baseball's all-time single season homerun champion, but he touches on Bond's trials and tribulations with his peers and the media.  Ultimately, the reader soon realizes that Travers was able to do what many has tried and failed at; that is, he was able to garner the respect and support of Bonds in the ability to tell his amazing story to the whole world.  As a former Pac-10 pitcher at USC who battled Bonds on many occasions, I found Traver's insight very refreshing and commendable.  I found the book a very easy read that kept me entertained throughout.    '     +books
What I've Been Waiting For!!!+P+I saw the group of eight in concert about a month ago and I was so disappointed to see the performance end.  I REALLY enjoyed their poetry and this book just gave me another dose of it.  Sometimes you need another dose to fully get into poets, because when Beau Sia came to Northern Michigan University, I didn't care for him.  I didn't think he was funny. But when I saw him in Chicago, I cracked up.  Poets are funny people.  Sometimes they just take some getting used to and some grow on you before they can open their mouth (i.e. Lemon).  I'm curious why the ninth poet wasn't on the tour, but atleast I got to read his poetry in this book, which was excellent from beginning to end. My favorite poem is &quot;Love Poem&quot; by Lemon, but the rest are all good in separate styles.  All the different techniques and language are what make this group so entertaining. Keep up the great work!  I was advertising for them coming to Chicago like I would get commission for it and I'm going to do the book the same way+books
A Giant among Giants+P+Some books are optional.  "The Worm Ouroboros", by E. R. Eddison, is not.  It is more than just the birth of high fantasy writing as we know it.  It is a tale that connects with imagination and wonder in a way that books today simply don't do.  When you read "The Worm Ouroboros" you'll realize that modern writers produce stories, but they don't tell Stories.  Since the English language fails to provide me with adequate superlatives for this review, I'll just have to present samples of Eddison's writing:  "But a great wonder of this chamber, and a marvel to behold, was how the capital of every one of the four-and-twenty pillars was hewn from a single precious stone, carved by the hand of some sculptor of long ago into the living form of a monster: here was a harpy with a screaming mouth, so wonderously cut in ochre-tinted jade it was a marvel to hear no scream from her: here in wine-yellow topaz a flying fire-drake: there a cockatrice made of a single ruby: there a star sapphire the colour of moonlight, cut for a cyclops, so that the rays of the star trembled from his single eye: leviathans, all hewn from faultless gems, thrice the bulk of a big man's body, velvet-dark sapphires, crystolite, beryl, amethyst, and the yellow zircon that is like transparent gold." (7)  Everyone can write description, but only Eddison could write description like this.  He makes the colors shine brighter and the shapes of the "monsters" stick out in your mind.  And even though you may not know what a crystolite looks like, you agree that it fits perfectly into this paragraph.  Eddison realized that you can't a world that mirrors the heroic past if you get stuck in the decidedly un-heroic language of modern times.  "Now had they for three days or four a devious journey through the foot-hills, and thereafter made their dwelling for forty days' space in the Zia valley, above the gorges.  Here the valley widens to a flat-floored amphitheatre, and lean limestone crags tower heavenward on every side.  High in the south , couched above great gray moraines, the Zia glacier, wrinkle-backed like some dragon survived out of the elder chaos, thrusts his snout into the valley.  Here out of his caves of ice the young river thunders, casting up a spray where rainbows hover in bright weather.  The air blows sharp from the glacier, and alpine flowers and shrubs feed on the sunlight." (153)  Perhaps it's because I'm a mountain-climber myself, but I found Juss and Brandoch Daha's assault on Koshtra Pivrarcha to be the most memorable chapter in a book built out of unforgettable chapters.  In real life no two mountain ranges are alike, yet most fantasy authors write only staid standard-issue descriptions when they make mountains.  Eddison understood that for us to see the glaciers, feel the biting cold winds, and experience the exhilaration of reaching the summit with the heroes, he needs to give his mountains some real personality.  These samples, of course, only scratch the surface of Eddison's brilliant mix of visceral detail and towering metaphor; he maintains this level, never flagging, for all two hundred thousand words.  But of course "The Worm Ouroboros" could hardly have claimed such a lofty space in the pantheon of imaginative fiction without a plot and character worthy of this lavish writing.  On one side King Gorice XII of Witchland sends his warriors out to crush all opposition and subjugate the entire world to his will.  Opposing him are the adventure-loving lords of Demonland, lead by the magnificent Lord Juss and his family.  The ensuing conflict will rage on land and sea, across continents and mountain ranges.  And without any doubt Eddison crafts his dialogue with the same mastery he displays in his narration:   "La Fireez," said Juss, "we weigh not so lightly our obligation unto thee.  Yet must I hold my course; having sworn a strong oath that I would turn aside neither to the right nor to the left until I had delivered my dear brother goldry out of bondage.  So sware I or ever went that ill journey to Carce and was closed in prison fast and by thee delivered.  Nor shall blame of friends nor wrongful misprison nor any power that is shake me in this determination.  But when that is done, no rest remaineth unto us till we win back for thee thy rightful realm of Pixyland, and many good things besides to be a token of our love." Said the Prince, "Thou doest right.  If thou didst other thou'dst have my blame." "And mine thereto," said Gaslark.  "Do not I grieve, think'st thou, to see the Princess Armelline, my sweet young cousin, grow every day more wan o' the cheek and pale?  And all for sorrow and teen for her own true love, the Lord Goldry Bluszco.  And she so carefully brought up by her mother as nothing was too dear or hard to be bought to pass for her desire, thinking that a creature so noble and perfect could not be trained up too delicately.  I deem to-day better than to-morrow, and to-morrow better than his morrow, to set sail for wide-fronted Impland." (315)  One of the most commonly used review terms is larger than life.  "The Worm Ouroboros" is larger than larger than life.  Indeed, after finishing you may wonder whether it would be more appropriate to refer to real life as "smaller than Eddison"+books
wicked good guide+P+I fell in love with this guide after unhappily perusing the Lonely Planet, Time Out, Let's Go, and other assorted guides to the city. I'm in the proces of moving to Boston, so I didn't want chapters and chapters about hostels and tourist meccas and Boston history (for that, I'll buy a real book). Mainly, I wanted something I could use to get myself around the city and figure out the neighborhoods (looking for an apartment from a few thousand miles away isn't that easy, let me tell you, espcially when you have no idea where all the places are, and the local bookstore wasn't stocking any 'Moving to Boston' books). So this little black guidebook, hiding out behind Frommer's guide to New England, was a blessing.    The main difference -- and advantage -- this guide has over the others is that it is map-based rather than text-based. Each section of the city has about three maps in the book, one showing essentials (banks, hostpitals, landmarks, libraries, schools, and of course, donuts), one showing Sundries/Entertainment (bars, coffee, copy shops, gyms, liquor stores, movie theatres, restaurants, and shopping), and a final covering transportation (subway, bus lines(!), car rental, and parking); of course, all the streets are labeled as well.     This alone would have made me buy the guide, but behind these maps, the guide discusses the parks, convention centers, ballparks -- and provides floorplans for them if you ever want to buy tickets for events. It has listings for universities and colleges, it explains the commuter rail, Amtrak, how to get to the stations. It has a full page of 24-hour services!! (Something I've found severely lacking in other guides) It lists libraries, hospitals, police stations, Boston movies, books, songs, art galleries, it has floor plans of theatres!! Three pages of bookstores! A full street index (like in the best city maps, London A to Z), a fold-out highway/driving map of downtown... gasp. This is possibly the most perfect guide to Boston I could think of, the guide I would have written and designed if I were a guidebook writer.    And one of the best, coolest things is that there is a little elastic band on the back cover so you can hold the thing closed (and, by extension, put stuff in the book and then keep it there so it's not falling out, like in a Moleskin notebook, if you know what I mean. Very useful for notes and reservation sheets and tickets).    The book itself is extremely compact, probably 5 by 7 inches (?), which means that the type is very small (I'd estimate about 7pt?), so that might be the one thing some people might have a problem with. Myself, I am a big fan of the size (of the guide and the font) because then there's just that much more you can fit into a small space+books
Ideal para chicos y grandes!!+P+Esta fabúla es fácil de leer para pequeños y grandes, y con una de las mejores enseñanzas.

El pricipito se convertirá en una persona real, que te llevará a conocer gente y lugares, pero sobre todo te enseñará una de las más importantes lecciones en la vida. Esta lectura la recomiendo a esas personas como yo que les gusta soñar y aprender. Es todo un auto-examen de personalidad. Que lo disfrute+books
Save your money+N+I must first say that the only reason that I've given this book one star is because that's the lowest amount that I could give it and Bach's Lute Suites are in the book and the book didn't fall apart. This book gives you no real performance notes, no true historical perspective of the music and how it should be interpreted, and the fingerings are adequate at best. As a teacher,and performer I can only recommend this book if the Frank Koonce Bach book is out of print or you can't afford something else. Shame on you Ariel Publ. and Jerry Willard+books

Escape, travesty and a waste of money!+N+This novel is a travesty and should never have been published.  I am so sorry that any of my money went to a company, Coronet, that would render such a great author's work into a chopped up mess.  Read Whirlwind, it is great and essentially you will get two books for one if you believe that Escape is one unto itself ( I obviously don't).  I was expecting further elaboration upon the story line of Azadeh and Erikki but it is just each section that pertains to them chopped out of Whirlwind and put into a separate novel, butchers! +books
How Much Coffee Did Feigenbaum Drink?+N+I was going to wait until I finished reading this book to review it - seeing as how I still have 100 pages to go - but I'm not sure if I'll be able to ever finish it.  The book spends A LOT of time telling you the back story about how certain achievements were made in the field of science, but when it finally comes time to report the results of those achievements, the reader is only partially satisfied.  Very little actual science, and a lot of biographical information.  I was hoping it would be the other way around.  If you're interested in reading biographies of scientists you've probably never heard of, this is definitely the book for you.  Why would I give a book I didn't finish 2 stars?  Because I did pick up a few interesting mathematical tidbits from the sections I read.  I just didn't pick up enough tidbits to keep me going.  The universal constant is interesting, and the cross section of the chaotic 3-D graph is interesting too.  Great for scientific history buffs, but those looking for application for personal use, forget it+books
A great read for primates of all types+P+I only discovered Edgar Rice Burroughs by accident a couple of years ago when I picked up a copy of this book "just because".  It turned out to be far better and far cooler than any expectations I might've had.  If you think you know Tarzan and haven't read this, I've got news for you.  YOU DON'T KNOW TARZAN.  He's a hundred times more savage and a thousand times more interesting than all those movie versions of the character.  He's also surprisingly complex and sympathetic even as he slaughters nearly everything that crosses his path.  I'm amazed this book was written nearly a hundred years ago.  It's so graphic and unapologetic for Tarzan's bestial nature.  That said, there are a few small flaws.  Elements of the plot can be a bit contrived, but since it usually serves to get to more action, I can forgive that.  Burroughs's writing, while still engaging, is a little stilted by today's standards.  And it doesn't end with Tarzan getting Jane.  That's the story of "The Return of Tarzan".  Not ending in a book ALWAYS bugs me.  I hate cliffhangers.  I don't need to be blackmailed to read the next one.  You can read this book and enjoy it without reading the others.  Still, even the great Edgar Rice Burroughs loses a star for this flaw because I REALLY HATE CLIFFHANGERS.  Sorry, Eddie.  Do yourself a favor and pick this up.  It might ruin you for other so-called adventure stories, but it's worth it+books
Lousy image resolution makes this product unusable+N+Although this electronic atlas has all the Netter plates, and quite a few nice new ones, as well as some radiographic views, it is nearly unusable in practice. The images are scanned at such low resolution that many important details are simply not visible. The program can only display images at 640 x 480 x 256 colors, regardless of your monitor or video card (it even says so right in the documentation). Part of the horizontal resolution is used up by the navigation bar, so the actual plate image resolution is even lower than 640. If you estimate a typical plate to be 10&quot; x 10&quot;, that works out to maybe 50 dpi. Many of the smaller features on the original art cannot be seen on tne electronic version, and often it is impossible to tell where the leader lines are going. The quality does not change when you print or zoom in. All the other bells and whistles, like the study lists, searching, etc. just do not make up for the fact that the image quality is absolutely awful. And the user interface is terribly archaic, nonstandard, and hard to use. The font for the lables is horrible. Also, I'm not sure I like the pronunciation of the speaking feature: &quot;pec-tor-AY-lis major&quot;? If you have the cash to spare, it makes a nice toy, but it is not worth the price+books
A hacked version of the classic anthology+N+As a huge fan of the author and the original release of this brilliant short story collection, I am extremely disappointed in the new release. HUNT DOWN THE ORIGINAL. The new version omits all of Zelazny's forewords and, more damning, it actually omits some of the better stories found in the original collection. Silverburg mentions &quot;Horsemen!&quot; in the introduction, then the story is strangely absent. This is a travesty+books
George, (...)+N+George has always been my favorite Beatle.  I have been celebrating his birthday and got the Concert for george Harrison and watched it on his deathdate, and even wrote my 6th grade biography on him.  So, I turned to this book.  There were plenty of grammatical errors and false information.  I think that it said in the front that he didn't "hassle any of the beatles for this information" then how could he even get information such as this.  Go to I, Me, Mine it's a better book because its WRITTEN BY HARRISON HIMSELF! +books

Thousand Pieces of Gold+P+The film (one of my favorites) inspired me to acquire the book and as usual I found the book to be far superior to the film. The norm since converting a book to film is similiar to condensing.   The book did lack in factual detail which would have made it longer and far more interesting, as a factual historical novel. As a piece on racial discrimination and women's fight for equality it is the best of reading.  For those interested in the subject the book and film are well worth adding to your collection.    +books
Something Entirely Different+P+This collection of short stories was given to me by a good friend. With one or two exceptions, it concerns women confronting decisions - from the most mundane to the fairly serious. What sets these stories apart, in addition to the fine writing style, are the decisions made by these women. They are never politically correct or predictable. At times the reader may find the direction taken by the author to be controversial, even uncomfortable. I know I asked myself during several stories, "Now why the heck would she do that?" I suspect that was the point being made by the author and what is the ultimate joy of the book - to force the reader to accept each character as independent of any predispositions by the reader.  The author uses sarcasm and more conventional humor where the average reader is least likely to expect it. She takes simple stories and sends them in unexpected directions. My favorite story in the collection was "I Thought You Said You Love Me", perhaps because it was the most conventional. That said, "Model Job" was just as enjoyable, but most unconventional.  Treat yourself to something different and read "Inside Out." The author is preparing to publish a volume of poetry, which should be a treat indeed!+books
Get Asad it is by far a better text+N+The only reason Pickthall is still popular is due to its mass circulation in  nations such as India, Pakistan, Indonesia and parts of Africa. Firstly he uses archaic language which does not make it easy for individuals to understand the themes and meaning of the Quran in a coherent fashion.  People "claim" that he is very much true to the Arabic of the Quran; that his is a very literal translation but lost in context. Well that is the point how can it be a "literal" translation when it is infact out of context in most places.  There is also an issue of a history with this translation, it has been edited more times than most other translations and not by the original translator (Pickthall) but other individuals.  Most Quranic translations have this humble claim that they are doing their best and they ask for forgiveness if there is indeed any error. That is the problem, most readers who rely on the English (first hand) may not even know if there are errors.  Not only is this translation subjective, nor has it been supported by historical explanations of the Quran and lastly most people consider it to be out of context where the translation is NOT substantiated for with explanatory material or evidence of why the translater chose to render certain controversial passages as he; (or now in the case of so many revisions, as "they") did. +books
Good book+P+How to Think Like Leonardo da Vinci was a book I was required to read for a class and honestly was not thrilled about, but I ended up loving it!  If you have any interest in da Vinci, this is a good book to read, and even if you don't, it will make you think more about what kind of thinker you are. +books
Good only for 007 fans.+N+You will find the Ornithologist James Bond's old employer, Philadelphia's Academy of Natural Sciences does not sell copies of this book.  They will sell you Herbert Raffaele's updated version of this book instead.  Why?  Because, it is at least from the 1930.  it contains information which is seriously dated.  Not to mention that the pictures are mostly in black and white with only about 10 colour plates.  The pictures that are contained in the volume are not very representative of the birds you will encounter.  This book is acceptable if you intend on bird watching on your caribbean holiday, but we spent much of our time guessing if we were really looking at a bird.  Yes, you can take a book of Eastern US birds with you, but do you want to take a birdwatching library with you on your holiday?  Not to mention there are birds which will not show up in a US Bird book (e.g., bananaquit and parrots).  You will notice that the most effusive reviews of this book come from fans of Ian Fleming's 007, not bird watchers.  That is because this book is much more a piece of 007 trivia than useful to modern bird watchers.  The story of How Ian Fleming's agent was named was that Fleming was at Goldeneye, his Jamaican house, and needed a name for the protagonist of his spy novel.  Fleming wanted a plain name and his eye came upon his copy of James Bond's "Birds of the West Indies", which Fleming described as his bible.  Fleming thought that James Bond would be the perfect name for his spy (No, Audobon would not have been a possibility).  Mr. Fleming paid the ornithologist a dollar a year for the privilege of using  the name James Bond in his novels.  Serious bird watchers are better served buying Herbert Raffaele's updated version of this book or James Kavanagh's "Caribbean Birds".  You could also be sentimental and want this because it was what you used when you were young during the period that this version of "Birds of the West Indies" was the only show in town.  In case you haven't guessed, I am both a bird watcher and James Bond fan who owns two copies of this book.  Consider this review with that in mind+books
A Violent Book About Anti-Violence...+N+While this book has good intentions, I found it to be the most violent book about anti-violence that I could imagine.  The text is not so bad, but the illustrations gave me chills.  I thought it couldn't get any worse (guns, knives, etc.), when I came to a page where a little boy was lying in a pool of blood hugging a teddy bear.  In my opinion, this is not the kind of book that should be viewed by any child, let alone a child who needs a book about anti-violence+books
God's Bits of Wood+P+A lyrical and beautifully written narrative of the struggle between the local railroad workers' union and their French overseers during a strike against the Dakar-Niger Railroad. Set in 1947 this novel describes a timeless environment which has gone unchanged in post-colonial West Africa. Given the hightened awareness of the plight of Africans today this novel gives a great insight into the history and background of their deprivation and poverty+books
This book sucked hard+N+If you read this book -- you can thank the author for making you dumber. If you spent money on this book -- you can thank the author for wasting your hard-earned cash. If you enjoyed this book in any respect -- then you can thank the author for her talent in writing fiction.  Not only was this book chock full of crap, it didn't at all confer with the people involved to get the facts straight.  This is all hearsay and press coverage that anyone could dig up googling the subject matter. Now, if you believe what the press tells you -- then you're a real sucker+books
I am glad I am not the only one who thought this was horrible.+N+Absolutely one of the worst books of all time.  It took at minimum sixty pages to realize the heifer was missing and then it was downhill from there.  I had such high hopes for this book, but it is not worth your time, so don't bother.  I was mentally ticking off all bayous convenient to NOLA so at least half of the characters could be dumped.    I will give the author another chance, but if her main character is as snotty in the rest of the books, forget it.  That goes for the rest of the characters.    +books
Four-year-olds and I find this book delightful.+P+The first time that I read this book was with a group of four-year-olds.  They enjoyed it so much that they immediately asked to have it read again.  The story and pictures draw one into an imaginative world.  The little girl  in the story is looking for her stuffed dog, Sally, who is lost in the  quilt.  The squares of the quilt become a wonderful landscape with the  little girl calling, &quot;Sally!&quot; trying to find her dog. The second  time through the story the four-year-olds were calling, &quot;Sally,&quot;  along with me as I read.  Delightful+books
Complete And Utter Garbage+N+Nancy helps Mr. Drew with his case concerning a rare bird farm that is scheduled to be torn down to make way for a high-rise apartment building.  The owners of the farm are being frightened with jinx signs and other symbols of bad luck.  Ooooooh!  That's so scary.  Yawwwwwwn.  This book is absolutely horrible.  The writing is terrible, the action is missing and there really isn't any mystery.  It's not like Nancy is trying to find something or even capture a gang of unknown criminals.  When you start the book you know that the people building the high-rise are the bad people.  Lots of suspense there.  This book features Nancy at her worst as she stoops so low as to use little children to get what she wants.  This is an awful book that doesn't even deserve a 1 star rating+books
What a disappointment+N+I expected so much better. The first two novels in this trilogy were very entertaining and managed to weave both dramatatic historical events with classic family tensions, particulary with the Cheney sisters. Each character including the tertiary characters were well defined.  In this one, the other Cheney sisters never even show up and unfortunately it is a glaring omission.  Predictable and boring from beginning to end.  Sadly, much like the heroine+books
Important Topics, No Substance+N+I approached this book with the utmost hopefulness since there has not been one to date on Asian American youth. Unfortunately, now that I am no longer in my teens I have a difficult time relating to their borderline cliche reflections. For sure the anthology could have done without the &quot;Now I'm in this Ivy League college&quot; biographies and most of the poetry, about which I wonder if the authors won't be a bit embarrassed later on. This was a much-needed effort, but just because there is urgency does not warrant slack editing+books
Good Basic Guide to Cruising+P+I bought the book to begin CLIA training.  This book is very basic, but covers many different aspects of the cruise industry.  If you are beginning to work in cruise sales, or are just interested in cruising, I would definitely recommend it.+books
awesome read+P+A look inside the real world of modeling and it's past and present stars.  TONS of information about the history of modeling in here.  It drags on a little bit at times but is otherwise very interesting and entertaining.  I'd def recommend it to anyone in the biz or interested in becoming a part of it. :+books
Findind Faith+P+Brian does a great job of thoughtfully and logically addressing basic questions that people face then trying to navigate the maze of "spirituality"in our culture.  Like the C. S. Lewis classic "Mere Christianity" which is quoted often in the book it does not attempt supply all of the answers the "life the universe and everything" but offers thought provoking logical arguments for meaningful faith in a real God.  His conversational style is easy to read and the arguments are compelling.  I highly recommend it no matter where you may be on your spiritual journey+books
Belaborment+N+Since many of the positives of this book were mentioned by other reviewers, I'd like to point out a few of the book's undesirable qualities.  First off, belaboring the point.  When I read a cookbook, each recipe doesn't specify to sift the flour.  That information is usually provided at the beginning and by inference is applied to all subsequent recipes.  When I read time and time again that Ed isn't using bottled oxygen, it starts to drive me nuts.  Yea I get it. You're the man.  You don't use supplemental oxygen unless you're a guide, so don't keep reminding me.  Maybe this style of writing was to make the record absolutely clear, I don't know.  For myself, I would appreciate an author more if they had faith in the readers to remember one generality placed in the beginning of the book.   Secondly, was this book edited?  On page 278 Ed says "I've always believed that you need to listen to the mountain and watch for the signs it's giving you."  Then on page 282, on the same ascent of Annapurna, he says "I've always believed that the mountain tells you whether to go up, stay put, or go down."  He just said this!  Even an amateur copy editor would see this and recommend removal.  Maybe this really isn't a 2nd criticism just a corollary of the first.  The negatives aside, the substory concerning the French hiker Jean-Christophe Lafaille was excellent.  And learning of Ed's early days in Washington racing up Rainier was pretty cool.  Ed's candor concerning other hiker partners is somewhat interesting, if almost risque.  I am thankful to Mountain Hardwear for providing this book for free......I would recommend taking it out on loan from the library because its definitely not work taking up space in a book shelf (there's little 2nd read potential here)+books
For designers, directors and academics+P+This book, one of the few that takes a more academic, rather than practical, view of scenic design, should be required reading for any designer (lights and costumes as well as set) as well as every director. In his designer profiles Aronson shows the reader the different processes that can be utilized to achieve a successful design.  It is also one of the few books that gives the reader an opportunity to get deeper into the history of contemporary American design, as each designer is sure to mention his or her influences and teachers.  Far more useful then the practical books on design in helping a young designer conceptualize, collaborate and create interesting designs.  Unless you want to design in a vacuum, this book is a must rea+books
Great women's history+P+Not only the legal status but the personal outlooks of women changed immeasurably in the period this book covers; the subtitle speaks of space and power, but Deutsch has also given us a fine overview of intellectual change: what women thought, and why they thought in those ways, during an era of astonishing industrial and social development. Through her research, we can see why the women of Henry James were not the same as those of F. Scott Fitzgerald--and they were very different.  We are used to sympathizing with the plight of working class women, and giving great credit to the founders of the settlement houses and political groups that helped them, but until now I had never realized how class differences affected attitudes, and how perfectly reasonable women of either set found great difficulty in understanding how those of the other thought and felt. This book has helped me get a better understanding of both groups.    In recent months I've been reading heavily in Boston history and in women's history of this period. This book is far and away the best thing I've found. Having done historical research using primary sources, I can tell you this author has done an immense amount of work, and it has paid off. She uses not only the minutes of meetings and legal reports, but personal letters and contemporary novels to tell the story. She writes clearly, and the book is well organized. If you want a real feel for the lives of women during a period of tremendous change, this book is the best place I know to get it. Deutsch straightens out a lot of misconceptions, and helps to clarify an extremely complex period.  +books
Knitting has always been an important social responsibility+P+This book is a wonderful examination of the social history of knitting.  Knitting for family has always been a requirement of any woman.  But, this book revels how woman across America knitted items in support of the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, WWI and WWI.  In fact, there is currently a program to knit scarves in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.  Knitting for charity is also discussed.  When our governments can not, or will not, provide for the needy; American's women have+books
outdated+N+Positioning makes a few basic points that are helpful for someone who is not familiar with marketing basics.  However, the examples are so outdated that some now disprove the authors' arguments.  The more detailed chapters make less sense in an electronic culture.  This book is really only useful now for those broad, basic ideas in the first chapters+books
A mediocre book at best.+N+I can't compare Learn To Program with C to any other C books, because this is the only one I have read so far.  All in all, unfortunately, the book has turned out to be a failure.  I simply didn't get out of the book what I wanted: an elementary introduction to the language.  At times, it seemed the author was using phrases that he had never used before, as if he had explained them before at some point.  Bizarre, yes.  He made the assumption that some of his terminology was either very simple to pick up on, or was already covered.  It wasn't simple or already covered.  Also, perhaps equally bothersome, the author talks too much about the students in his fictitous class.  Make note that there actually no classroom with the students he is always talking about.  What is probably most bothersome is that he often repeats the same things over such as "I waited to see if anyone else had a question."  He is the one writing the book, of course he knows if one of his characters is going to ask a question or not!  Remarkable.  The interaction between him and his students may upset some people just because there are no actual students.  As far as the book being easy to read, well, the introduction is, but you may get lost after that.  I did.  It is possible that C is to blame, or may be it is how the author presents the language+books
Very Interestingly Confusing+P+This book (the cover amazon has displayed is *wrong*) is very interesting.  It is also exceedingly strange.  It was never boring, but it never made too much sense either.  You think there might be supernatural elements involved -- but maybe not.  It's a tale of the coming to America from England, the stuff that happens to the British here, and Indians.  Cool, confusing, book+books
Great supplementary reading.+P+The most redeeming quality of this title is its readability. Talbott is able to convey all the drama and excitment of life in international politics.  That said, this certainly isn't a title which will help you get a complete understanding of India, Pakistan and nuclear weapons. I read this book to supplement required reading for a course on War in South Asia and it greatly helped in terms of reinforcing key events and players.   I reccomend this to those who already have a reasonable understanding of the situation in South Asia and want a bit of light reading and would like to see the soap opera aspect of the affair.+books
Lacks clarity+N+The author talks about all major developments in the field of Quantum Physics as of the date the book was published, but does not explain them clearly, especially towards the end with topics such as super gravity. The diagrams appear out of sync with the text, and are not explained well. I somewhat liked the book in the begining, but at the end was forcing myself to finish it+books
F.I.+P+Even as a child, and as an African, I have always been interested in the TRUE HISTORY of my continent not told by the so called conqueror, which has always shown people who rebel in a disgustingly bad and unture light. Especially the american majority, who somehow get amnesia regarding the how and why this STOLEN LAND got its so called democracy. Once again, this book is very detailed and tells how and why really the ENTIRE CONTINENT OF AFRICA, was inflicted with dirty politics (GOLDS,DIAMONDS, MINERAL WEALTH, ETC.),for the ill gotten gaines and total disregard of the indgenous people by europe and the united HATES of america.ESPECIALLY THOSE OF COLOUR+books
Highly Recommended!+P+Written for Business Executives, this book will help you understand the dynamics between corporate identity and value creation in business.  Lawrence D. Ackerman believes that the true strength of an organization is reflected in its identity, and its ability to use its identity to drive the creation of products and services that provide value to customers.  Ackerman posits that there should be a cycle between the identity of the company and the profit it generates.  The wealth produced by the identity of the organization should feed back into the identity that creates it.  The author has outlined a set of guidelines to identify value for the organization.  Ackerman calls them the Laws of Identity.  For example:   1. The Law of Being:  "Any organization composed of one or more human beings is alive in its own right, exhibiting distinct physical, mental and emotional capacities that derive from, but do not transcend, the individuals who make up that organization."   2. The Law of Individuality:  "An organization's human capacities invariably fuse into a discernible identity that makes that organization unique."   3. The Law of Constancy:  "Identity is fixed, transcending time and place, while its manifestations are constantly changing."+books
Not worth the $ and frustration+N+I returned to college to further my education this year after working as a High School Chemistry and Biology teacher for the last 5 years, and your text "Fundamentals of Analytical Chemistry (with CD-ROM and InfoTrac) 8th Edition" is the required text that we are using for my Quantitative Analysis course.  Myself and numerous other students in the class have found ourselves completely exasperated with the text for numerous reasons.  Some of the reasons are as follows:  1. Formulas written incorrectly, while the definition/derivation is written properly right next to it, or vice versa. 2. Incorrect answers to the end of the chapter questions given in the back of the book. 3. The end of the chapter questions will often have no previous examples shown in the chapter, or in the chapters prior to it. Essentially there is no guide or basis to begin a question. 4. Asking for something in a way that is so convoluted that one has no idea what is being asked. 5. Suddenly using or asking for a term that has never been used in the book. Such as asking for "molar solubility"...nothing in text as to referred, nothing in the index, and nothing in the glossary. 6. Your solved examples within the chapter are atrocious, in that they are of virtually no use when trying to use them as a guide to the end of the chapter questions. And thank you for skipping/not showing steps or assuming things in the problems when they are shown.  These are great given that one comes to consider the questions, Did I make an algebraic error in solving? Was the formula given the correct one, and was it even given correctly? Did I do it correctly, and is it just the wrong answer given in the back of the text?  I have taken into consideration that I have been out of school for a while and that I may not be as sharp as I used to as far as some of the more complicated calculations, because I have not had much practice recently, however, when one is trying to learn from a book that makes it so hard to do anything with it, it makes it about as useful as a paperweight, which is about the best use I have for it now. A $100+ paperweight.   I thought that the mistakes were due to an early edition text, but with a simple view of the front of this book one can readily see that this is the 8th edition...the EIGHTH edition! One would think that after writing the same book 8 times, these errors and some general refinements may have taken place; thank you for the exception to the rule.   In all my years of school, I have come across many books, both used to learn from as well as ones to teach from, and I have never found a more poorly done text.   We, the students and professor, have created a website solely dedicated to the errors or oddities that we have so far found in the text: Needless to say, it continues to grow.   I will say that it is nice to see you incorporating Excel and other software into the text, which is beneficial in its use in Industry and presentation.  Thought you might want to know...thanks.+books
Beautiful story of determination........+P+I enjoy reading many different genres, but historical fiction is one of my favorites......and lately, the cultures of India, Sudan, and any of the countries in that exotic section of this wonderful world seems to satisfy my reading addiction.  THE TWENTIETH WIFE is a rich, exotic view of the women, their desires, and females' position in society in the Mughal Empire of 1600's India.  I could "feel" India as I read the story of Menhurrisa. This girl knew what she wanted at the early age of 8 and kept her focus on the love for a man she first saw in a parade. Almost all woman in that era would consider love for a man like this unattainable..........royalty above her class.   This was a book that I couldn't get enough of. I looked forward to the next page at all times. I enjoy reading a book that takes me mentally to another time and place. By reading this book, I learned a lot about the ancient 17th century Indian cultures of women and harem life, which had a class system of its own that the women had to deal with.  I highly recommend reading this book if you like historical fiction or if you enjoy reading a story of a strong woman who believes in herself and beats all odds to attain her desires.   I read this book about 2 1/2 years ago and the story has stayed in my memory. I bought the sequel, THE FEAST OF ROSES, last year and plan on reading it as soon as I finish the historical fiction novel that I am now reading set in 1500 England.  If you are looking for an awesome book, and very good historical fiction with surprising twists and turns spiced with a whole lot of action......this is a book you will truly devour.   I highly recommend this read.  B Harris +books
How To Write:  Annie's Way!+P+In this book Annie talks about what she does to write.  Each author has their own idiosyncratic and philosophical ways and means about how they write.  Annie shares with us some of both of her own.  She prefers a place without distraction.  A room with `no view' is preferable.  She does not even have too many basic heating or air conditioning requirements.  She will get by.  She finds a room over a garage or a pine shed without out any windows just perfect.  No distractions.  Philosophically she talks about the value of the reader knowing the lengths to which the author goes to create what they do.  She questions the relevance of that information.  And throughout, she discusses the position the author has; the removed and yet constrained perspective that the writer possesses in creating the work they are writing.  Finally, she talks about the author having the power to discuss extremes.  Conceptually, the idea of "Absolutes" being the focus of all non-fiction writing is mentioned.  The author's ability to set the tone, the mood and the results are discussed, but with the caveat that the story sometimes leads the author, and not the other way around.+books

Red Hat Linux Bible+N+I bought this book with great anticipation, however as I started the install it went to frustration. I know nothing of Linux when I started this, and it became a disapointment. The information in the book generaly does not line up with the Linux I installed from the CD that came with it. Also the comands that he talkes about wer not present when I tried them. allot of the setup comands you have to install manualy, I had to do allot of trial and error. His book is also badly organized I find, I found my self fliping to differant sections of the book for the same item. Some of the instructions for setup at the install are in the middle of the book. This may be a good book for when you know what you are doing, but I dont recomend it for the beginner+books
A Big Ego Proves to Be Both an Essential Asset and Worst Enemy.+P+"Pit Bull" is the trading memoir of Martin "Buzzy" Schwartz, multimillionaire stock and futures trader who won the "Champion Trader" title  in the 1984 U.S. Trading Championship, the "Most Money Made" title in 1983, and conquered the futures division in 1992. He made a lot of money too, but Mr. Schwartz loves the limelight and a good competition. The book starts in 1979, when Schwartz abandoned his 9-year career as a securities analyst to trade his own money on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, and progresses through his tumultuous, exciting trading career until the mid-1990s.   Schwartz sometimes digresses to relate incidents of his childhood and youth, illustrating that he was always a gambler by nature, so "Pit Bull" has some qualities of an autobiography. Schwartz' story is peppered with trading advice, and many of its best moments are when he describes his experiences during specific market events, such as his losses when the market surged after the 1980 presidential election, the idiosyncrasies of trading on the Merc, and October 1987's Black Monday and its aftermath. Martin Schwartz has a big personality and a frank sense of humor that keep the reader entertained. It seems he was both a success and a failure, having succeeded in making himself quite wealthy but not always wealthy enough for his tastes. But he gives the impression that he enjoys trading immensely most of the time.  "Pit Bull" concludes with "The Pit Bull's Guide to Successful Trading" in 30 pages, for those seeking insight into Martin Schwartz' success on the markets. It's a pretty handy guide in which Schwartz lists the trading tools and market analysis services that he uses, outlines his techniques for using moving averages and some chart patterns, and summarizes how he plays stocks and futures. That's followed by a description of "My Typical Day". "Pit Bull" is fun, I instructional, and easy to read.  I was surprised that Mr. Schwartz sometimes tries to anticipate -or bet against- the market instead of following it. But sometimes he got burned. No surprise there+books
Very stupid book+N+I purchased this book thinking that it would have good ways to make my boring room look a bit interesting, but I, as a thirteen-year-old, wasn't impressed with the ideas in the book. Condratitory to what the author says, the projects were NOT fun, NOT cheap, NOT for a teen audience, NOT interesting, and NOT a good addition to your room whatsoever. The four themes in this book, which include flowers, teddy bears, funky, and nature, all look as if they were made for the ten-and-under age group. I mean, seriously, what teen devotes their whole room to TEDDY BEARS and decorate every inch with the strange projects in this book? The ideas for the projects are unoriginal, strange, and lame. For example, some of the ideas suggests that you splatter your bedroom wall with multi-colored paints, make a scrunchie holder out of a recycled soda bottle, put a headboard behind your bed that says "I Love Teddy Bears," and so on. Yeah, I know, it's stupid and immature. So if you want a GOOD book that will give you some GOOD room decorating project ideas, definitely stay clear of this one!+books
In a Word, "Generic"+N+This is the first book I've not been able to put down - not because it was so riveting, but because I couldn't wait to be done with it. It reads like a grocery list of domestic issues that might be intriguing for an adolescent or, perhaps, for someone who has never left their small town and dreams of the dramas that they assume lie in the big city. The themes, problems and experiences of the Stassos family are so completely generic that, should the book be interpreted into any visual form, it would take the shape of the most heavy-handed after-school special ever made!  And as for the "poetic" prose that is attributed to this novel: the use of language is over-the-top and often pretencious. Many experiences are not simply stated, but are rather coated with words that only add weight rather than description or meaning.   One example that I underlined: "'I'm always careful,' Ben said, in exactly the spirit he would toss a too-small offering -- a hibiscus blossom, a pomegranate -- into a crater." WHAT?!!!  Granted, the context is missing, but even in the context, this quote made me laugh. And by the time i came to the last third of book, the laughter was all that got me though to the end (that, and the fact that I had to finish it because I told someone that I would.)  If I could give this book less than one star, I would. +books
Redundant and uninteresting+N+I obtained this book with the hope that it would build on the themes I encountered in another book I'm reading (Destructive Trends in Mental Health).  As a practicing experimental psychologist, I have observed first hand the strengths and weaknesses of the field of psychology.  Unfortunately, McIntyre failed to deliver.    First, the book is short on ideas and repeats them often.  Having biases is bad (he scapegoats religious and political ideologies).  Social scientists aren't brave enough (the author seems to idolize Galileo and Darwin).  Social scientists whine too much (about how *hard* their science is - my whining is in the next paragraph).  Social scientists need to look at the data instead of relying on armchair theorizing.  People don't really want to understand human behavior.  Yep, I think that's about it.  Now, repeat this in as many ways as possible and you can stretch it into a very short book.    The author turns a good word and thus the book is an easy read (thus the two stars).  As much as I might agree with some of his points, he overstates them (he caricatures social scientists as ignorant ideologues uninterested in data) and misses many important ones regarding the challenges of the field.  If I had as much control over humans as physicists and chemists have over their subject matter, things would be a lot easier.  So-called "hard" scientists don't have to ask the subjects of their inquiry if they want to participate in their experiments.  They also have much greater control of extraneous variables (Can I *please* be allowed to raise humans in the lab??? Can I *please* be allowed to run experiments on societies, governments, races, companies, ...  by changing their laws, rules, structures, income, etc. to my hearts content?).    The book would have been much less repetitious if he would have seriously considered the other challenges facing the social sciences instead of assuming that they're all easily surmountable.  Hint: Think weather prediction and you'll better understand the challenges of the social sciences.  The author needs to check his own biases at the door - it's obvious that he's a liberal atheist (as he was free to admit).    In sum - read the second paragraph of my review and you've gotten the gist of the author's message.  Skip the book. +books
Don't judge a book by its cover+N+I bought this book for my Pre-K class, to go along with our weather unit on Rain. The cover looked so nice I thought it would be a great book. In fact, the illustrations are quite nice; the problem is there's really no story here. The language doesn't flow; its very choppy. The children didn't enjoy this book, and have not asked for it to be read again. Good children's literature should have a story to it: a setting, problem and solution; a definite beginning, middle and ending; and well-defined characters. This book has none of that+books
Passing Gas: And Others Towns on the American Highway+P+This was really interesting and not hard to read.  Enjoyed the information and laughs+books
An engaging, literate swashbuckler fantasy+P+This is one of my two or three favorite Poul Anderson books and one of my top 20 favorite novels, period.  It's a combination alternate history-swashbuckler-magical fantasy set in the era of the war between Cavaliers and Roundheads, but with a difference: they have railroads already.  Well plotted, well paced, inventive, suspenseful, great descriptions.  Not too deep, though--just great fun.  Characters: Traditional but not stereotypical hero, heroine, sidekick, villain, a few historical figures, some familiar literary non-humans and a guest cameo appearance by a character from one of my other favorite stories of his.  This story makes one really appreciate how well grounded in  history and literature Anderson is.  He also displays that all-too-rare ability to use the English language of the past with complete accuracy, a skill the lack of which can easily break the spell of an effort which might have otherwise succeeded.

Good book+P+I love the Alice books even though sometimes they shock me with their content to be honest. I have read about 6 of these books and I go out of order because I can't always find the ones I'm looking for. I read "Including Alice" before this and thought it wasn't that great; this one was much better. There is comedy, irony, heart break and some happy moments too. Alice and her friends are very much like a lot of teens that I have come in contact with.   I was pretty sad about her break up with Patrick although I knew they were broken up already. I really think they are each other's first loves but I doubt they will end up together in the end. Most teen romances just don't work out.+books
Brilliant Thud memoire+P+The F-105 is a most fascinating aircraft. A superb cold-war design; it was meant to be a sort of man-guided supersonic cruise missile for delivery of nuclear weapons to tactical targets in the european theater. It was, of course, never used for this purpose, but was instead put to a use in the air war over Vietnam. The Thud was never meant to be a precision dive bomber, or to pass through heavily defended areas at subsonic speeds. All the same, politicians dictated this use (and of course went looking for someone besides themselves to blame when their "top fighter-bomber" started getting shot down in heroic quantity; so many were shot down, there weren't enough seasoned men to continue to fly them. They were shot down in so many myriads, fresh out of pilot school fighter-bomber jocks, or long grounded middle-aged desk jockies would be put directly into combat (where they would often be shot down).  The men who flew this jet were, as the cliche goes, a special breed of heroes. Unlike, say, fighter pilots or B-52 pilots, they faced almost certain death, or horrible imprisonment. Their survival rate was comparable to that of the B-17 tailgunner over Germany in WW-2; very low indeed. Oftentimes their missions were secret in nature, so the government couldn't even acknowledge that the Thud had been shot down and work for the release of the pilot.  Major Rasimus' memoire takes place at a crucial escalation in the war; in 1966. The Johnson administration decided to escalate the war by "sending messages" to the North Vietnamese via the use of bombing as a psychological and diplomatic tool. The hare-brained scheme was that, by bombing one thing, and not another, the NVA would be trained, like a pet dog is trained with a rolled up newspaper. The idea was ridiculous, and of course didn't work.   Rasimus was one of those unsung heroes who, fresh out of pilot school, grew enormous handlebar moustaches to protect them from evil on their impossible missions. He tells the tales of the base dog, Roscoe, and of various of his team, and those who came after. You can practically smell the oil on the tarmac, and the blackpowder charges which combat-started the '105's engines. While americans would rather forget the war in Vietnam, I can't forget the courage of these men who fought in these insane supersonic contraptions. May their spirit inspire a new generation of warriors. Thanks Ed; for your service and your great book+books
A New Classic for Years to Come+P+"Don't Play In the Sun" by Marita Golden ***5 Stars  This is a very disturbing subject, especially if you are lightskinned like me.  Luckily, Marita Golden handles it with a lot of tenderness and care for others.  I liked Marita Golden's book more than The Color Complex, because her life story gave it a specially intimate dimension.  I would recommend this along with anything by Kola Boof, an Ethiopian author who has really been bringing this subject up in ways that literally stop the blood in your veins.  Her novel "Flesh and the Devil" breaks this issue down but it's not for the squeamish.  She's like Hardcore compared to Marita Golden and most authors I've read.  I'm going to read "The Bluest Eye" next.  "Don't Play In the Sun" is a NEW CLASSIC.  People will be reading this for years.   +books

close, but not quite+N+I was looking for a book that had legends about orphans to which I might relate.  This book only has 4 or 5 stories and I had already heard them in some form.  I also thought there might be some therapeutic or life management benefit in listening to this book.  However, the author merely lists the "gifts" (personality tendencies) and describes the emotions of abandoned children, but does little by way of giving ideas for healing oneself or dealing with the ongoing relationships between our relatives and others.  The content and gentle delivery might be helpful to those still grieving or those still trying to put their feelings into words; but, it does little for listeners at the next level seeking solutions or strategies+books

Simply THE best Mark Twain biography+P+Mr. Powers leaves every other Mark Twain biographer in the dust.  This work is not only beautifully detailed and researched; it is a constantly engaging 'page turner.'  Beyond all that Mr. Power's own gift as a writer is extraordinary...his words literally leap from the page.  One of the best reads I have had in a long time+books
A Wimp of a Hero and a Predictable Villain+N+Karen Rose became an auto-buy for me after I read her latest, You Can't Hide, then bought I'm Watching You. Those two are the most enjoyable romantic suspense books I've read in a long time. Rose made me enjoy a serial killer story - something that had become passe for me over the last few years.   I can't give Have You Seen Her the same accolades. First, Steven Thatcher is a wimp, his whining and hanging on to his baggage made him the most unattractive man I've come across in a romance. That he was the hero truly made this book lose a few stars. Special Agent, Neil, deserved the girl, not Thatcher, and Jenna should have stuck to her conclusion that Thatcher would always be suspicious of any man who so much as spoke to her. I just couldn't see how Jenna could have her HEA with a man like that. Each time Steven went into his childish knee-jerk reaction, I was willing Jenna to forget the guy and look at Neil instead.  I was also disappointed over how dumb the police were not to guess who the real killer was. All I can say is that I'm so glad I didn't read this book first when I decided to try Karen Rose. It would have put me off completely and I'd have missed the not-to-be-missed books of the two Reagan brothers+books
Average+N+I really enjoy Travis Hunter's writing and would go so far as to say that he's one of my favorite writers, so I went back to his older books to see how he started. I'm glad I started backwards because had I read this book first, I wouldn't have continued. It's not a bad book.  Two friends, one a [...], the other one trying to make a difference in the black community, two brothers: the [...] from earlier and a crackhead, a sister who's disgusted with her own race and another sister with her head in the church.  The book was so incredibly cliche.  I wouldn't say it was a bad book, I've just read it a thousand times before and then turned on the t.v. to watch reruns of it+books
Is this really Italy?+N+I don't know if I was more disappointed or angered at this little insignificant but dangerous book.  The contents has very little to do with what children, who travel to Italy, will ever encounter.  What I find it does is continue the negative strereotyping of the Italians.  Really! No one stomps on grapes and a child who will visit a farm in Italy will hardly see such outdated stereotypical occurrences.  Can food be the only thing one would like of Italy? Of course, since the book failed to explain what other things of wonder a child might see.  I bought this for my grandchildren, as sadly there are very few book on Italy with some italian words.  I returned the book because I would NEVER introduce Italy to my grandchildren this way.  A very expensive book that perpatuates outdated images.  Poor job. +books
Bring Open Inventor Like functionality to a Browser+P+I believe VRML 2.0 is the perfect extension for students who have studied OpenGL and OpenInventor. The &quot;VRML 2.0 Source Book&quot; brings into the light many concepts in Open Inventor which seem difficult to apply.   Interpolators, sensors, collision detection, ...etc.   I applied many of the examples, into OpenInventor file format, rendered the scene graph, and control the scene with an open inventor widget.   Likewise, I was able to recreate the same functionality using a browser.  Understand VRML 2.0 is the next level of computer graphics, and the &quot;VRML 2.0&quot; source book provides the mentorship necessary to get there+books

Gripping story+P+I found this book at my local used book store.  I was a little hesitant to buy it because I was afraid it would your typical teenage agnst story.  But for only four dollars, what was there to lose?  I was in for a surprise and a real treat!  This book not only captures the teenage insecurities that most of us have felt, or are feeling, but it also captures that nervous, excited, almost panicked feeling a lot of us get after graduating high school, and moving on into the &quot;real&quot; world.  The book was unique in many many ways.  The first third of the book was the main character describing a history of her life by describing pictures she had found, and giving a short story for each one.  The second section, told from her point of view, gave the reader insight into her high school life, dealing with peer pressure, school, and dating.  In the third part of the book,  she begins college, and also begins to spiral out of control, and the books tone shows this.  This section is told in third person, as if she is going through so much, that she feels she is watching herself from the outside. I was very impressed with the writing style and the story line.  I would recommend this book to anyone+books
If your not catholic don't buy this book+N+Before I got married I really excited to incorporate Irish customs and traditions. I was so happy when I received this book, until I started reading it. Don't get me wrong it is a very interesting book. But although my husband and I are of Irish decent, being what would be concidered protestant christians I was unable to incorporate any of the blessings or ideas for readings, since they were all meant for a Catholic wedding. If you want history buy the book. If you're Catholic buy the book. For the rest of us. . .save your money for your honeymoon+books
A tale replete with rich detail+P+Pros:  Development of setting, characters, and interweaving stories.  Cons:  Some might find the degree of detail too heavy and slowing.  I usually start by describing some of the plot, but the story-lines are only about a third of this book's considerable charm. So . . .   The Setting: This is an alternate history tale, as far as the setting goes. It takes place on Earth, and more preciously in (what is left of) England. But, this Earth had no Ice Age, it was struck by an object (popularly believed to have been a meteor) that caused the Sundering (the seas rose, the land was mostly submerged, cultures lost touch with one another, the climate changed drastically), and humans live side-by-side with mastodons, mammoths, glyptodonts, and other creatures that did not perish (because there was no Ice Age). The result is an isolated England, that retains much of its past, but has culturally evolved away from what it is (to us).   The Characters: I am not sure that I have ever read another book that is populated by this many quirky, interesting, amusing, well-developed characters. These are very realistic people, living in a surreal time. Even their names are colorful, quirky, and interesting: Dr. Pinches, Mrs. Matchless, Mr. Threadneedle, Tim Christmas. The characters and the writing speak strongly of a Dickensian influence, but is definitely also just plain Jeffrey Barlough's.   The Plots: Yes, I did say "Plots" in the plural. There are three, distinct story-lines, that share some characters and the same setting and time period.   The woes of Ms. Jane Wastefield is what I would entitle one story-line, wherein a beautiful young woman receives a birthday present that terrifies her father to death and then haunts her every waking moment. How can she be rid of the fiendish thing?! Who can help her? Everyone wants to, but no one seems to know how. Will she succumb? Would defeat be as terrible as she fears? And what about her pet monkey?   The wizarding notions would be a good title for the story-line about Mr. Threadneedle, his apprentice Tim Christmas, and whatever they are tinkering with out in the coach-house. Can they make it work? Will everyone be shocked? Will anyone believe them, without seeing the finished product? Will Mr. Threadneedle find some peace and enjoyment, if he succeeds?   The secret of the will is what bothers another set of characters. When rich old Joseph Cargo died, he left most of his estate to his favorite nephew, but who is Jerry Squailes, and why does he get one-fourth of the money? No one knows, and young Frederick Cargo, spurred on by his shrewish wife and aided by their elderly, honest attorney, Mr. Liffey, go on a mission to uncover the truth. Will they like the truth, when and if they find it? Will that thing kill any of them before they do solve the mystery of Jerry Squailes, the unknown heir?   My Take: This book is some of the best escapist reading I have ever found. The world described is so different (but not) and so replete with interesting characters, that it becomes a great place to retreat to. The writing is very detailed, with tremendous development of setting, characters, and the interweaving stories. It is truly a fascinating journey to take, and the ending(s) is not how Hollywood or fairy tales would do it, with a panoply of happily-ever-after. However, it is also not depressing. This tale is just plain well done.  The Bottom Line This is a very memorable experience that takes you to a different place and tells you an interesting tale about amusing characters.  Recommended:  Yes+books
An Amazing Read+P+This book is great from start to finish.  Siegel holds the readers attention from beginning to end.  The book opens in a courtroom where a former boxer is accused of "assualt with a deadly chicken."  This had me laughing out loud.  Siegel is a great writer+books

More New Historicism+N+If one is interested in the latest nonsense from the academy, this time dressed up in New Historicist colors, buy this book.

THE book that changed my attitude about tough times.+P+Robert Schuller's book &quot;TOUGH TIMES NEVER LAST BUT TOUGH PEOPLE DO&quot; gave me the insight to understand life and the knowledge that everyone goes through tough times at some point in their lives.  The  challange is how we deal with those times and how each one of us can take  these difficult situations and turn them around into something miraculous.   When you think you just can't take one more step and you read this book you  will know that you can  and as Dr. Schuller says, &quot;inch by inch  anything's a cinch!&quot;  If YOU are going through very tough times I  strongly suggest you read this book so that you too can become a  &quot;possibility thinker&quot; and turn YOUR &quot;scars into stars&quot;+books
If forced to choose between this book & a visit to the gynecologist -- head for the stirrups.+N+Here's the thing -- I wanted to learn the story of Isolde and that is why I picked up this book in the first place.  I have read one other Miles book (I, Elizabeth) and that wasn't very impressive but I thought I'd give Isolde a try.  It was painful!  Miles chronically uses flamboyant and overstated language which just feels silly.  Her characters are very poorly developed.  Also, the author has a strange habit of often not setting up scenes which is resultingly jolting -- leaves the reader thinking, 'Wait!  Where the heck did that come from?'  After reading this book, I couldn't decide if I was more annoyed with the author for writing like this or with her editors for publishing such weak, unskilled writing. +books
The book for those who want to know about Tradition &amp; Health+P+Not only is the inside of the book as fascinating as the beautiful cover, but the text keeps the reader from putting the book down.

One of the great contemporary American novels+P+This book is perhaps my favorite American novel of all time.  Kesey's brand of storytelling is highly engaging and makes this book readable in one sitting.  However, he is most admirable for his characters.  The protaganist of "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" is Randle Patrick McMurphy, a brash and determined young delinquent with a devil-may-care attitude.  McMurphy feigns a mental disorder in order to be moved from prison to a mental ward.  Upon entering the mental institution, McMurphy stirs up all kinds of trouble by befriending and influencing a bevy of mental patients, all with their own interesting eccentricities.  All of this is done to the dismay of the dictatorial "Big Nurse" who becomes McMurphy's nemesis.  Interestingly, the story is told through the character Chief Broom who for years has pretended that he is a deaf mute, an aspect that affords him greater perceptability.  I highly recommend this book--it will humor, sadden, move, and excite anyone who reads it.  I have also concluded that--in my limited experience with literature--Randle Patrick McMurphy is the greatest character ever conceived by an American novelist+books

My willing suspension of belief became unwilling+N+I liked this novel at the beginning.  The cast of characters was good.  As comic relief I thought Hannah Goldsmith was great -- and, speaking euphemistically, the tension about progress, or lack thereof, in her love life was of considerable interest.    What killed the story for me was the coincidences: too many, too unlikely, too intrusive.  We are supposed to believe that Chief Inspector Detective Wexford has a very similar situation in his home to the murders he is investigating.  We have about every character and suspect in the novel being related to each other in one way or another.  By about page 250 of a 320 page novel I had had enough. The author had blown her believability.        Ruth Rendell is, of course, one of the best known of English detective novelists and has many loyal fans.  Perhaps she's written better books. I hope so.  But don't choose this one to read unless you are really, really a fan.      Smallchief   +books
Triathlons for Beginners+N+Sally Edwards is an impressive athlete, that's why I bought her book.  I was looking for tips from a former Ironwoman.  What I got was a book geared toward women who are just beginning a fitness program, not serious athletes who are training for triathlons.  This book is chock-full of really bad advice ("If you don't have a HRM, put down this book and go buy the best one you can afford") and completely inadequate training schedules (for endurance training, she recommends 45 minutes to 1.75 hours of training per WEEK!), this book was a major disapointment.  Edwards should have given her book a more realistic title and marketed it to the weight-loss crowd, not serious female athletes looking for good advice.  Joe Friel's "Triathlete's Training Bible" is a MUCH better choice for serious athletes.  If you want to look better in a bathing suit and have impressive stories for your friends at work, this book is fine+books
Stay Clear of Lonely Planet+N+A hopeless mess of headlines and confusing comments, very little structure.  No rankings of what you should see and do, no pictures, no useful restaurant and hotel recommendations.  Endless yatter about nothing makes this a boring read with almost no real content.  Absolutely worthless on our Japan trip to Tokyo and Kyoto.  This is not the first time we have been disappointed by Lonely Planet. They cater to backpackers only, usually looking for the cheapest accomodation and meals, and with no value added for the traveller who is short on time but still wants to make the most out of his/her time.  We ended up buying the Eyewitness Guoide which is fast and easy to use. +books
Disorganized+N+Abolsutely one of the worst self-help books I have read. There isn't any structure, and it's not simplistic. The advice given is helpful but the authors then reverse the whole deal. Its like one chapter says this will be helpful, and then another chapter says it wont. It just goes all over the place and you cant really follow what the authors are trying to get at.      A book I highly reccemend for anxiety and depressive related disorders is "Feel the fear and do it anyway" Much more simplistic, easier to read and get thru. And much more cheerful.       I also dont like that these authors have seperated anxiety and depression from one another. I guess they do have a new book coming out that combines them both. It will be interesting to see if they have learned anything from their last two failures.       But for someone that wants quick and easy advice, this book is certainly not for them. I'm afraid that this book of jargon will make it more confusing.+books
Great Synthesis of the Spiritual Disciplines+P+As a chaplain in hospice care and for a professional sports team I am always looking for books that synthesize larger topics or "weightier" works and bring practical applications to the forefront. Calhoun's contribution does an excellent job of presenting (succinctly) the necessary introductions into the spiritual formation practices that have been a part of the church for so many years. The greatest advantage for myself is the ability to use this book as a launch pad into other parts of the community that cover the various disciplines in greater depth or detail. And the practical aspects of the book make this a necessary purchase!  This book is a must read for lay leaders, an excellent resource for pastoral leaders, and a welcome addition to any church, school, seminary, or personal library+books

Faceless+P+Professor Swain wrote an incredible account of both black and white  representatives of African-Americans (both minority and majority districts)  in the US Congress.  She examines the history of blacks in Congress, the  definition of &quot;black interests,&quot; and the difference between black  descriptive and substantive representation.  The book was originally  written between the 1990 general election and the 1992 Presidential  election.  Although this may seem to make the book out of date, Dr. Swain  updated her manuscript with an addendum to the first edition.  This chapter  covers the Republican Sweep of the 1994 general election and discusses its  consequences to black descriptive and substantive representation.   'Black  Faces, Black Interests' can be highly relevent to the historically minded,  as the facts of the past shape the future.  In this end, the author can  have the most impact by educating readers, thus possibly touching the  future representatives of African-Americans+books
Unwaiveringly BIASED and UNBALANCED+N+Throughout this book Mr. Shulman denigrates the contribution of the Wright Brothers.  His bias is so prevalent throughout the book that I found myself shaking my head as I read blatantly contradictory statements within 5 lines of each other.  The author's opinions and accusations are either based on his limited research or his intentional omission of fact.  If you're even considering buying this book, I would direct you to the author's own words following a completely inane paragraph of conjecture about Orville Wright............&quot;Or perhaps not.&quot;  That about sums up this biased inaccurate ploy concealed in the history section+books
Fascinating read on the changing of Victorian society!+P+I just finished this nice long read, and I must say it was very well written: Trollope shows us a fascinating view of how the changes in society can affect the people living in it.  We are given a view of all sorts of characters: from the volatile, swindler Melmotte to the swaggering, gambling coward Felix Carbury, to his antithesis, his staid, country cousin Roger Carbury, and Felix's silly & conniving mother Lady Carbury, to his sweet & saintly sister Hetta Carbury...the mousey Marie Melmotte, the marriage schemer Georgiana Longestaffe, the wonderful yet fallible Paul Montague, and the independent & brash American, Mrs. Hurtle.  These & many other characters collide to give us a fascinating read, as their lives intertwine again & again, on so many levels.    The staid & proper upper-crust Victorian society of yesteryear is slowly melting away, as English virtue & honor is being overtaken by lying, cheating, swindling, stealing, and much more.  Where being a proper, honorable gentleman used to bring its own reward, now it is the more "modern" social rules that are taking effect in London society.  Will virtue or vice triumph in the end?  An excellent read, highly recommended!+books
So You Wanna Start a Revolution?+P+Common Sense is a must read for all citizens of the USA and world seeking liberation from long established regimes. In this short, but well written published pre-revolutionary work, Paine makes the argument for a complete separation from England.  In a time when many were not sure separation was the correct option, Thomas Paine spells out 100 % revolution in clear English that provided the spark for the Declaration of Independence. It was the straw that broke the camel's back and there would be no turning back. A true piece of fine USA history+books
A very difficult book to read.+N+Thsi book is for someone who has an extense knowledge of the Byzantine empire. I do not posses such knowledge and got lost inmediatly while trying to read this book. The author's style adapts for someone who knows all the history of the people involved in this empire already. I couldn't even finish the first chapter because I found myself asking: who is he talking about? every two  lines+books
Terrible Textbook+N+I am only partway through my organic chemistry course, but already I know enough about this book to give it a very negative review. It simply does not explain topics well enough. Also, The problems at the end of the chapters are simply not difficult enough to prepare you adequately for exams. Although I've never used any other textbook, this one justs seems horrible. I'm generally an excellent student and can learn from many different types of texbooks, but this one is just horrible.  I referred to 'Organic Chemisty as a second language' by David R Klein for a clear understanding of many topics such as fisher projections, asid base strength, predicting substitution and elimination reactionns, resonance, drawing chair conformations, determining the configuration of a stereocenter, and many other basic concepts which are not explained well in this textbook.   If however, you are going to use this book, I would highly reccomend buying the solution manual, it is difficult to use this book without it. The solutions manual (4th edition) repeats each question before giving the answer, so it also a valuable aid to use even without the book itself.+books
Worst travel book that I have ever read+N+OK, Buenos Aires is a spanish speaking city; but when every other word of a sentence in this book is full of spanish, it makes the book very very hard to read!!!! "Facts about Buenos Aires" is nothing but that, a list of useless facts emblished with unnecessary adjatives: "...something that differentiates Buenos Aires' people from their North American or European cousins - a striving melancholy and a desire for something greater." HM??? What we travelers want is an easy to read book, not a trash compactor, TOO much information one after another in a paragraph with vague english + foreign words is a waste. The few pictures in this book don't do justice to the city, take a look at any "paris" book out there, your response is usually "WOW, I would like to go there." after reading this book, it's like "hm... why do I want to go there?" Choose a different book; don't waste your time and money+books
scientists are human, science is not ahistorical...+P+Kingsland is biology by training therefore many scientific concepts in this book are very welled summarized and organized, making it easy for professionals and non-professional as well to grasp the general ideas in population biology. However, this book focus more on the historical context and the personality of some key scientists in this area, which gives readers more indepth understanding outside science itself. The auther did a wonderful job in interweaving science and human sides, and made it easy to pick up some major transitions in the history of population biology. highly recommmended to professional population ecologists, and general public who is interested in science as well! a bonus: some pictures of famous scientists in this area, such as McArthur, Lokta, Volttera etc...it's interesting to me, after reading all their work, finally had a chance to see what they look like+books
Very touching and inspiring+P+I really enjoyed this book.  Kendra Marty falls in love and wants to spend time with this young man, but she also feels the need to help her grandfather.

Know when to hold em and fold em.+P+This is a great book, I found it full of excellent ideas on how to judge the appropriate pot and hand odds. Would have gotten a five star but is somewhat complex ar times+books
Daughter loves it, but cleaning up is a nightmare!+N+The puzzles are great and a lot of fun for my two-year old. She loves anything 'princessy' so the princesses were a big selling point. However, after she did each puzzle a couple of times, the pieces didn't stay in the book. When we'd flip the page, all the pieces from that page would fall out. We ended up taking all the pieces out and putting them in a container, which is not the point of the book at all! At least the backs of the pieces are colored specifically for one puzzle in the book, and my daughter gets practice at sorting her colors for half an hour before we can play with her puzzles. +books
Ammie, Go Away!+N+This book is so bad I don't even know where to start.  I bought it based on many of the reviews on this page, and since I had previously read The Master Of Blacktower and loved it, I thought that this book would be similarly good.  I was terribly wrong!  Right away the dialogue ticked me off because real people don't talk the way that the characters talk in this book.  The dialogue (mainly involving MacDougal and Bruce) is filled with pompous remarks and ridiculous attempts to sound intelligent.  It is so forced that it makes you want to cringe (when they start arguing about Christian theory and the Middle Ages while Sara is passed out on the floor from demonic possession, you know that you should just stop reading now).  It is like in one of those bad TV movies where, when something terrible happens, all of the characters stand around and say "I wonder what we'll do?"  I cannot believe how bad this is.  The possession/seance thing is completely hokey anyway.  Don't waste your time with this one.  I couldn't even finish it.    +books
James Joyce: Genius or Madman?+N+Obviously both and Finnegan proves it. Joyce spent seventeen years on this book, which can be properly read and understood by only one person - James Joyce, who passed away in 1941.  Now if you'd like to devote yourself - and perhaps your life - to achieving an understanding of Finnegans Wake, you are certainly free to do so.  And, having once attempted  to achieve such understanding myself, I can assure you that some of your time will be well spent.  But the facts are as follows:  1. Joyce was fluent in a number of European languages and had a nodding acquaintance with many more.  2. From this knowledge he fashioned a special vocabulary of multilingual blends and puns which he used, with ordinary English syntax, to create the solipsistic discourse of Finnegans Wake. It is, in effect, a private language.  3. Since most of his vocabulary is drawn from, and puns on, the languages Joyce was familiar with, the only way one can begin to understand what's happening is to be as familiar with them as James Joyce.   4. The entire book is said to narrate the mostly incoherent nighttime dream of its antihero, "HCE."  This was Joyce's way of "getting at" (whatever that means here) some sort of unconscious European cultural mind - as apprehended and imagined by James Joyce, of course.  5. Finnegans Wake is thus basically incomprehensible. The explications in Campbell & Robinson's Skeleton Key, while well informed, are, as the authors admit (though not in these words) the only sense they could make of it with the assistance of a shelf full of reference books. By getting in on the ground floor, C & W effectively dared anyone to disagree.  Which would, of course, require another pair of literature Ph.D.'s with another shelf of reference books. There can be more than one interpretation of Finnegans Wake, including a belief in the profitlessness of interpretation.   6. Once in a while Joyce can still write a melodious sentence that is close enough to English to carry some meaning. As readers of Dubliners, Portrait of the Artist, and Ulysses are aware, Joyce was at one time a master of poetic English prose. Searching for the poetic moments, and those alone, makes for a pleasant diversion, and will undoubtedly reward the extremely well read and knowledgable.  If you're still intrigued, your best bet is to find a copy of the drastically abridged edition with commentary that Anthony Burgess put out forty years ago.  Burgess loved Finnegans Wake in the Campbell-Robinson interpretation, and he supplies enough editorial matter to aid you in your innocent quest to believe in Finnegans' greatness. The book may be  useful to some as a kind of Rorschach/I Ching for your own creativity: "How many puns and themes can *I* find?"  This book allegedly turned Derrida into a Deconstructionist. I believe it. Students of OCD and associated disorders should take a look at the entire Finagin Fannomenikonn, if you know what I mean. +books

What a Crock!+N+This book demonstrates the sloppy scholarship of a high-school dropout. His theology was discarded by his organization as soon as the megalomaniac died.  He was as wrong about history as he was about theology.  It has also been disclosed that he copied much of this book from another author's earlier publication.  This man has been discredited as a theologian long ago+books
Culinary and Personal Intrigue.+P+This is the sequel to LIQUOR, the first of the Rickey and G-Man mysteries.  This one is more fun, and I believe, more finely crafted.  There is less of the culinary aspect in this book, and more of the mystery-intrigue-New Orleans corruption "stuff', that makes these plots fun.  Rickey is his usual impulsive and volatile self, and G-Man, ever steady and calming, evolves into a more complex and active character.  Lenny is there, but he does not occupy too much of the book.  There are a few surprising "twists" in the plot, and if you are an astute reader, you will "pick-up" the clues.  If not, and that is VERY OK, you will find the resolution to the story line fascinating, and quite frankly, plausible.  I'm looking forward to the "3rd" in the series, if there is to be one+books
Good Overview+P+This was a well-written compilation that provides an overview of the lives and departures of certain notorious film entities over many years. The entries I most appreciated dealt with early icons, now barely remembered if at all, whose names inevitably produce the query: "Whatever became of -- ?" Appreciated even more was the author's willingness to reach conclusions about an individual's life and career. He delivered evaluations and even criticisms as warranted.

The Message of the Divine Iliad Contains a Real Jewel+P+The First Section of this book contains philosophical text which is typical and conversational.  It is in the second part, named 'The Secret of Light' where one can find the most clear, pure explanation of the universe imaginable, in the amount of text which normally fills a small booklet.  Complete with diagrams, the explanation begins with God and flows out to all basic logical systems in a spectacularly balanced fashion.  If you are a seeker, dont' miss out on this one+books
Awful book, could have been written in 10 pages.+N+Don't buy this one. This is just a bunch of blah blah blah written by a guy who does not master the English language, so he uses a lot of filler words just to pile up pages of useless information. Not even the examples at the end of the book are well laid. He used some canned spreadsheet tables to fill in things like "risky" - "medium risk" - "safe" etc... which is just a complete nonsense in Forex.  What really made me mad was the horrible way this book is written. This Russian author could have phrased sentences using less than half of the words he used. It's a no more than a 10 page book streched to more than a 100 pages of you know what. Lame+books
Cannot share the same Enthusiasm+N+I bought this book a number of years ago for apologetics purposes-- While I would agree with other reviewers that it holds a high view of Scripture, and the book definitely represents a lot of research, I think that the approach to symbology used here can be problematic.  The entire book is a study of constellations,  and how they display the Gospel in the Stars. While this is an interesting study I think there a oouple of underlying problems with this approach.   1.  Constellations and star names are simply assignments that man has assigned to stars.  Usually pagan cultures in association with their pagan mythology.  Although this does not completely undermine such a study it does call it into question. 2.  A second more serious problem is the same problem which underlies numerology and other allegorical approaches-- they can often be made to say anything the author even while at the same time appearing scholarly.    Those looking for apologetics in the cosmos should consider investigating the "anthropic principle" which tracks evidence of God's design of the universe.  One such book would be "Show me God" by Fred Hereen.  In terms of our faith, In my opinion, God's Word itself furnishes a lifetime of study without engaging in speculation of symbols which we really can't prove one way or the other. +books
There has to be a better guide out there+N+After seeing the five-star review for a previous edition of this book I was eager to buy it for my recent trip to Mexico City. Sadly, it fell far short of my expectations. For starters, the maps are woefully inadequate. There aren't enough of them, they lack sufficient detail, and there is no number and letter grid system. That last problem is inexcusable and made it nearly impossible to find many of the sights mentioned in the book. The overall organization of the book is also not done well and does not seem very logical. Making matters worse, the book is not bound well and actually started to lose pages before my relatively short trip even ended. I have had far better books than this when I have visited other parts of the world. I have to think someone makes a better Mexico City guide too+books
Great Manual!!+P+This is a wonderfully written book.  There is a section for every person to find something of interest.  There are several new things to learn here.  It is written in a very mature fashion and doesn't make you feel uncomfortable whatever your reading about+books
Please stop repeating yourself+N+Okay, maybe I am the odd ball, but this author drove me crazy!  He should have made a pamplet instead of a book.  I felt as though it was written by a Amway sales person.  To me, the book read like they were trying to motivate you to go ahead and build your house.  I needed factual information, and I got 90% &quot;You can do it&quot; and 10% &quot;This is the stuff you need&quot;.  If you are two years away from building, you might like it, but I was two weeks away and already had most of the information provided.  I am sending mine back+books
Outdated living on a shoestring+N+As you may have been reading in the other reviews, this book is very different.  Most of the suggestions are wacky, and really could only save you pennies to say the least.  Once in awhile, the suggestions are okay, if you own a home (which I don't because I don't have money) but if you followed every suggestion in the book you would be the laughing stock of your community.  There are much better books on the market for the purpose this book is supposed to serve.  If only they would update it, it wouldn't be half bad.  I mean, they talk about going to the library to use internet when almost everyone has internet on their phones nowadays and other wierd "hints" that just don't make sense.  They spend a whole section on just organizing your bills and putting them in places like a shoe organizer or an empty cereal box because this will help you save money.  Real frugal people would just save their money and skip the book to read something that will actually help you+books

A Book of the Century+P+Francie Nolan is a young Irish-American girl who lived in an ethnic slum in Brooklyn around the turn of the century. The story covers her turbulant childhood with little money and alcoholic father. It tells of the menial work her mother did each day as a housekeeper to keep the family together because her father could not hold down a steady job. Even though it was tough for the family, Francie was kept in school until High School so that she would become educated and not have to wash floors for a living like her mother. Also Francie was intelligent, idealistic and hard-working. She became very successful as she matured and got her first real job. The story is one of hope that will inspire all who read it. It illustrates the American Dream fulfilled through hard work and perserverance+books
Better than the first one, but....+N+This is the second book about a group of four best friends who go their separate ways for a summer, keeping in touch through writing and passing along a shared pair of jeans.  The characters in this story were likable.  I enjoyed reading the story from the various points of view.  I liked the ways the four girls supported each other through hard times.  However, I found much of the story to be utterly predictable.  From the moment I started reading, I could tell exactly how Tibby's experience at the summer program and her adoration for the "cool" kids would turn out.  I also knew what would happen when Bee tracked down her grandmother.  Carmen's mother's relationship followed an equally predictable arc.  Although the characters were good, I found the story lines too dull to really sustain my interest+books

Don't let this book be your introduction to Dash mysteries..+N+This reviewer is grateful that this book was not her first Dash mystery, because it would have been her last.  Ms. Benjamin is too talented a writer to be judged on the basis of what one can only hope is a major and temporary lapse in judgment.  If you're looking to try her work, go straight to her first book.  In this book, Rachel Alexander comes off as not very likeable:  wearing the victim's clothes and jewelry, sleeping with the victim's boyfriend, trying to live the victim's life....all of this has Rachel coming across as a rather sick voyeuristic woman...In fact, her treatment of the victim's boyfriend makes her a rather cruel and callous one.  This reviewer does not understand the purpose behind having the victim's dog witness the crime or how the dog even figures into the plot at all.  And not enough Dash in this book!  Dash is but a secondary decoration in this book...and Rachel even goes out into a dangerous situation in the dead of night, and leaves him behind!!! The only good things I can say about the book is the writing style is good and you will be kept guessing as to what happened in the victim's last moment until the book's end; the problem is that by that point, you'll not care if Rachel herself winds up sharing the victim's fate.  Ms. Benjamin is a better writer than this; her character needs rehabilitation after this book.....The readership deserves more Dash and less trash.....This reviewer's advice:  Only resort to this Dash mystery when you've read all of the others.....+books
Life transforming book+P+This is an enormous work and very important too, and even though it is difficult to present to a &quot;modern&quot; mind David Frawley has done a great job. The work consists of understanding and interpreting the Vedas properly, which are almost 6-7 thousands years old if not more and are written in Vedic Sanskrit, which again is more complex to understand and interpret than regular Sanskrit. This is a book is very important from the point of ancient India's (true) history as well as is extremely important from the point of view of world's history as we understand today. It is a book that also provides the much-needed encouragement and foundation for anybody seeking a spiritual way of life+books
Hawkins Descends Into Delusion & Misuse Of Dowsing+N+Dr. Hawkins first book, Power vs Force was interesting and presented a useful way to dowse using kinesiology.  However, he began to venture into misapplication of this method, and has now gone off on a tangent where he seems to wish to delude himself into thinking he has developed a fool-proof way to judge the level of consciousness of any entity, concept, or construct and the truth or falsehood of any statement.  There are serious logical, philosophical, and practical flaws in his work, and his attempt to quantify matters that aren't quantifiable leads to meaningless data that probably matches the bias & beliefs of those carrying out the muscle tests.  This book is a good example to present to show how people can deceive themselves and misuse muscle testing and dowsing techniques.  The actual technique is worthwhile, but much of what Hawkins presents in the book is utterly meaningless and invalid.  The levels of awareness that can be tapped into with dowsing are wise enough to NOT let us ask just anything we wish to and be able to receive accurate, valid answers.   Hawkins explores issues about media, politics, religion, spirituality, history, philosophies, healing arts, entertainment, and more, and reveals his own gross ignorance on many matters. He seems unaware that many of the people he trusts in politics and media are professional gangsters, liars, and two-faced sociopaths.  He has a negative view of conspiracy theorists, many of whom are genuinely determined to find the truth and don't resort to Hawkins' misguided shortcut attempt to identify truth.  Hawkins also fosters confusion with his description of his muscle test method, as it really has little to do with applied kinesiology, but is a form of dowsing where the muscle is directed to remain weak or strong in lieu of muscle response moving a pendulum or rod.  I hope Hawkins gets to reconsider his current efforts...consciousness and spiritual research are vital endeavors and there are others doing useful, responsible work in those areas.  For now I'd encourage Hawkins to recognize that 911 was in part an inside job, many conservative politicians and pundits are corrupt frauds, and the overall maturity of consciousness in America is not greater than the rest of the world+books
Guthrie Captures the West and the End of an Era+P+The Big Sky is the first in a series of great Western novels by A.B. Guthrie. The story begins in 1830 as young Boone Caudill escapes his Kentucky home for the plains and mountains of the west. He meets up with Jim Deakins, a pleasant country philosopher, early on his journey and finally the experienced mountain man Dick Summers on the keelboat trip up the Missouri.  I enjoyed Deakins' theological disquisitions. "You can't beat God for bein' picky. No, sir. If he catches you playin' cards or sayin' one swear word...it's to hell with you forever and ever...Even thinkin' is mighty dangerous. As a man thinketh, that's how he is, and to hell with him ag'in. Why you reckon he gave us a thinker then?...God is some busybody."  Guthrie takes us up the Missouri, a slow fight all the way, across the plains, into the mountains and back. He creates for the reader the palpable sense of the openness and wildness of the West. Yet the book steps back from fully romanticizing the end of the mountain man era. The story is often disturbing, not the least in Boone Caudill's quick and often brutal ways.  Highest recommendation for anyone interested in the American West.+books
All 13 stories+P+It looks like Amazon has taken the reviews of the audio casette set with the same name and put them on this product.  There are 13 stories and not 5 as the cassette reviews state.  They take up 6 CDs.    There is one technical flaw. The labeling is wrong on four of the CDs.  The number is correct (1-6) but the list of stories on 3 and 5 are swapped and 4 and 6 are swapped.  Once you solve that mystery things go well.    These are short stories and not novels so you should not expect complex plot development or character descriptions.  They are a good way to kill half an hour of otherwise wasted time in your life. +books

An HR Managment Tool to share with those "special employees"+P+There are employees who we know are smart and they conflict in any number of ways with management or with others within the organization.  This book helps HR managers help their business owners and corporation shapers get into the thick skulls of those  special employees that are shining stars on the verge of becoming supernovas.  Corporations many times are charged with terminating an employee or facing the challenge of having an employee that is extremely talented terminate their employment, only to find out that this is basically unnecessary if they can successfully negotiate the behaviors of the employees so that it better serves the businesses' need, not just the narcassist needs of the employee.  Yes, they work hard, but the company is in fact compensating them for that with the cars, cash and other perks they so successfully earn, and if they didn't perform, wouldn't earn those things.  It's time that business managers and their HR people  take back their responsibility and partnership of helping build successful employee careers by sharing with them the challenges and insights they face in building their companies successfully.  Fortune 500 executives face these challenges, just as smaller companies do.  Get Out Of Your Own Way At Work helps these supernovas realize before they self-destruct their careers, someone elses or far worse, the business' success, where they may be playing the part within this challenge, not just passing the buck and blame over to others, or taking advantage in ways that end up blowing up in their faces, making a mess of their futures or the company's.  I triped over this book as an HR manager searching for tools to help my business owner/manager successfully navigate a similar problem.   It should be required reading for all entry level employees (along with another favorite of mine "The Rules of  Work and The Rules of Management" .   Because employees step out of the academic world usually and then enter the business world, there are no hard fast rules, even if you attended an executive business university to guide you in how to manage yourself in the environment, or were raised with the self-disclipine required to be successful in the business world.  These tools  of knowledge are like boot-camp for entering the business world.  HR folks suffer in silence trying to help these people and because its really up to them to get the business procedures and policies of the company when told to them,  this book helps communicate to them what they don't get or what businesses usually don't think they need to communicate during the hiring process because any other behavior is cause for disciplinary action.    The behaviors described in this book suit all types of industries and organizations.  Dr. Goulston explains it so brilliantly and seamlessly, it's clear what our choices should be if we still exhibit the same behaviors after one is assigned to reading it because there is a chapter within the book about how the guilt of these descision effects us about the tough-love we should make if they don't get it.   For those rare few that your organization seeks to help and no end to the frustruation or how to communicate it to those that create it,  this book is a treasure for growth and  career development within the business environment, no matter what the employee's behavior is.  I believe that if applied the insights within this book can help prevent these behaviors from developing or derail if read early in one's own career.  Even if HR people read it and share the knowledge with their owner/managers, it will tune us and our business owners and corporations shapers into how to recognize it early enough in an employee to help manage to getting rid of it.  If you have anyone in your organzation that sounds like what I've described here, do yourself a favor and GET THIS BOOK and make it required reading within your organzation+books
Witten well but narrow in view ,  a self catharthis.+N+This book will be a great disappointment to many stroke survivors and their relatives, as it was to me, a survivor. It tells the story of one man in England, with moments that make you think there is a similarity, only to be disappointed.  The only hope for the book is the wife's diary, and her  feelings from the event through the treatment. But even then there is the  feeling that her diary in censored, knowing that it would be published. The  author does direct the reader to some other good books, and gives us a  happy ending. The book does teach us that life goes on, even if you have a  stroke, but stroke suvivors already know that fact+books

Not that well written+N+I usually really hate to critize a book like this, but this book was not  what I expected it to be.  This book was to be romantic suspense, but where  was the romance?  This book focused mainly on the mystery(which was solved  by the the time you reached the middle of the book), and then the story  kinda dragged on,  probably to finish the love story.  The love story was  okay, but there was no serious focus on it and it just kinda closed off.   In the end, for my first book by Krentz, it was not the greatest+books
Amazing Reading Experience+P+I first borrowed this book from the library.  I read it and had to own it.  I do not ever purchase books, I borrow them.  The writting is amazing.  That is the only word that even comes close to describing the experience of reading this book.  The feelings I felt while reading Traveling Light went from one end of the spectrum to the other.  Awesome+books
Excellent for Discipleship+P+This is an excellent book to use for teaching new believers the basics of Christian theology.  The chapters are concise and to the point.  It whets the spiritual appetite of the new Christian to go on and read the gold mines of suggested reading that are included with each chapter.  You can't go wrong with this easy to follow, down to earth volume+books
Class Action+P+This is by far one of the best books I have ever read. This is something our school kids should be required to read as well. The 2 ladies who wrote this book did an excellent job of telling Lois Jenson's real story. Her story, while tragic, needs to be told. The movie doesn't do this book justice+books
Master of the ironic twist.+P+A collection of 100 or more short stories by O. Henry?  My mouth waters already!  It's hard to imagine any literary treat that can be enjoyed in small doses more pleasurable than this.  I have spent over a year savouring these stories, reading them one by one, tasting his delightful choice of words, digesting his fascinating story-lines, and the warm satisfying afterglow that comes after a typical twist at the end.  O. Henry began writing short stories as a prison inmate, and he quickly fine tuned his skills behind the bars and developed into an excellent storyteller.  Born William Sydney Porter (1862-1910), he produced 270 stories under the pseudonym O. Henry. His stories are superbly outstanding in at least four ways, each illustrated with five of my personal favorites.  Firstly, his brilliant use of language.  These stories were written in the first half of the twentieth century, and O. Henry's use of language easily surpasses that of most contemporary writers.  Not only does he have an extensive vocabulary, but his writing abounds with similes and metaphors that breathe sparkling life and depth into his stories, marred only by the occasional "Lordy".  "Ulysses and the Dogman" is a fine example of his skills with a language, metaphorically portraying dog owners as victims of Circe, in a hopeless enchantment to their leashed pets.  Also exemplary is "Madame Bo-Peep of the Ranches" where a ranch manager has a heart fenced by barbwire just like the ranch on which he lives, and yet the twist at the ending suggests that perhaps we were completely mistaken.  "A Comedy in Rubber" uses wonderfully elevated language to farcically portray a class of people today known as ambulance chasers.  And "Sisters of the Golden Circle" revolves around the profound bond that exists between two married women who are strangers but yet sisters "of the plain gold band."  "An Unfinished Story" employs profound metaphors of angelic hosts to tell the tragic story of poor Dulcie's struggle for survival.  Secondly, his unique insight into the social conditions of his time.  O. Henry has a great understanding of the trials of the lower class, and he frequently pictures the lives of ordinary people of early twentieth century America with warm and sympathetic colours.  His characters are frequently the overlooked: the struggling shop girl, the unsuccessful artist, the impoverished.  Admittedly, some of his images can be hard to comprehend for modern readers, and the distance that time has placed between us and O. Henry's beloved New York means that some of his verbal pictures will be harder to understand and identify with. But his genuine sympathy for the oppressed cannot be missed. "The Gift of the Magi" is the signature O. Henry story, probably his most famous tale which recounts a poor young couple who both give up a prized possession in order to purchase a gift for one another - but ironically a gift intended to complement the other's prized possession that they have just given up.  Another story which display his ability to picture the social conditions of his time - but always with the trademark twist - is "The Pendulum", a wonderful portrait of the daily routines of an poor couple and the bursting anxiety of a married man, until the bubble bursts.  "The Cop and the Anthem" was the first O. Henry story I ever read, and humorously recounts the unsuccessful attempts of a man to get into jail for the winter - it remains vivid in my mind as a memorable favorite.  "The Furnished Room" is a tragic and shocking story of suicide, depicting the depths of despair and desperation of the impoverished.  Thirdly, his warm humour.  O. Henry has an uncanny ability to portray the mundane and the ordinary in the most elevated language.  Frequently he pits two characters together in a remarkable way so that one outshines and complements the other.  And on other occasions he crafts the most ingenious and humorous schemes for outwitting others.  One of his most popular stories is "The Handbook of Hymen", recounting the tale of two men in a winter cabin, one armed with the hilarious Herkimer's handbook of Indispensable Information.  And then there is O. Henry's fictional character Jeff Peters, a man who comes with the most ingenious money-making schemes, two shining examples displayed in "Jeff Peters as a Personal Magnet" and "The Exact Science of Matrimony".  "Let Me Feel Your Pulse" pokes fun at doctors, while in "Next to Reading Matter" an overly eloquent character wins the heart of a senora with streams of articulate talk about the mundane.  Fourthly, his ironic twist.  One of the distinctive characteristics of O. Henry's short stories is the ironic twist at the end, which never fails to surprise and entertain, sometimes reversing the entire story line in a concluding one-liner. O. Henry's suspense and trademark ironic twist ensures that readers who have a good literary taste in short stories will not be disappointed.  Like the Jeff Peters stories, "The Love-philtre of Ikey Schoenstein" also feature a brilliant scheme - but a scheme of romance - and the way it backfires is unforgettable.  Other delightful examples of ordinary stories with a glorious ironic twist include "Witches' Loaves" and  "While the Auto Waits".   The twist that comes at the end of "The Hypotheses of Failure" is so perplexing, that you'll have to re-read the entire story after reading the ending - but completely delighted at the way in which O. Henry has misled you.  But perhaps one of O. Henry's best uses of the ironic twist comes in "The Last Leaf", a warm and tragic tale describing how a dying artist proves as resilient as the last leaf on the wall outside, and through the self-less sacrifice of another.    The Wordsworth collection is superlative, because it contains more than 700 pages of literary gems.  It consists of 100 stories, showcasing a wide range of O. Henry's short-story talents.  A few popular favorites are missing, such as "Schools and Schools", "Shearing the Wolf", "The Green Door", and "The Pimienta Pancakes."  But the reality is that nearly all O. Henry's stories feature his trademark ironic twist, as they do his warm humour, his unique insight into the social conditions of the time, and his brilliant use of language, and that every story in this collection is a literary delight worthy of inclusion.  The inaccessibility of some references for modern readers does not prevent these stories from being always entertaining and enduring!  Don't pass up on these! - GODLY GADFL+books
Practical, yet somewhat naive+P+This book teaches you the best way to make money in the markets = confluence of levels combined with price action triggers. He teaches you almost everything on the market's technical behavior.   The naive part is that he uses, in my humble opinion, old school indicators - like 50SMA and 200SMA. Also, he relies on stochastics as an oscillator to show him overbought and oversold conditions. Of course, I wish this were true but I think in today's more volatile conditions - there should be more than that.   So what does there need to be? I don't know, but let me tell you one important thing: Just because you see tons of charts on his book with stochastics on overbought and then prices immediately pulling back, don't let that fool you into thinking that's how the market is _always_ going to behave.  It's an excellent primer because this is how discretionary traders should trade, simple yet effective, but sometimes I think it's a bit too much on the simple side.  4/+books
A Poet Remembers His Prairie Town+P+If one hears the name Sandburg, the first thing to come to mind is probably &quot;Fog&quot; or &quot;City of Big Shoulders.&quot;  But in reading this wonderful memoir, we are reminded of what a fine prose writer  the man was.  The tale of his struggling Swedish immigrant parents finding  their way in late nineteenth century America and young &quot;Charley&quot;  as he liked to be called, as the name Carl marked him as a foreigner, is a  fascinating glimpse of a bygone time and place. The interesting jobs that  young Carl took on, such as traveling the back roads selling stereo-optican  views, and his conversations with a civil war vet are rewarding and  insightful.  I believe this is a wonderful read for anyone with a love of  biography, history, or simply good storytelling+books
Can't understand after review it again.+N+This book is very vague. I found the main characteristic of Prof. Tanenbaum's book is that he likes to use abstract algebra to deliver his example. For example, in chapter 1 he talks about Languages, Levels and VM. He uses L0, L1, L2 to represent languages and M0, M1, M2 to represent virtual machine. For people already have prior knowledge of programming such as C, Java, when they read this they could easily reference to something they have already studied, but for me I still can not relate them very well. In contrast, in Randal E. Bryany & David O'Hallaron's book, the beginning of book gives out a concrete example: the C programming Language. I found the latter always work better even after took the architecture course two years later.  My point is for people who want to have clear idea of real world, you should pick another book. This book might be suitable for architecture theory(hopefully).+books
A Story She Should Have Kept to Herself+N+What is the exact need of academics to write their autobiographies? Case in Point: Hazel Barnes. An academic who was the first to provide a faithful translation of Sartre, she also wrote an excellent little study, An Existentialist Ethics. If she had left it at that, she might have been left with a nice little intellectual legecy, albeit, a mostly anomymous one as her books go out of print and more precise translations of Sartre become available. But she has to write her autobiography, and if there ever was a useless tome, this is surely it. Though well written, the reader will quickly come to the conclusion that there is nothing really to write about, nothing that couldn't have been captured in a magazine article for the New Yorker or the American Scholar, that is. I found it a surprise that she was, indeed, an existentialst, for she is surely among the most repressed people on the face of the earth. Not the stuff of existential heroism and certainly not the stuff to charge a person $20.00 or so dollars to read+books
Boring But Interesting.  Does That Make Sense?+P+The story is very boring.  A middle class family has high aspirations for obtaining upper class status and this `class consciousness' controls everything they think and do.  Despite their foolishness, one can't help but feel sorry for each character (with the exception of the mother) who continually finds failure and disappointment.  The characters are not developed to the point that I usually enjoy, and there are quite a large number of characters.  An interesting thing about the characters is, none of them are `good.'  Probably the closest thing to a good character is Virgil's Boss, Mr. Lamb.  But even he is a business monger, ultimately concerned with his own business.  This reflection on man is insightful.  In real life, are there any people without flaws?  Major flaws?  Even the Bible presents the heroes of the faith as people with big problems (King Solomon was a womanizer, David was a murderer, Peter was a coward, etc.).  In general, people are selfish.  Our motives are selfish, and our own desires drive everything we do.  However, often fiction reflects one or two main characters who are flawless.  In an attempt to make characters likable- reality is bypassed.  This doesn't happen here in Alice Adams.    I believe this book is about expectations.  The Adams' family lives in the false hope of a brighter future, all the while neglecting the life they are currently living.  I feel that this is the same discontenting experience that Westerners face.  Maybe this is even a reflection of the way the author wrote the book- seemingly slow, but with flashes of brilliant foreshadowing which gives hope to the reader that something more grand is on the horizon.     The story is interesting because of the absolute stupidity of this family, and the fact that it probably is a very real experience for many. The story, though slow, is written very well, and was very easy for me to read (a plus for me, I am a bit slow).   It is also interesting because even though the story takes place in America- it seems a different culture.  This different culture was interesting.  I think the difference came in that the story is supposed to have taken place in the South (a foreign country as far as I am concerned), and it probably took place in the very early part of the 20th century.  One aspect of Tarkington's writing that I appreciated was the way he foreshadowed things.  Maybe I appreciated the subtle foreshadowing hints because of the drudgery of the story, but whatever the reason- I think he did an excellent job.   +books
I agree with the folks from Santa Monica+N+We found the stories a joke. Lisa and I LOL ed at the  ha haaaa, see, twist in the 5 or 6 stories we read. I believe a person could buy any of the romance novels at the supermarket and get the same thing+books
Vague, wordy, confusing, and in need of examples+N+I found that if you want to learn the language of auditing, have another reference handy.  Often, the discourse goes on and on and on and could really be distilled down into a sentence or two that had a firm and grounded presentation.  There were very few examples so it was difficult at best to try to understand the often high-level conceptual frameworks that were constantly being presented.  I also noted quite a few editing errors that probably arose from cut-and-pastes that were not carefully reviewed.  Also, figures and diagrams were reused and were not carefully reviewed either as information was present that didn't apply to the new scenario+books
Please read this to your child!+P+I highly recommend this story to all children. I have a young son who is dyslexic--the book was recommended to us by his tutor. But as I was reading this I couldn't help but feel all children would benefit from hearing it. This book is a wonderful example of how children manage to overcome difficulties. It can also help show children to be more compassionate to those who are less fortunate. It is delightful+books
The start of one of the world's great fantasy series+P+How many times have you fallen asleep and dreamt you were in the fantasy world created by your favorite author?  I've only had that experience once in my life and my dream took place in Andre Norton's Witch World.  This author kept me turning the pages, not only for the cliff-hangers that the hero, Simon Tregarth gets himself into, but also for glimpses of a strange new, magical landscape.  She doesn't pile on the adjectives, either.  Her prose is remarkably clean.  Just read the lead sentence of "Witch World," which introduces us to ex-soldier, Simon Tregarth:  "The rain was a slantwise curtain across the dingy street, washing soot from city walls, the taste of it metallic on the lips of the tall, thin man who walked with a loping stride close to the buildings, watching the mouths of doorways, the gaps of alleys with a narrow-eyed intentness."  He is a hunted man, unjustly cashiered from the U.S. Army for dealing in the post-war blackmarket.  Since Simon had been labeled as a crook, he figured he might as well play the game.  After seven years in the underworld, surrounded by his enemies and a gunshot away from death, Simon treats himself to a decent last meal (Andre Norton heroes and heroines NEVER whine.  They assess the odds, then keep on slogging).  Enter the mysterious Doctor Petronius who persuades Simon that he has nothing to lose by vanishing from his enemies' gunsights through the Siege Perilous, a Cornish megalith that is rumored to be a gate to other worlds.  Simon leaves the restaurant with Petronius, almost positive that he is walking into a trap. Instead of the bullet he is expecting, our hero is transported to the foggy moors of a new world.  The action doesn't let up.  The first thing Simon does is rescue a witch from a nasty bunch of snake-headed dogs and hunters (we don't learn the witch's name until the very end of the book).  The next thing he knows, he's embroiled in a war where the good guys appear to be losing.  Simon allies himself with "a tall, proud-walking race with...the carriage of rulers and an odd weight of years upon them."  His new home, medieval Estcarp is a matriarchate, ruled by witches, whose powers depend on their continuing virginity.  Nevertheless, Simon falls in love with the witch he rescued.  The enemies that he and Estcarp must confront have invaded Witch World via a gate similar to the Siege Perilous.  The alien Kolder are technically advanced, with submarines and mind-control devices that they use to command their zombie soldiers.  Estcarp's only allies are the Sulcarmen, seafaring warriors and traders who lose their main port of Gorm to the Kolder.  Simon, his friend Koris of Gorm, the witch he rescued from the Hounds of Alizon, and a youthful soldier called 'Briant' tread the mysterious byways of Estcarp and its warring neighbors, in an attempt to track down and destroy the technically superior aliens.  Lifetime Grand Master of Fantasy, Andre Norton built well.  There are 35 Witch World (WW) fantasies, and the count is probably still rising even though this author passed away on March 17, 2005.   Many of the later WW novels were collaborations, and it wouldn't surprise me if her co-authors attempt to live on in the world that the Grand Master created.   I wish them well, but so far they have not managed to penetrate the brilliantly weird landscapes of Andre Norton's imagination.+books
Worst.  Book.  Ever.+N+This book is awful.  I read it, and I couldn't wait to finish it.  I would have flipped it in the trash can except I had to read it for school.  The characters are pathetic, there is no grasp of dialogue, and the author admits that it is the same thing as an F. Scott Fitzgerald book that was already written.  How it became a Newberry winner I will never know+books
A Charming Children's Book+P+I loved Richard Peck's 'A Year Down Yonder' it was sweet, funny, cute, and well written. I have been made a deffinite Richard Peck fan from reading this book, it's the first one of his books I've read.  'A Year Down Yonder' is about Mary Alice Dowdel, who has to leave her Chicago home to go live with her Grandma in Louisiana, when her father loses his job. Mary Alice is at first skeptical about living in this small town with Grandma Dowdel, but soon she realizes that Grandma is more than she appears...... and after that you'll just have to read the book.   You don't have to read 'A Long Way From Chicago' the preceding book to 'A Year Down Yonder' to understand it. So, please enjoy 'A Year Down Yonder' by Richard Peck+books
&quot;New Age&quot; Soap Opera+N+How anyone can believe that there is a power to help people live a long life goes beyond my comprehension. This is what Estes claims in this book. What about those who live short lives? The whole book is geared at American middle-class readers who in general, even though   they have college-education, are very naive. The language is that of the fairy-tale, or close to it,  which suits a tv-fed and tv-indoctrinated people. Estes says that pain will clarify everything.  I pained myself through her book and nothing was clarified+books

Colonial conspiracies and drama+P+Similar to other books in his US history series, Vidal engages the reader immediately into conspiracies and dramas by introducing a wide panorama of characters. Vidal is able to use Burr's assistant, Charles Schuyler, as the chief storyteller, allowing the narrative to skip around through time. Vidal likes to have the narrator tell the reader that the past "isn't like it is now," which he would not be able to do if the story followed a strict chronological series. Characters are given incredible depth as they all have their dark faults to go with their heroic strengths. Vidal takes shots at the big guys. Some shots are substantial (like saying Washington was a poor leader who never lead the Army into a victory and only won the War because of France) and some are petty (Washington repeatedly viewed as having a "big butt" and often referred to as "waddling"). Jefferson is especially scrutinized. Besides the ubiquitous presence of light-skinned slaves insinuated to be of the Jefferson line, Jefferson is portrayed as a cold, calculating "philosopher king" who uses the constitution when it supports his causes, but calls for "states rights" when the constitution contradicts him.  Aaron Burr, who despite all the nasty politicking going on around him, is portrayed as a gentleman who is constantly antagonized by his peers for trying to do the right thing. How he obtains so much power in the state of New York is not really pursued except to say he is a war hero. Also, Tammany is often mentioned in the background, but Burr's involvement is not pursued. However, Burr is always described as having control of the New York constituencies that he can influence when making deals with the Virginia "junta."  My only negative critique is I find it hard to believe that Burr was vilified by conspirators without having character flaws that might have contributed to his rise and fall.  Burr is always the benevolent gentleman while the other power mongers of the day (Washington, Jefferson, and Hamilton) are self-aggrandizing double-crossers without conscience. Vidal freely flings the mud at other historical heroes, but seems a little too defensive and paranoid about the reputation of Aaron Burr. Still, the book is rich with historical vignettes of Burr's meetings with various patriotic heroes. Vidal writes with enough veneration to let you know the characters are great and enough vindication to make them real.+books

Terrible support.+N+Book read fine, but a simple question regarding whether her software plugin was a 1 time or monthly fee has gone unanswered 6 times via her contact information listed onher website mentioned in the book. Makes me wonder how sincere she is+books
A difficult read if you just want the meat+N+Maybe this book contains some good advice. But I gave it a low rating because you have to wade through so much fluff to find it. I seriously doubt I'll make it all the way through the book.  The first part of the book talks about Michael Gerber's (fictitious?) mentee Sarah, a previous client of his who has apparently fallen and can't get up. The conversations between Michael and Sarah are so contrived and syrupy, who can believe them? Sarah needs to climb a mountain in Nepal, discover the meaning of life, and get it over with.  The second part, which I'm reading now, is structured around the 7 "disciplines" for building a company. I skipped ahead to this part, but it refers back to so much of the fluff in the first part that I really feel lost not having read it.  If you like business story books of the Patrick Lencioni variety, you MIGHT get something out of E Myth Mastery. But be warned: This book as many times longer than Lencioni's, with a lot less meat+books

Disappointing+N+The book starts on the premise that competitive strategy is a complex subject and that Michael porter did give us a good structure/framework to analyze this phenomenon to succeed in the market place. Then the author is quick to add that among all forces analyzed by porter, "barriers to entry" is the most significant factor that affects competitive strategy. This is how the author sets the stage to explain "Competition Demystified"  With this quick and firm conclusion on the most significant factor affecting competitive strategy, the book starts off with case after case to justify this hypothesis. To simplify things, it looks at sustained profit margins and continuity of the key players in the given space as a proof for entry barriers. This approach is perhaps to support the second part of the title of the book "A Radically Simplified Approach to Business Strategy ". Granted that the cases discussed do justify the assumptions and are supported by hard facts or published numbers. But if competition lends itself to just a couple of variables, then every company can follow the strategy and hence no competition at all!. In fact one can say "The end of competition". Kindly recall "The end of history..."  The book however deserves praise for use of  Game Theory in a simple non mathematical approach to analyze competitive situations and the behavior of the players. But again, this approach is just a part of the problem and not a full explanation of competitive strategy.   Given the speed of globalization and technological changes especially the internet in the last decade, the book fails to incorporate such forces that significantly affect the success of global firms.  Too voluminous, and fails to impress on what it sets out to accomplish. +books
"A Visit in the Damp and Dark Will Serve Much Better than the Lark..."+P+Donna Jo Napoli's trademark technique of fleshing out a fairytale is in fine display in "The Magic Circle," her retelling of "Hansel and Gretel". Napoli's stories often reveal motivations behind some of the action that takes place in the traditional fairytales, reasoning out some of the fantastic elements and explaining the behaviour of the familiar characters; which usually results in the villain becoming more sympathetic and understandable. Such is certainly the case in "The Magic Circle", in which she explores the background of Hansel and Gretel's wicked witch.  The hunchback woman is known as the Ugly One by all her neighbours, but has the gift of healing which she uses to aid pregnant women and sick people in her medieval Europe community. She is the proud mother of a beautiful little girl called Asa, and enjoys her simple life as midwife in her country cottage. But her friend Bala has other ideas, getting her work with wealthy families and in researching demonic activity so that Ugly One may earn some more money - with much of the proceeds going to Bala of course.   Ugly One is unsure about extending her talents to exclude exorcisms, knowing the danger is extremely great, but as a devout Christian and a healer she feels compelled to comply with Bala's wishes - surely God will aid her, and no harm will come to her if she places herself within a magic circle that will protect her from the demons' tricks. After cleansing a little boy from a demon's influence, Ugly One knows that she has found her new calling in life.  But once several years pass, her confidence in her own abilities grow and in a mistake that will haunt her forever, she is careless with the protective magic circle. What follows is an escalating series of events that has her transformed into a witch by the vengeful demons and tied to a stake by the terrified villagers. Bartering with the demons for her daughter's life, Ugly One manages to use her newfound malevolent powers to escape and hide in the forest.  In Napoli's book the term `witch' is used in the traditional Christian sense, not the New Age one, so be prepared for a negative usage of the word (personally I found it quite refreshing this way - evil witches are so rare these days!) However, it's not so black and white, for though Ugly One can no longer shed tears, bleed or sleep, has demons whispering in her ears and an appetite for children, she is determined to not give in to her weaknesses. Living in isolation, she manages to keep the demons at bay - until she hears the voices of two lost children outside her home...  Napoli's story is poignant and thought-provoking, as she raises questions concerning the nature of evil, the will of God and the strength of the individual against temptation. Like all her other books, her spin on a traditional folktale is fascinating and will change your perception of "Hansel and Gretel" forever. Although her interpretation of the gingerbread house is a little weak and a revelation concerning Bala is raised only to be ignored, "The Magic Circle" is an intriguing little book. The demons and magical rituals mentioned are all based in real Biblical and Occult study (so you'll learn something practical alongside the retold fairytale!) and its length means you can probably finish it within a day. Though it is not my favourite Napoli novel (that would have to be "Zel" and "Spinners"), "The Magic Circle" is a great little read.+books

Substandard Text or Reference on RF Electronics.+N+This is a required text for a graduate level RF electronics course I am taking.  I am very disappointed with this text.  There are multiple mistakes and misprints throughout.  It seems that the book was proofed by  someone who is not familiar with electronic symbology and notation.  There  are many instances where inconsistant notation will be used within a single  example problem!  The author is very short on many subjects and longwinded  on others.  This book makes for a confusing and frustrating read despite  the distinguished IEEE brand on the cover.  My professor even commented on  the sloppyness of the author.  I have had to buy additional books to  suppliment my studies.  This is not a good reference or text book....Coming  from someone who has read multiple technical text books...Beware of this  one+books

I found the sections on the different flours and how to rotate my diet very useful+books
I would have to disagree with others+N+While this book does offer some insight to the pitfalls of &quot;all too common&quot; web mistakes, I have to disagree with the author's conclusions in many cases. In particular, he seems to place blame a lot on web developers as though we are often irresponsible, responsible for poorly written content, lackluster site maintenance and other &quot;bloopers&quot; as he calls them. Fact is, most web developers would love to spend the time &quot;investing&quot; in doing a thorough job. However, in many cases, the client often doesn't want to pay the additional monies to do a thorough job. While there is enough blame to go around in poor web design, it seemed all to common for the author to blame the web developer for critical mistakes. I also take exception to his commentary at times, in specific, his early mention of Enron and an obvious sarcastic knock against the company. He points to a bold claim Enron still makes on its site as to its size and stature. While Enron may have troubles, it's still a viable company with many assets and still provides services to many customers. We can do without the authors injection of cynicism and personal feelings about the company to prove his point. Lastly, I found the layout to be a little difficult to read. Often, the author would reference figures that were one to two pages ahead making you have to skim forward to see what he was talking about. The book is a very large format and anyone with a better sense of book design could have done a better job laying out this book. These are only a few points in a long list of what's wrong with this book. While the author makes some valid points, I found this book a little too much to stomach. Read at your own peril+books
The Type of Work History Needs More of.+P+The Great Warpath is a comprehensive integration of archaeology and history, the type of book history needs more of to make past subject matter more tangible and believable.  Ironically, there are surprisingly few works  which supplement history with archaeology or vice-versa.  With The Great  Warpath Starbuck fills the vacancy as he carefully balances the two fields  and raises archaeology to a new level of importance.  Specifically, the  book deals with British Military history in the late 18th century as  Starbuck interprets it from his many years as an archaeologist.  All the  major sights of the French and Indian War in New York State are covered, as  well as a few sights from the American Revolution.  The Great Warpath  refers to the Hudson River, the main corridor in New York State, along  which military engagements of the French and Indian War, and the American  Revolution occured.   Undoubtedly, The Great Warpath has something to offer  every military historian who is not satisfied solely with the limits of  written history+books
the emperor has no clothes+N+This book may be written about a fascinating literary figure at an interesting time in our history, with a potentially atmospheric setting and an intriguing mystery to boot--but it all adds up to nothing when the prose is so bad. I listened to about half this book on tape, but found I just could not bear another minute of it. It was stilted, repetitive, and trite. The language used in dialog and at moments of high drama was just plain embarrassing. Some suggest that the author was trying to emulate the way people spoke in the 19th c, but I don't believe anyone in history would've been this ponderous or repetitive in everyday speech; if so, such conversations are best forgotten.  I love mysteries and historical fiction, but have read boilerplate novels in these genres which are far less agonizing and more entertaining to read.+books
Review of the Voices+P+Most of these reviews address the book not how the production did with its presentation of the book. My opinion, it was wonderful. I know its a generalization but I wish more audio books were like this, like old 50's radio shows. It makes the book become alive. The casting was well-done. The voices are what I imagined them to be, maybe better. If only one person was narrorating this book (like most are done now) then this book probably wouldn't be as much fun to listen to on CD. So, if you have a choice to either listen to one voice or many voices with some amusing sound effects, pick the latter+books
I might use a total of two tricks...+N+I hate leaving bad reviews of things because I know someone is trying to make money and I don't want to hinder that.   Truth is that the concept of this book was exactly what I was looking for, but it didn't have anything special in it. I might use a total of two tricks. Most of the things just come off as stupid or little clever games (i.e. with matches)... but very little magic or tricks+books
US Centric - Not for Ex-Pats Living & Working at Country Ops+N+Long time reviewer, first time critiquer.  Enough to move me to take time out of my precious schedule to write.  As an American living and working abroad for a US based pharmaceutical company, the working mother lifestyle is entirely different.  The 100 Best Companies to Work only applies to the U.S. headquarters.  The reality is different for the subsidiary or country operations, where resources are limited and the culture is not supportive of the "flextime" approach.  In fact it is worst, because country operations are forced to "nudge" the books and offer what they call contractual permanent roles (not the equivalent as an employee role), which deprive the working mother of the necessary benefits needed to achieve a work-life balance.  As an American living in Australia, I am appalled, if not dismayed by this severe discrepancy.  For Ex-Pats living abroad, don't be fooled by the list. +books

Disingenuous Argument+N+Larry Arnhart is a serious, perceptive ethical philosopher whose works deserve praise (and to be read), but this book is a failure. The arguments are weak and will certainly fail to convince most "conservatives" to embrace Darwinian evolutionary theory.  Evolutionary biology is scientifically correct, which is the main reason it must be accepted by anyone, whatever their political philosophy (Arnhart does not stress this). However, Darwinian biology can be either used or ignored in making political arguments, so I will rephrase the issue as: are there good arguments flowing from evolutionary biology for conservative political philosophy?  We must note that at least in the USA, there are two quite different branches of conservativism, one espousing religious fundamentalism and the other classical economic liberalism. They have almost nothing in common intellectually and are simply politically linked by historical events. Arnhart does not stress this point.  Arnhart's arguments directed towards religious conservatism can be summarized as: (a) evolutionary biology is compatible with belief in God; (b) evolutionary biology recognizes and reinforces the notion that religious belief is a universal element of human nature; and (c) a strong adherence to family values is part of human nature. I agree with these statements, but Arnhart never addresses the burning issues, which include abortion, homosexuality, gay marriage, and state-religion separation. He does deal with intelligent design, which he rejects as a scientific theory. This is in part why I call his book "disingenuous:" he simply avoids the hard topics.  Turning to classical liberalism, Arnhart says that Darwinian evolution supports a Burkean political philosophy. I think this is a plausible argument, although Arnhart avoids all the hard questions by choosing as the alternative political philosophy an absurd caricature of the leftist alternative that is more or less 19th century Utopianism. Societies grow organically, Arnhart says, and cannot be socially engineered using the principles of Reason alone. Of course this is correct, but this is accepted by all relevant political philosophers today (except Peter Singer and his bizarre ilk). What about the proper extent of government, the treatment of poverty, the environment, and foreign relations? Nothing here.   I am not a conservative, and I don't think much of conservative political philosophy, but if I were, I would not be moved by Arnhart's arguments (I am also not a liberal, by the way, and in fact I think the liberal/conservative dichotomy is a sick joke, but that's a topic for another day...)   +books

Bland+N+I don't know what is up with the Entrepreneur-magazine series of books, but I've read several of them now and I've yet to be impressed with any of them. The best way to describe this book...BLAND AND FULL OF FLUFF. Most of them are apparently written by people who have NO real-world business experience. They are not recommended+books
Easy to Understand, Hard to Put Down+P+This book is a brilliant example of mathematics at it's best. It is from Scientific American, so you know you can trust it. And it is written at an understandable level, quite a feat for many very complex topics. The book features incredible illustrations, every concept is laid out in a colorful image. If you like the works of M.C. Escher, you will like this book. It has a lot of substance to it, and it will keep you busy thinking for a long time, and that's time well spen+books
5 stars are not enough!+P+This is surely one of the greatest collections of 'linked short-stories' ever written -- it matches Calvino's COSMICOMICS and Borges' LABYRINTHS. Lem is a total genius. A writer of playful little fables that are also philosophically profound (and logically consistent). This book is a brilliant companion to Lem's THE CYBERIAD, with which it shares many themes and ideas. Lem has a beautiful style: he can make engineering terms sound poetic. His rigorously modern metaphors are as original as those of J.G. Ballard, but more varied and lyrical. For Lem, the Periodic Table is an unwritten poem. This book is the final and true ode, and each line is a fantastic, fabulous, incredible story. I give this book 200,000,000 stars. And that's only because I'm not feeling so generous today. It probably deserves A GOOGOLPLEX (1 to the power of 100 raised to the power of 1 to the power of 100) of stars. At least+books
Off His Head: A Silly Plan to Replace the Welfare State+N+No serious economist would take such a proposal, well, seriously. In short, Murray's argument is foolish.  Inflation would eat up the redistributed $10,000, and, unless the "gift" money were indexed to inflation, that $10,000 would be worth about $100 in a couple of years. Inflation would come in many forms: higher rents, higher food and fuel bills, etc. For example, an important reason for a food stamp being a food stamp is not just to ensure that the money is spent on food, but also to ensure that more paper money isn't loosed upon the economy causing unforeseen inflationary pressures. Food stamps do not cause inflation; Murray's program most certainly would.   Buy the book if you want, but be sure to brush up on your economics as you read this absolute and utter nonsense.+books
Loved it!+P+It was a good book, but I thought it was a woman for a long time because of the depth of thought. Men just don't think like that, and the author put too much thought process into everything+books
Self Defence+N+Disappointed with the written content. Too much irrelevant, adolescent street jargon.  Illustrations were poor as were the written descriptions of techniques. Overall a disappointing buy+books
For those who are 'white knuckling their way through sobriety...'+P+As a talk show host I am accustom to being inundated with requests from PR folks trying to get me to book their particular client on my show to plug their book. Since I didn't like my current events show to be a blatant advertisement for a writer, I generally delete these types of solicitation ...25 times a day. In fact I had hit delete on the email regarding Chris Prentiss's book just as my eye caught a phrase and I had to actually retrieve the message. It was the cure rate of better than 80% that got my attention, and triggered my skepticism...along with a tiny sliver of hope since I knew how many times friends and members of my own family had fallen off the wagon. I booked Chris for 15 minutes and they sent me the book. A few days beforehand I thought I better skim the book so I could ask him some tough questions. I read the entire book and called the pr representative back and booked Chris for the entire show. I think what hooked me was Chris's comment about observing an AA meeting where people were `white knuckling their way through sobriety". Controversial statement. And true for too many. The book was specific about the path. Find the underlying cause(s). Work on that. The true story of his son's journey was engaging and encouraging. For weeks and months after the show I received emails and phone calls from listeners: "What was the name of that guy again? What's the name of his book?" Of all the shows and topics I have covered in 17 years on air, I have never received such a response.  +books
JOB APPROVAL DOWN TO 38%+N+and falling...The cover photo makes Bush look thoughtful, somber and deep. What a crock! The president isn't "misunderestimated". If anything this administration was given a free ride after 911. (Where IS Cheney, BTW?) And Dubya, who has yet to string together a coherent sentence, is an embarrassment. That vaunted Yale degree has to be courtesy of the elder Bush's wealth and connections. How can Bill Sammon can write such tripe in the face of this inane war, nation-building, huge deficits, and the sophomoric, cavalier mentality of Bush? Hey Sammon, we've now been in Iraq 2-1/2 years. It isn't enough that we've donated several hundred billion to build state of the art hospitals, roads, electrical grids, etc. for these people? BTW, there is concern there aren't enough educated Iraquis to actually operate these facilities. It isn't enough that Iraqis gas up their vehicles for pennies per gallon while U.S. citizens pay ridiculous prices. The Iraquis are still letting our people do all the heavy lifting - and dying. Only 1,500 Iraqui troops are adequately trained to date? You have to wonder if these people have the desire or the guts to defend their own freedoms. Speaking of defense, when is Bush going to do something about the southern borders with Mexico. Illegal immigration is up 23% since this man took office and we are paying a heavy price. AZ and NM have already declared a state of emergency. Texas is overrun. Illegals are overwhelming schools, emergency rooms, welfare systems. Meanwhile Bush bicycles on his 1600 acres of Texasss brushland, kisses Vicente Fox's behind, panders for Latino votes to maintain power, and refers to peaceful U.S. citizens trying to monitor our borders as "vigilantes". But he protects the borders of Iraq and Afghanistan with our military. This man is at the least incompetent, and at the worst treasonous. I'm embarrassed to admit I voted for this dumbkopf.+books
Why on earth would you want a Bible commentary from Morris?+N+Henry Morris is neither a scientist nor a theologian. He's a hydraulics engineer-turned-author who's obsessively promoted the 7th Day Adventist doctrine of a "young earth creation" far outside the SDA denomination - doing nearly incalcuable damage to many churches. He's since gone on to promote the "King James Only" cult group which further seeks to spread 7th Day Adventist false doctrines among Baptist Fundamentalists, and even promoted a sort of astrology among Christians! Jesus said we'll know them by their fruits - Morris' fruit is churches ripped apart over the age of the Earth, and seekers convinced that the Bible isn't true because of Morris' bizarre interpretation of Genesis. Morris deserves nothing but a firm, unsympathetic rebuke for distorting the Bible, slandering other Christians ...and lying about science+books
Very little information about strings+N+This book was a disappointment, while there is some excellent background on the structure of matter and quantum mechanics, there is very little on the topic of superstrings. In reading through it, I got the impression that the segments on strings were an afterthought, something that needed to be mentioned but in no great detail.   If you need some knowledge of quantum mechanics and the historical development of the understanding of matter, then this book is worth reading. However, if your interest is first and foremost that of the current theories of strings and superstrings, then quite frankly this book is not worth your time and money.+books
Good Beginning to Series+P+After working in a church in Boston and another in Washington, D.C., minister Ed Wilcox and his family have transferred to the Consolidated Community Church in Emerald Springs, Ohio. His wife, Aggie, initially has her doubts about settling down in a small town, but eventually she, Ed, and their two young children find themselves making friends, except for elderly parishioner Gelsey Falowell who despises Ed and wants to get rid of him. Gelsey's wish may come true when the naked body of a murder victim is left on the Wilcox's front porch and Ed, who had been counseling the dead woman, is the chief suspect. Aggie knows that Ed is innocent but wonders why Ed is keeping secrets from her especially when her daughter Teddy tells her she saw her father fighting with the dead woman. When a second murder is committed and detective Kirkor Roussos seems to suspect Ed committed both crimes, Aggie, with the help of her friend, real estate agent Lucy Jacobs, begins investigating the murders. The more Aggie looks into the crimes the more she realizes that people, especially Gelsey, have secrets that have been buried for years and some people will kill to have them remain secret.  "Blessed is the Busybody" is a good beginning to what looks to be a good mystery series. The characters are well written and well defined. The mystery is written from the view point of Aggie, revealing various bits of her unconventional childhood, plus her struggles to raise her children especially oldest daughter Deena, who at eleven is just starting to rebel a little bit. Both Teddy and Deena are well written and come across as real children. Aggie's friend Lucy is so well written that I could picture here while reading the book. Ed comes across as a bit bland, but I suspect that will change in future books. Author Emilie Richards does a good job describing small town life and the secrets hidden there and the town itself was like a character in the book. The mystery is well written with plenty of surprising secrets slowly revealed as the book goes on. The mystery is complex yet satisfying, if a bit sad. But there's a nice gentle humor throughout the book that takes the edge off the sadder elements.  "Blessed is the Busybody" is well worth reading.+books
Wish there was more+P+This is a great sampling.  I am a hotel concierge and I'm always looking for new/overlooked places to impress the guest who thinks he's done it all.

try this without sound or sub-titles+P+Yes, I have seen Seventh Seal many times, and it is, indeed, stark.  The other night I watched the new Criterion DVD I was gifted with the lights out, the sound off and volumes one and two of Coil's 'Music to listen to in the dark' popped in the stereo. I mean, once one has once seen Seventh Seal, there is nothing to the plot. (I won't say that of the dialog because I don't speak Swedish.) It's like Oedipus Rex.  This is a Swedish movie. Everyone in it looks Swedish. (Even death). Death is beyond anything from Bill and Ted, yet (without Seventh Seal) would we even have Bill and Ted?  I just like to watch these Swedish people talk. Perhaps the longest scene in the movie is shot on a beach, the horizon at mid-screen, and the entire top of the screen contains a horse, stamping, moving about, never still for but a moment. It is imagery that takes your breath away. As an image it is more than I could ever hope for, incomprehensible and compelling. Add Max Van Sydow, and, well, whatever! It's not a movie that you should intend to understand. It's just beauty to watch and think about later. Maybe always+books
Tourist Tramp+N+What a disappointmet!  What I was hoping would be a useful tourbook full of interesting facts about world bathing cultures and history turned out to be a lurid expose of Brue's downward moral spiral -- her characters would be mortified to read passages that recount how she was "not supposed to tell", how she rationalizes her infidelity (poor, poor Charles -- let's hope you stopped paying the bills and rent and moved out).  Her superior attitude is unearned and unwarranted -- what gives this 27-year-old the right to lord herself over those with more experience and aptitude?  Another reviewer compared Brue's writing to Bill Bryson.  I have news for you -- Bryson has a sense of wit and humor as he vivisects cultural (and human) anomalies.  Brue is just plain cruel and mean -- where's the fun in that (for the reader).  Shame on the editorial staff at Bloomsbury for buying into a good concept (it was a good concept) and letting it go to seed.  Brue's experiences are best left to the diary.  Instead of elevating bathing studies into the pop limelight, she sends it to the red-light district where she is infinitely more comfortable.  And the net result -- she, her readers, and her contacts all suffer from bad research and bad writing in this self-serving piece of trash best left on the beach, buried and unread+books
Alot of Fluff+N+This book has some good information in it, but it is mostly fluff, filler and repetition. Each time I sit down to read it, I fall asleep because there is so much filler. The book could easily be reduced to a pamphlet-sized book without any sacrifice of information.  I like to know how and why, and I don't mind reading on and on if the how and why is explained. I even enjoyed the China Study, which has a lot of explanatory text to support statements. Most people would call the China Study a dry read, but every word has a purpose. The Miracle of Fasting is mostly just empty words with statements only weakly backed up by the author's personal observations, not science. I think there are some useful tidbits in this book, but I would suggest you borrow this book from a friend or the library if you can. I am hoping to find a more comprehensive book on the subject of fasting. Any suggestions+books
The lights are going out all over Europe...+P+"The Guns of August" documents the events, conversations, strategies, and expectations that unfolded across Europe from July to September 1914.  To brutally paraphrase the 500 pages of Barbara Tuchman's genius....in regards to the outbreak of World War I, virtually everything that was expected didn't happen, and everything that could have gone wrong did.  Contrary to the "domino effect" jargon we're taught in high school (the war was a spontaneous reaction to Archduke Ferdinand's assassination), Tuchman illustrates quite convincingly (as German primary sources have supported...read Kaiser Wilhelm II and General Moltke's speeches and memoirs), this war had years in the planning.   In the movie "Thirteen Days", President Kennedy uses the book as a means to deride his hawkish generals and what he considers their poor sense of long-sighted policymaking.  He uses the mistakes made by the generals in "The Guns of August" as examples.  But the book is not about the idiocy of generals, or even politicians.  The book does not lay blame or point fingers.  And when the book does pass judgment (stubborn Joffre's Plan 17 should have been aborted much sooner), it reciprocates in later pages (Joffre's stubbornness helps turn the German right flank).    The one question underlying the entire book is "What if?"  What if the Belgians at Liege hadn't fought?  What if von Kluck hadn't swung his First and Second Armies inland?  What if Britian had refused to add its troops to the French Sixth Army?  What if the German captain hadn't been killed and the German HQ battle plans not been intercepted?  Every page offers these "What ifs", and it keeps the reader on his/her toes.  This book also shuts up the armchair generals who glance over a war, like a road crew worker on Monday morning discussing a football game, and says, "What idiots...why didn't they do this?  Why didn't they do that?  How could they not see what was coming?"  "The Guns of August" answers these questions, and when the situations are examined up close and personal, it's clear that the men running Europe made about as reasonable, logical, and cautious decisions as can be made in wartime.  We have the luxury of not only hindsight, but of viewing the war as a whole.  In the middle of the war, a field officer knows only the battle around him and what information he receives from other officers.  Spread a rumor around your work or school, and in a single week see how distorted the rumor has become from the original one you spread.  Now pass a vital piece of information up and down lines of divisions and corps and armies during a full-fledged world war and see how great your communication is.    You don't need to be a military historian to follow this book.  There are maps to help the confused reader.  If there are wartime lessons to learn from the book, they are these:  remain strategically flexible, know your enemy, and plan for contingencies+books
No, don't use this.  Really.+N+I like Eyewitness Guides a lot, particularly for their glossy graphics combined with comprehensive information, but this really doesn't make the cut.  How is it possible to cram Scotland into 224 pages? Well, it is not.  Besides having very poor coverage on Glasgow and particularly Edinburgh, it also has - well, more poor coverage.  Maps for the bigger islands in Northern Scotland are sorely lacking.  More effort has really got to be invested in making this guide before it is worth your money.  I know DK can make some really great guides, so it saddens me that they are now churning out trash like this+books

Holy vs. Whole+P+Mention the word "sadism" and the results it produces will vary from an embarrassed Victorian blush to righteous indignation that such things should exist at all, not to mention it being a topic for discussion among proper and civilized human beings.  Yet to Thomas Moore, a former monk and Jungian analyst and writer, it is precisely this topic that needs to be explored mentally, even spiritually, in order to prevent it from erupting into anti-social, or even criminal acts in the flesh.    Examining the writings of the infamous Marquis de Sade, Moore delves into the healing role of de Sade that digs deeper than the surface appearance of de Sade as pornographer to find value in what is cursorily dismissed as naught but tasteless perversion.  According to Moore's analysis of de Sade's writing, the virgin needs the libertine to complement her chastity, as much as he needs her pristine purity to define who he is.    Yet, a deeper understanding of Moore's treatise on de Sade reveals that wholeness is the object of the soul's journey, and that experiencing the self as holy--at the expense of being whole-- unjustly deprives the psyche of its completion.  He believes that every human being should be in touch with his Sadean side-- at least mentally-- for human potential not explored is what cripples the soul.  Just as there is no stick that has but one end, human potential and creativity must at least acknowledge, without necessarily favoring, the dark side of the psyche so that it's full complexity can be known and appreciated.  For Moore, as well as for de Sade, the perverse side of the personna that is forbidden to manifest itself mentally becomes the powerful driving force for enactment in the psycho-socially mal-adjusted person.  It is perhaps society's denial of our own dark eros that enrages and offends most when we see it demonstrated in others, for that denial surely perverts any attempt at self-knowledge, and forces the soul to assume a posture of balance and completeness that is false,lame, and ultimately unhealthy.  Moore hints that without personal aknowledgment of the darker depths of our psyches, as de Sade so blatantly illuminates, we cannot hope to soar to our greatest heights, for what we resist persists, and the chains of denial keep us tethered to terra firma instead of flying the limitless skies of our Divinity.  This book is not a quick read, nor is it for the judgmental or faint of heart.  It requires time, and a certain willingness examine our own depths, not favoring the dark, forbidden aspects of our psyche, but rather  admitting that a Sadean dark eros lies hale and hearty within us all, waiting to be revealed to honest introspection for spiritual growth through courage of heart.  +books

Three stories in one book.+P+THE CRANKY DAY is made up of three stories: Cranky Bugs, Put-Upon Percy, and Lady Hatt's Birthday Party. This inexpensive paperback is perfect for the Thomas fan. It has the colorful photographic "illustrations" that look like the series we're familiar with. This one is REALLY popular with my Thomas fans, and you can read the stories one at a time or all three at once. But beware -- when you're finished they're going to want you to read it again! and again! and again+books
Obvious ideas+N+I was forced to read this book because of a teacher of mine, for a topic at the university. She came to the classroom with this book, as if it were the ultimate guide on teaching. First of all, I thought it's not a topic for the kind of subject we were having/discussing in the classroom. Secondly, the things the authors wrote are so obvious, at least for some persons, that all I can say is that I really had a very good time reading it as a comic book, nothing else. I laughed very much with all the explanations a teacher would give to a 7 or 9 year-old pupil, because he touched her on the arm. It was a lecture, not a simple explanation! Clearly we have to be polite, encouraging and nice towards the students. But this book really exagerates some points in such a foolish way, that I could only laugh. I never had problems with students in my classes, I always tried to encourage them to like the subjects; I am sure they learned many things, as well as I learned from them, too. This book was just a waste of time. The worst thing is that the teacher I am talking about, the one who came to the classroom telling how wonderful the book is, doesn't practice what the book preaches! She is hated at the university and never behaves as the book says to. How is it possible? She didn't learn anything from it???  Maybe it's good for people who are starting a teaching career - then I would say read it, but even though I would be very cautious. But being recommended by someone who does exactly the contrary than the book states, I could imagine it wouldn't really be that good.+books

A True Fire From The Start...+P+"Shadowfires" was another wonderful book in the long line of great Koontz novels, and this one was no different.  We have the story of a woman named Rachel, and her husband, Eric Leben. Eric was a doctor in genetics who was fighting with his wife until he is pushed in front of a bus, by her, and killed. Rachel felt that maybe freedom was at last hers, until hours later, Eric is missing from the morgue, and we learn the awful truth of his secret work.   I felt that this book had action from the very first few pages, and did not stop until the very last word. I was thrilled with the roller coaster of a ride that Koontz took me on, and i could not put the book down once i started on the journey. Koontz makes great use of location, and our fears of within, to give us this great chiller of the experiments of man to be more than human. A definite gem in the Koontz collection, a must have for any collector, and a great place to start for anyone taking a look at his work for the first time. A Masterpiece. My only wish of this book: It should have been made into a movie. -C+books
Too much at once+N+I too had to purchase this book for a class. It did not help. There is too much information compacted into one paragraph. Then it is very reduntant. Each chapter seems to be repeating itself even though it is suppose to be on another subject of philosophy. I would not suggest this book to anyone. It was a good thing I had prior knowledge of philosophy so I could pass my class. If you know nothing of philosophy, this book will only confuse you more+books
El Bulli- Way too Hooey!+N+I was tremendously dissappointed with this purchase. This book has been produced with great care and quality. The photos are first rate, the cd is excellent however as a chef I must say that I strongly disagree with this aproach to food. It is different and wild and unlike anything you will see in the finest of restaurants. But, by taking the art of cuisine and food preparation and presentation into the science lab and creating flavor experiments we are losing the wonderful elegance and nuance of DINING!  For most Gastronomes this book and this food is a let down. David Leicht, Certified Executive Chef, American Academy of Chef'+books
When Jessie Came Across the Sea +P+This is a great historical fiction picture book.  The illustrator, P.J. Lynch did a marvelous job of creating the characters and scenes for every page.  Reading this out loud is a perfect way to teach about other countries and peoples.  This story would be a first glimpse for some children at immigrant history and what Ellis Island was all about.  With the help of the detailed illustrations, the past comes to life along with the emotional parting and reunions of loved ones. +books
Dead stall...+N+Warning spoilers...  In the worst installment of a bad series, Fitzchivalry wont die.  Perhaps the most interesting plot point of this whole contrived series is wasted entirely.  Fitz, who died, and rose again has his potentially interesting ordeal descrobed in perhaps the most boring way possible.  I supposed his dead body was infused with both wolf personality and human for a while (I guess souls mix when they are contained in a tiny brain), and of course the seizures.  Seizures trouble Fitz for a while, as long as they are convenient to the plot, and then, of course, they totally vanish.  While I found it really interesting that Fitz used to be dead, and the ramifications of that, we find that there are no ramifications whatsoever, except for a brief period of eliminate-the-wolf-behavior rehab.  I mean, he was reanimated after a period of time, but that's no big deal I guess.  Robin Hobb is such a good story teller, but she is horrible at plot.  Except in the Liveship traders series, but she must have written that one entirely differently, because you can't tell that this is the same author.  What she is good at is writing loveable characters, and slowly feeding you tidbits of knowledge about interesting things as the characters "learn" about them.  In other words she can "feed the fire" of the story well to keep interest.    But that doesn't mean she does it consistently, and this book is a great example of how even Hobb can utterly fail.  Robin relys solely on you LOVING the characters (which I feel she herself does) and she allows that to distract you from reasonable pacing.  This book starts out slow, then begins the ending phase of the master plot, and slowly slowly slowly panders through that and then ends in a rush.  Not to mention the fact that she knows nothing about plausibility.  This whole series is based on a character that is as loveable as your little brother, yet supposedly kills without compunction.  You know, an assassin.    This series asks people a simple question.  How would you describe an assassin?  Prior to reading this series you might say ruthless, cold, cruel, at best disaffected and callous.  Crafty certainly.  After reading this book, you would say, kind, affectionate, and loves dogs?  Add to that loyal to himself first, good natured, well liked, and an advisor to royalty?  So is Robin Hobb rethinking the role of an assassin?  No, you can't do that.  An assassin is an assassin.  You can't change that FACT.  No, she's creating a hero who was trained as an assassin, but who only functions as an assassin very very very few times at all, since that is a nasty business.  As kind and good natured as Fitz is, he never once questions the morality of killing someone because he was told in the weighty manner such a question deserves.  He never is actually put to any test.  So, Robin creates a hero, calls him an assassin, and swings the plot around to have him doing everying imaginable EXCEPT functioning as a cold-hearted killer.  He's a spy, a soldier, a telepathy partner, a wolf-buddy, and for some reason everyone just thinks he ought to be the hero.  When everything comes together, everyone just says Fitz, be the hero.  For no good reason at all (because you have telepathy does that make you the guy to go to?).  [...] Perhaps Robin thought the weirdness of the ending scenes would add a sort of tension, and of course, they were being persued, and so I guess that added drama.  But of course, the main threat, the "forged ones" were not really a threat anymore, but of course, you still have to resolve that issue, and was neatly done in the end.  But I felt the whole story, the drama of the "forged ones" really wasn't so dramatic, and I just don't get what caused them to behave just like they did.  On a fantasy scale, it was new, but not very interesting.  Robin does much better with dragons in the Liveship traders, and these dragons are just stupid.  And Verity-as-dragon is perhaps the dumbest of all.  Over all a slow build up for an overall letdown.  If I began Robin Hobb with this series, I would have never read her again.  I am forcing myself to finish the Tawny man series now, because I WANT to like her stuff.  But I don't know if I will EVER find enough time to finish that sleeper series.  Overall, try Ship of Magic, unless you are already invested in this, and have to have closure+books
Very Good Book+P+I used this book as a primary preparation tool for the Sun Certified Business Component Developer (SCBCD) exam. Being a beginner in EJB, I found this book to be very friendly. I liked the layout of the book in general and the writing style of the author in particular. Only relevant pieces of code are presented to focus explanation of topic in question. A complete running application may be downloaded from the author's website. The multiple choice questions at the end of every chapter and ALERTs in every chapter made remembering main points easier. Deployment descriptor elements are clarified in considerable detail and they are explained well. Please note that there are errors in this book - some of them are fairly obvious such as using a capital letter as opposed to a small letter (Java versus java) while others are not so obvious but noticeable by experienced java developers. Regardless of its minor faults, I consider this book to be a valuable addition to my library. Normally I would have a cut a star for the errors but because of its content quality, I felt compelled to give 5 stars. I just passed the exam today thanks to this book. I know that I will not hesitate to buy another book from this author. Thanks Mr.Sanghera! I recommend this book highly without any reservations whatsoever+books
A Darker Phineas Finn+P+In PHINEAS FINN, Anthony Trollope wrote about a happy-go-lucky young Irish Member of Parliament who romances the ladies and achieves a minor ministerial rank in the Liberal government. A dispute with his party regarding the Irish question, however, results in his leaving politics and returning to Ireland.  PHINEAS REDUX brings Phineas back, but the slogging is now harder. The vicious infighting between Daubeny (Disraeli) and Gresham (Gladstone) has soured Phineas somewhat. He is repeatedly slandered by a yellow journalist named Quintus Slide; and many in his party, including some of his friends, believe that the Irishman is carrying on an adulterous affair with Lady Laura Kennedy. At one point, the aggrieved husband takes a pot shot at Phineas, but misses. Matters turn still darker when J. Bonteen, a political rival to Phineas, is murdered one night in the street shortly after a quarrel with Phineas at the Universe Club.  The major set piece of PHINEAS REDUX is the trial of Phineas Finn for the murder of Bonteen. Opinion is evenly split on the question of his guilt and the issue seems to be in doubt until Mme Max Goesler, whose love Finn had rejected in the earlier volume, conducts her own investigation and produces evidence that turns the tide and results in a resounding acquittal.  If Trollope were a lesser author, everything at this point would be all sweetness and light. Here, however, Phineas suffers what appears to be a nervous breakdown and contemplates pulling out of politics altogether. What Trollope presents us with is an updated version of the Book of Job, with the difference that Phineas averts his face from his new good fortune and concentrates on his losses. His good friends rally round the young M.P. and slowly wean him from his depression.   The pot of gold at the end of this dark rainbow is Mme Max. Phineas proposes to the wealthy young widow and is accepted+books

"Streamers": a powerful glimpse at military life+P+"The Vietnam Plays, Volume Two," by David Rabe, contains two plays: "Streamers" and "The Orphan," together with a 1992 afterword by the author.  The book includes production information on both plays.  "Streamers" was produced and staged in 1976, and "The Orphan" was first produced professionally in 1973.  "Streamers" looks at a group of Army soldiers who are facing the possibility of being sent to Vietnam while the war is going on.  Rabe focuses on a group of three roommates, all junior soldiers.  As these troops talk and argue together with the other soldiers in the play, Rabe shows how tensions within the military can create fracture lines along many axes of difference: race, sexual orientation, educational background, rank.  Early on in the play Rabe introduces the theme of homosexuality in the army; this theme plays a significant role as the story unfolds.  Also explored is the relationship between younger troops and experienced combat veterans.  "Streamers" is a play that may seem a deceptively straightforward slice of military life, but I found it to be a dense and complex text, rich in irony, that rewards careful reading.  It's a powerful play that effectively presents a group of military personnel as a microcosmic world of tension, lust, anxiety, anger, and violence.  Particularly piercing is Rabe's look at the intersection of verbal "violence" and physical violence.  I found "The Orphan" far less interesting than its companion piece.  In it Rabe melds ancient Greek lore with late-20th century American concerns.  Although the play has some strong moments, overall I felt it lacked effectiveness.  I felt that Rabe missed a golden opportunity to really use the Trojan and Vietnam wars to shed light on each other.  Nevertheless, the presence of "Streamers" in this volume makes the book well worth owning, especially for those with an interest in the literature of war.  Recommended companion text for "Streamers": "A Sense of Honor," a novel by James Webb+books
Not what I expected+N+I think this book should have been entitled Over 60 and Gettin' Stronger. I'm 46 and I was really looking forward to getting this book in the mail. I think it is more geared to people over 60. Quite a few of the models were much older. I won't get a lot out of this book as far as exercises go. Quite a lot of the exercises weren't using dumbbells. You get the impression from the cover that the exercises will be heavily geared to using dumbbells but this isn't the case. I was disappointed with this book. I recommend Weight Training For Dummies which gives you excellent information and exercises to do. And also, Smart Girls Do Dumbbels by Judith Sherman-Wolin. That book is loaded with dumbbell exercise. +books

A Wierd Masterwork+P+A exquisite exotic, as terrible in beauty, and sweet in dreamworlds as any penned since Poe, very much it's shadow. Vance weaves a world as bejeweled in color and fantastique as readers could imagine, in a earth perched at the end of time, while the sun sputters its last gasp. Magic rules, and poor Cugel, its hero wanders from  the lilac-flavoured poisons of Mazirian's garden to the autumn-cut glass palaces of the Dying Earth. He is betrayed, bewitched, and perplexed by his environs, all to our joy, and such is his adventures that we hope for more, but it takes a genius such as Vance to realize it. Some say NIGHT LAMP is his last, but his readers, his children, will reimagine the lost lands of this book long after he is gone, perhaps to the end of this incredible, dream-haunted journey+books
What a disappointment!+N+This would never have been published as a first novel.  I had read and loved earlier books by Jeanne Dams and was looking forward to reading this book.  But the plot was almost nonexistent and the protagonist, young  Helda, unbelievable and not very likeable.  You had to do more than suspend  disbelief with this book, since everything about the book was so  improbable+books
Interview with the Vampire+P+I read this book when it first came out in paperback and have since read most of the others.  The reason for my recent purchase of the book was for a friend who enjoyed reading it and has since purchased Book 2.  All the Vampire Chronicle books I have read I have enjoyed and would recommend them to anyone interested in reading these types of books+books
we speak bow wow+P+Equipped with a keen intuition, great confidence, and credentials stacked sky high, Kate Solisti - Mattelon steps up and ably swats one home for the dog lover in us all. She has long understood that dogs run the wide and crooked. It's we humans who took the broad view and tried to fit it into the straight and narrow scope of understanding. An awkward fit at best, if not totally improbable. She presents her material simply, in a parable format of sorts to help us understand the heart and mind of man's best friend. Repeated readings pay off. Myself, having to resolve grief issues on having to put my thirteen years old Siberian Husky, Riva to sleep this past summer. I now know without doubt that my favorite life companion is a part of me forever. This book can and should be a part of you. Highly enjoyable. Highly recommended+books
Proceed with Caution+N+This book gives lots of chemical demonstration ideas.  However, some are entirely too dangerous to do.  You must use a lot of common sense when considering doing any of these demonstrations.  Some are not safe at all.  Mercury and CCl4 are EPA regulated.  It's not advisable to put ethanol in your mouth to spit out in front of students...  This only demonstrates bad lab techniques.  Make sure you do the first experiment in the book outside or in a fume hood.  It releases a strong odor and an acid vapor.  Definitely not something you want your students breathing+books
Great vocabulary builder!+P+My 4 yr old is special needs and we use this book as one of our activities. The book covers counting, colors, and SO much more. Things are color coded and stickers are seperated according to the section of the book they apply to. It allows for success even in children who would have a harder time. My son even tries to match the angle of the sticker with the colored shadow he is placing it on. It allows for a lot of practice with pragmatic speech. I can ask questions very easily, and he tries to answer based on what is in front of him. He gets very excited when he has finished a whole page. He attends very well with this book. I recommend it to everyone+books
Appreciative Intelligence+N+This book takes too long to get to the point and repeat it at least 20 times! The author should take a course in the art of writing educational books!+books
Inside looking out....+P+Since I am one of the characters involved I can truly say that Pete Earley captures the events more precise than those of us on the inside looking out. The chilling things he describes are true, and the scary part is they  are still happening, everyday. It is a must read for anyone truly  interested in how the justice system Really works+books
Eye opener!+P+I have been an Investment Counselor for over 40 years. This book makes more common sense than any book I have read on the subject. My main regret is that is wasn't around earlier. It is the key to Wealth and Security.+books
I can't believe someone published this.+N+6 volume series? he man could have easily compressed this into 400 pages, but he's so long winded with everything. And reading this feels like i'm standing at the front door with Jehova's Witnesses. Ender's game was great. It deserves 5 stars. But i'm almost convinced it was written by someone else+books
Great book, brings out the essense of vegitables.+P+Verdura is a great book which we have had for years now. Viana has a delightful cooking style which really focuses on the essense of vegitables... particularly fresh, in-season produce. Her recipes such as tomato and peach salad, or cucumber and orange opened our eyes to new combinations. One of our favorites+books
What  About "Nunning?"+N+I am not surprised Nugent doesn't mention what he once claimed was his favorite teenaged pastime, "nunning." In an interview for "Oui" magazine in the early 80's, Nugent was all too ready and willing to explain to the interviewer just what this "nunning" was.  As Nugent explained it:  He and a friend would drive around churches, convents, Catholic schools etc. with whichever one of them was on the passenger side having a large street map laid out on their lap. Underneath the map, Nugent and pal would have his zipper undone and his penis hanging out. When they would spot a young nun who looked naive enough, they would ask her through the halfway opened car window for directions to a certain street or road. As she would walk over, the jerk with the map would playact at being confused, looking dumbfounded at it. When the poor sister would reach into the car so she can get a better look at what Nugent and friend were having trouble, Nugent or friend would then quickly roll up the window thus trapping the now terrified nun. Then Nugent or friend would toss away the map waving their penis in the poor nun's face and fondle her chest.  This is the guy who has so much to say about morals, ethic and right living. This guy is a degenrate and his conservative Republican friends are all hypocrites when they have so much to say about "liberal celebrities" and never even acknowledge what this guy was so proud to brag about back in the 80's+books
Interesting but not the greatest +P+I remember reading this work years ago in connection with the study I was then making of American Jewish Literature. My impression was much that of another Amazon reader. It is at times a vivid account of a new immigrant experience, but the tale is not told with the deepest intensity of feeling. It may be unfair but the comparison which comes to mind is with Henry Roth's "Call it Sleep" which is a fictional work but one which goes deep into the soul and consciousness. This work is a more externally directed narrative, and has its virtue in giving a picture of one person's move to the New World+books
Trite dialogue, zero description+N+I thought this book was terrible.  I don't understand why people think this author is so amazing (unless they have really low IQ's).  Yes the subject matter was interesting but the delivery was very poor.  I showed it to a friend of mine and she said, "She writes like she learned to write from watching TV."  The novel is all dialogue and very little description, which doesn't equal up to an interesting read for me.  There was little suspense, I was not sympathetic to the main character, and the attempt at romance was a joke.  You want some real suspense in a mystery revolving around the legal system?  Go read Grisham+books
Berg at her best+P+Range of Motion was my third Elizabeth Berg novel (Talk Before Sleep and Until the Real Thing Comes Along being the other two) and I must say this is by far my favorite. I loved this book from the opening line to the finishing sentence. Berg portrayed her title character, Lainey, with great sympathy and passion for what she loved. I loved Lainey all the way through the book and she remains my favorite fiction character. Throughout the novel Lainey is dealing with her husband being in a coma after a freak accident along with taking care of her two daughters and helping her neighbor cope with a failing marriage. I cried along with Lainey and smiled at her happy moments the entire time keeping the faith that Lainey's husband would one day wake up along with her. For any fan of Berg or any reader interested in a truly great book, I highly recommend Range of Motion+books
Save your money!+N+All this information is on the internet or available from your doctor.  After many years of struggling with hip pain the water exercises are no surprise.  Nothing in the book is new.  I was very disappointed, if I could do the exercises listed, I wouldn't need the book.  Good luck to all of you, go to the local Y or swim therapy, put the money to good use for a good therapist, hips are not do it yourself+books
An idiotic or deliberately misleading book - take your pick+N+I read this book in order to see if it would change my opinion about the status of social security. It does not. In fact, it glosses over the key, overriding issue: that the so-called "social security trust fund" does not in fact exist. The claim that huge surpluses are being mounted is meaningless when all that really exists is an IOU that the government writes to itself.   The book spends all of one paragraph (see page 28) on this critical issue, suggesting that the reader imagine that the fund is invested in private stocks and bonds, rather than government bonds, and concluding, "It is difficult to see why the composition of the trust fund's portfolio should make any difference." I just about threw the book across the room at that point! In other words, the authors see no difference between a fund backed by real assets that can simply be sold and a fund that will require raising taxes or additional borrowing on an enormous scale+books

Is This Book Worth Your Time and Effort?+P+Yes it is!  As I sit here thinking about the experience of reading the book, and it is an experience I assure you,   I can tell you that there are slow periods in this "story" when you hope it will be "over soon".  So, don't expect an "easy read" on this one.  But the main idea is so "universal" and the story in its totality is so well written, that you forgive any "lapses into boredom" of the narrative.  In fact, that's partially what the book is about:  "small town boredom" of an intelligent and thoughtful and self examining lady in the early part of the 20th century. And, further, it's about the "will to overcome" and the  "courage to overcome" this boredom and pettiness of the small town by the main character who is a "downtrodden female" of that era.  I think this could be considered a "woman's lib" book.  As you read you will "cheer on" the main character, Carol, as she faces down the town pettitness and town bullies and even her somewhat staid but basically "good guy" husband.  The main thing that is bugging Carol is this:  She "hasn't found her true life's occupation" and she feels "trapped" in the little podunk town of Gopher Prairie and in her marriage so that she'll never "find her true self". (wow, what a name for a town!o)   This theme is a universal theme because everyone, even men, have the same driving force of finding "who am I" and "where do I really belong."   It's a "universal theme".  Thus this is an "important book" to read if you have ever had similer thoughts and restiveness about "where do I belong" and "what is my true purpose in life."   Just keep reading past the "slow parts" and you'll find that your effort will be rewarded.  Email boland7214@aol.c+books
From a skeptic+P+For a Navy guy like me to admit that I read a selp help book is hard enough, but to share how much I loved it with millions of people I think is even harder!  My wife forced me to start reading this book "Relationships: Gifts of the Spirit" but after about ten pages she couldn't have taken it away from me if she tried.  I started with Chapter eight because it was the chapter on "war".  I was expecting the normal war stuff, but instead I got a lesson in something much more important.  I have started to learn how to listen to my body through pain and sickness.  I never thought back and neck pain were anything more that a nuisance, but the author tells me in her book that they are messages.  Maybe that five mile run was too much, maybe fighting with my wife or avoiding phone calls from my mother was not the best course of action and the only way my body knew to tell me was to make me feel pain. I have since recommended this book to all of the guys!  It's not what you expect from a book about relationships+books
A most amusing memoir+P+Content aside, whether or not you are interested in the Nixon administration, this is a wondeful memoir written in a very readable yet elegant style.  I suspect that Safire had the Earl of Clarendon leaning over his shoulder when he wrote this.    It's full of wonderful character studies of the major and minor players in the administration.  Safire is not enitirely candid in what he writes and he does pull his punches, but if you are good at reading between the lines, it's all there.   A very enjoyable read.  Each chapter focuses on a person or key event during the years.  Watergate is covered but only tangentally+books
these reviewers blindly regirgitate antiscience gibberish+N+This book is garbage. Tell me of one documented case of human ill-effects from GMO's and maybe I will sway. Recently the Zambian gov't turned down 18000 tons of emergency grain from the US because it was GM. People died of starvation as a result. At least take the time to get the other side of the story before taking this book as the gospel truth. I respect Nader for alot of the things he has done. This book is certainly not on that list+books
It's not what you think+N+Wells is a wonderful writer, it is true; however, his bigotry and hatred of certain peoples and of religion is very apparent. His political leanings are also too apparent--it is not an unbiased book and may give some the wrong impression of world events. I am currently reading the book updated just after WWII+books
People will believe anything it seems+N+Okay, maybe I am greatly missing something, and someone can inform me of where they are, but I couldn't find most the guys sources.  There were numbers beside certain facts, but I looked into the back of the book, and everything, and found NO connection with the numbers listing where the fact originated.  I went to the index, and what was listed as recources, but they had NO connection with the numbers which were listed besides the facts in which he put forth.  When I read a book which is suppose to expose new information to me, I would expect there to be an extensive list of sources so that I can look up the information and the people in which he obtained the information from.  What I found in the resources section were links to papers I should read which all contain biased info which were mainly on why you should eat Vegan.  I don't deny that the guy truly believes what he is doing is right, and that he is truly trying to help people, but the fact that I can't find sources bothers me.  Anyways, this guy talks about how great it will be to live long -- personally, I could give a crap....last thing I want to be is freaking 50yrs old, but that is just my opinion.  I don't get what the point of him writing numbers beside facts was if he isn't going to back those numbers up with source information.  Read at your own risk.  There is always the chance that I obtained a copy which left out this information, or that I am just missing it, but until I see a source list on his information, and am able to see completely the studies he includes, which talk about people living longer, being healthier, etc, then I can't fully believe him+books
A bit childish....+N+I am 16 and in love with all Arthurian literature. As I was reading Nancy Springer's "I Am Morgan Le Fay", I got extremely bored. It was so juvenile. Her relationship with Thomas was just odd. It completely destroyed the legend. If you really, and I mean really want to read a great book about Arthurian literature, I can recommend some for you. Obviously, Marion Zimmer Bradley's masterpiece, "The Mists of Avalon" is one of them. Here are some others. **Queen of Camelot ~ Nancy Mckenzie **the Guinevere series ~ Persia Woolley **yet another Guinevere series ~ Sharan Newman **In Camelot's Shadow ~ Sarah Zettel **For Camelot's Honor ~ Sarah Zettel **Prince of Dreams ~ Nancy Mckenzie **Grail Prince ~ Nancy Mckenzie **Sword of the Rightful King ~ Jane Yolen **The Romance of Tristan ~ Beroul **The Firebrand ~ Debra A.

Best drug handbook on the market!+P+I've had every edition of this drug handbook for about 10 years now, and I use it often.  I've seen lots of "other" veterinary drug handbooks, but they pale in comparison to Plumb's.  There's just the right amount of information here--not too much, not too little.  Other handbooks seem relatively lacking in content+books
Very interesting+P+This has lots of background and biographical information.  Plus it includes other materials.  Well done. I was a little disappointed in the quality of the paper.+books
Finally read this cult favorite: YEAH!  +P+What a magical book!  The Mellon family inherits The Pink Motel on the Florida coast and moves down for the summer to run it.  There they meet an assortment of regular guests and find some new ones.  The children, Kirby and Bitsy, make friends with a local boy named Big and revive a bored girl guest named Sandra.  Secrets, mysteries, alligator chasing, coconuts, wonderful treats from Miss Frith's basket, and some very, very valuable dog guests make for a lively and engaging story.  For 1951, the integration between white and black children is natural and straightforward.  This is the kind of book I would like to write.  I sure enjoyed reading it. +books

Enuff Already!!! End the Agony & GET ON With It!+N+This once promising and enjoyable series (and I have read every book) has just become too much like an overblown TV soap opera. Every time one problem or mystery seems to be cleared up, it either evolves into something else or another situation takes it's place and we have to wait a year or more for the next episode. Temple appears to have finally made a choice between the two M's but we all know that's only a deception. The one bright spot in the story (and earlier books had a whole lot more of them) is on page 297 and involves the wonderful Fontana Brothers doing a James Bond imitation. It took me forever to read this book and made me think it would be my last Midnight Louie story until the end. And I must say it's a shocker and I will have to read the next installment but get a headache thinking things will drag out til the author reaches "Z"+books
An excellent compendium or giftbook especially for thoughtful football fans+P+Edited by Sports Illustrated magazine's executive editor Rob Fleder, and with an introduction by popular football writer Peter King, Sports Illustrated: Great Football Writing compiles classic stories about football and football players from the pages of the venerable magazine, from the modern day to the 1950's. From "The Nightmare of Steroids" to "Where Have You Gone, Joe Namath?" to "All the Way with O.J." - an article about Simpson's stellar football performance from long before his arrest and trial for murder - the articles cover the both the highlights and the low points of America's long love affair with football. An excellent compendium or giftbook especially for thoughtful football fans, who enjoy pondering at length how the sport and its telling has gradually evolved with the decades+books
Koontz was hyped as King's sole competition for so long...+N+But I don't understand why after reading this book.  I saw flashes of Koontz as a contender with this story, but in the end the book limped along on half-drawn characters and stilted dialogue.  Koontz came up with a grand slam premise, and it was the strength of the premise that dragged me across the finish line.  Without that I'm not so sure I would've made it.    The characters aren't all badly drawn, but none of them really feel complete.  The dialogue is at times atrocious, at others simply frigid.  As a case in point, I have not forgotten--nor will I ever forget--the preposterousness with which one of the characters described the monster in detail AS HE'S BEING EATEN.  I almost took off my running shoes at that point.  Almost.    Koontz can write well when he puts his mind to it.  But Phantoms proves too stiff and underdeveloped to truly showcase his talent.  Pick up Intensity instead+books
Solid Book but a supplement not subsitute+P+This is the best book on boxing I've encountered. The author does a good job of explaining technique and providing drills for exercise. However, ANY book on boxing will be inadequate for learning how to box. Good boxing skills can't be learned from a book - just the way you can't learn to dance well from a book. To physically know how to box you need a trainer and you need to get in the ring and spar. To master the techniques, it must feel right. You acquire that feeling by watching your trainer and having him/her correct your mistakes. You have to be physically next to that person (Anyone who's learned to box or dance will tell you this is true). You polish those techniques and gain confidence in using them through sparing. Yet the author does deserve credit for putting out a fine book+books
A Color of his Own+P+A Color of his Own is a delightful book, not only for young children but for adults as well. The little chameleon notices that all the other animals have their own color, but he changes colors depending on his enviroment.  He struggles with wanting to be like everybody else and he eventually finds a friend (another chameleon) to be his buddy and go everywhere with him.  The colors of the illustrations are vibrant and the text is engaging to the reader. A joy to read+books
I can't believe some of yall.....+P+Genevieve (jenny-v) is a damn good read, and I can't believe some of you all are rating it 2 to 3 stars.  Everyone has an opinion, so that's why I beg to differ.  This book kept me on the edge with its home-town drama.  I would occasionally rub the old lady's leg when I got to those good parts.  I became so wrapped up into this dialogue, I could hear the voices, smell the cigarettes, touch... well, that was the old lady.  I loved it.  Mr. Dickey is a great writer and I plan to buy every book that he writes in the future.  Unless he starts to get flakey and starts writing about aliens.  That's my two cents+books
A Good Read+P+Once again one of my favotite authors has written a novel about the South that gives me a vivid and exciting glimpse of how things were in another era. Her heroine is a woman with a mind of her own who doesn't mind taking the bitter with the sweet to be with the one she loves. I reccomend this highly+books
A simple introduction to a complex man.+P+There is no better way to get into the mindset of Fellini than through his own words. This unassuming book is full of the director's  thoughts and motivations. From behind the scene anectdotes to descriptions of scenes  never filmed this is an excellent place to start learning about the movie  world's best director ever+books
Dr..... WHY????+N+I came upon this book by random chance, and was mislead to believe that this was a piece of true literature.  A book (short story really) that stumbles towards nothing.  If you're looking for some popcorn reading, sure this might suite you just fine, but avoid like that plague otherwise.  I suggest picking up some Vonnegut or Yates.  I hope this review might save at least one of you!!!    PS:  avoid frustratingly pointless epilogue.. +books
Highly Recomend+P+Transforming a Rape Culture, by Milkweed Editions is a book that has input from thirty-seven active feminists; twenty-five women and twelve men, who all play different roles in life. Their occupations range from book and article writers, to psychologists, speakers, teachers, parents, and more. Having many authors, instead of just one, gives this book an advantage over one author's opinion. It was definitely written to spark an emotion in everybody to make change. The book's topic effects and influences everybody in some way in life to make a change, even if it's just within themselves. It succeeded in doing so. The book analyzes the factors in our culture, which promote and support not only rape, but also sexual assault, and harassment. It also presents ideas and methods to end it. All the sections throughout this book are linked nicely together giving it a strong analytical flow from all the authors - all seeking nothing less than a fundamental culture change with a method achieve it through the change of power, gender, race, and religion+books

Great primer on practical utilization of your intuition+P+Ms. Peirce has written a well organized approach to seeing your intution as a valuable tool, not just a once-in-a-while whimsy. A trained intuitive herself, Penney Peirce is full of encouragement as well as clearly laid out exercises to allow one to hone their intuitive skills and incorporate the benefits into daily life. I would recommend this book to those embarking on their first inward journey (no matter at what age!). There are abundant benefits to the practice she outlines in this honest and heart-felt presentation. Again, asking that question of mastery: How do you get to Carnegie Hall? Practice+books
Disappointed+N+I am a huge fan of the first Quilts from the Quiltmaker's Gift publication.  I loved the book and have made three quilts that were inspired from the patterns found there.  This sequel, More Quilts from the Quiltmaker's Gift is inferior on nearly every level.  The patterns are not so interesting, and seem more fussy and complex.  In addition, in this sequel publication, the patterns are not rated by level of difficulty, which I believe is a detriment.  Finally, the actual quality of the book is not good.   Within a day of bringing it home from the store, the cover of the book had curled up like a wood shaving!   I think the authors would have done well to stick with the same publisher who put out their first effort.  About the only good things I can say about the book is that the instructions seem clear and the photos of other color options are helpful+books
Defectuve Book+N+The Index in the back of this book is incorrect.  The author and publisher are aware of this...I contacted each and they confirmed this.  Thus this book is worthless for anyone who wants to look things up....it should be taken off the market and corrected+books
Disappointed. No useful advice.+N+I bought this book for myself, expecting to find some useful advice to help me organize my day a little better and to stay focused on priorities. I have been in management for 12 years and I expected this book to offer some new insights into time management and other daily challenges. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed and struggled to find some useful advice within the first half and have since put it down.   The book seems to target a junior audience with a certain type of personality that is more focused on fitting in and accommodating others, rather than those focused on leadership and results.   The book itself feels really cheap. I is printed on that cheap news-print paper like those crossword puzzle books.   +books
Save your money+N+This book was a total waste of money for me.  The UK English is nearly impossible to decipher at times.  It is very difficult reading.  This mihgt be a good book for experts but is worthless to the beginner.  The author describes repair in detail, but assumes the reader knows all the technical terms being used without explaining them.  The drawings are difficult to decipher.  Photos would have been better.  If you are a beginner looking for a good book to get started in clock repair, this isn't it+books
A Wonderful Book for Advanced ESL Students.+P+I borrowed a copy of its second edition a few days ago and have just finish it.  I just love this book. I wish that I would have a chance to read this book a few years ago.  +books
Mostly Useless+N+The series started off so well, it's sad to see it end so badly. This book is just a collection of random events, there really isn't a plot. None of the questions raised throughout the series are answered.  The first book was great, I wish I had stopped there.+books
A Ride on the Descending Road of Modern History+P+`Singapore Grip' recreates the world of pre-WWII Singapore. Farrell centers his tale around the Blackett and Webb conglomerate based on rubber plantations, but extends to wide-ranging export-import business. Singapore was created to be a trading center for the British Empire and it succeeded beyond any reasonable expectations.   As war edges closer the air of unreality gets thicker. Even when the Japanese attack Malaya in late 1941, these people just don't get it. Singapore Grip explores this world in detail and from many different perspectives. The higher in the colonial hierarchy, the harder it is for reality to penetrate. Walter Blackett, scion and head delusionist is still planning the company's 50th Jubilee while the Japanese are bombing the island and even Singapore town proper.   `Singapore Grip' is a vignette in what Huxley called "the descending road of modern history". The war gathers slowly, life begins to change, but not dramatically at first. But, the vise inexorably tightens and the world of the characters crumbles under the relentless pressure. Escape from the island seems at first an absurd idea, but it gradually becomes ever more desirable until it finally becomes impossible in the crush at the quays.   If you are tempted to turn away from this book, don't. `Singapore Grip' gathers force and clarity as Farrell slowly adds the pieces to his masterful mosaic and the reader is duly rewarded. The book has been recently reprinted in the excellent New York Review of Books Classics series. Highly recommended. +books
and I always thought dummies books were for complete beginners...+N+Caveat emptor to the absolute beginner. This book is not written for the beginning web page creator. It is not written in a tutorial style. It is good as a reference source as you study a true tutorial type book. It discusses tags and their attributes one at a time without showing you how they fit into your web page code. The beginning chapters throw lots of advanced features at you and tell you they will be discussed in chapter 19 etc. I was completely overwhelmed after 20 min of reading. So what's a beginner to do? I recommend Create Your First Web Page in a Weekend. By the time you get half way through that book then you can use this dummies book as a reference. william+books
....hmmm....what a great book!+P+I love this book! Early teens and older should read this book. Learn what it means to love and to sacrifice.+books
McPhee is amazing+P+McPhee joins a merchant marine as he tries to find a ship to work on -  hence the title - then journeys with him as the boat does its work. I  picked this book up because I've read other books by McPhee that make  subjects that I would normally not even think about fascinating. This book  was no exception. For readers who have read his geology series (compiled  into Anals of the Former World) and found it a bit too technical and dry,  this book will be a refreshing change. I never would have thought I'd be  interested in this subject, but McPhee made it interesting+books
a disappointment+N+I have been greatly been disappointed in this book. I am a total Francophile and soak up just about any book on life in southern France, be it travelogue, novel, cultural study, etc. I have been reading Map of Another Town over the past few months and it's been a struggle. MFK Fisher goes into painfully boring and unnecessary detail on the most insignificant things, like having to go back and forth between offices and buildings while seeking the appropriate vaccinations for a trip to Africa, and what she thinks of every little thing related to the process. She'll devote pages and pages to experiences that have nothing to do with live in Aix-en-Provence and its environs -- it's a map of her own head, where she spends too much time. She finds herself rather fascinating, but I found her self-centered.   I thought it would be interesting to read about life there in the 1950s and 1960s, but again, the book is less a cultural study than autobiographical ramblings (if you can find it, Village in the Vaucluse, a Laurence Wylie cultural study first written in 1957 and updated in 1967 and 1974, is fascinating and was one of my college texts for a French culture course -- 5 stars plus.). I probably will not even bother with A Considerable Town and will finish Map of Another Town only because I feel like I should.  If you are considering this book because life in southern France fascinates you, I would instead recommend any of the Peter Mayle books (not jumping on the bandwagon here; I've read his books from the beginning and own all of them, and his writing style is absolutely delightful and endearing, even when he's being a snob), Yvone Lenard, etc. In fact, Peter Mayle's books so charmingly describe Provence that they serve as a guidebook to the best the region has to offer, so you can visualize and plan your own trip. With his writing style, it feels like you're along for the trip, whereas with MFK Fisher, you wonder when you're going to get there.+books
Excellent answer to the question of the Gospels' genre+P+I have heard claims that the Gospels are "metaphor" or that they were never meant to be taken as biographical (and therefore don't have much or any historical data).  This book ably debunks such claims.  The intent of this book is not to prove the historicity of Gospels, but to prove their genre.  By establishing their genre, then we can better understand the intent of the authors.  The well reasoned conclusion in Burridge's book is: the Gospels fit the ancient genre of biography.  In doing so he discusses a lot about genre and analysis (this section was a bit tedious for me, but it was thorough).  In all of the discussion and examples we learn how the ancient biographies are much different from modern ones.  This is a key point, because I think much of the debates and criticisms of the gospels are done from the perspective of a modern biographical viewpoint.  The ancients wrote biographies differently than those that are written today.  But this does not make them more or less true.  It is a matter of emphasis.  Today we want to know the details about dates, eye color, and a year by year accounting of events.  The ancients were more selective in their biographies, and often focused on character not a chronological "play by play" of a person's life.  The ancient biographers did not just write to catalogue facts about a person, they often wrote to demonstrate why or why not we should emulate their subject.  Moderns too have such motives, and even biases, but they are often less up front about them.  In many ways the ancients are superior in this regard, because it makes it easier to distinguish between data and commentary.  In the end, Burridge gives several examples of biography from the ancient world, and demonstrates that the Gospels very clearly match their pattern.  Though there is variety between each of the biographies and the Gospels, they are clearly demonstrated to be part of the same family of literature.  This then establishes how the Gospel writers understood their own works to be - biographies of Jesus+books
More than just a biography of Tiger Flowers+P+I found this book interesting not only for its overview of the life and career of Tiger Flowers but for the broader look at how athletes, especially black athletes, had to cope with the pressure of the public eye in the South in the early 20th century+books
Are You Easily Amused?+N+If you're easily amused by anything that hyperactively draws attention to its &quot;cool&quot; sensibility, this book is for you. Stacey Richter obviously went to one too many writer's workshops where they pat each other on the back for their inside-ness and forget what real literature can be. None of her characters reveal any depth or texture. What little thematic substance the stories have is as fuzzy as a fly-away wisp of pink cotton candy. Instead, what you get is exaggerated, absurd sequences rooted in cultural fetishes and fantasies of abnormality or violence. Richter lacks the discipline or patience to build a real-life scenario; she wants to take shortcuts by way of cultural references, precious oddity, and patronizing first-person narration. Incidents tumble forward like an upturned toychest of kitschy knick-knacks collected and lovingly polished, then laid out on a tacky folding table for you to fawn over and call art. The word that best describes the whole thing is &quot;shallow.&quot; It's as if Richter were writing moment-to-moment, giggling over her cleverness, probably sipping an Orbitz because it's &quot;so stupid, it's sublime.&quot; After smart people start seeing through this one-trick literary con job (I'm looking down at my watch), perhaps Richter can get lucky and land a gig writing pop-up windows for Blind Date+books
narrow mindness or just stupidity???+N+I want to respond to this book and all voices given. Some said that it points out how Turks eliminated Greek etc. in the 15th century from Asia. Well, if it should get historical, people would know that Turks already started to settle down in Asia around 10th- to 11th century. The population was getting crowded with Turks than (old) Greeks. Fights have been fought Byzants against the Selcuks. The Byzantiniens didn't like the way Asia was getting more and more full with Turks. Wars have been fought, Byzans lost the war, Ottoman Empire succeeded, easy so far I hope to follow. Coming to the situation at 20th Century, the so called "holocaust" at Greeks and Armenians. Everybody knows that Britain used the Greeks and Armenians to get access to Iraq, which didnt exist as a country at that time, because of oil which most of you should know. Greeks and Armenians were used so British could get more access to Iraq and other nations with a lot of oil, like Kuwait etc.  So, Greeks started to rebell and Armenians, too. Thousands of Turks were killed in West and East-Asia. The answer for ongoing slaughters on the Turkish population was to relocate the Armenians, at East Asia, who made troubles and Greeks, at West Asia. BUT, no body could know who were the trouble makers, so it was decided that the whole population has to move away if Turkey wanted to claim those lands. Greeks did the same at these day Greek teritory, Northeast Greece. Northeast Greece was populated mostly with Turks, but they "had" to move because of the killing Greeks did on the Turkish population there, so Turkish and Greekish gov't decided to move their populations. Greek got their populations back from West-Asia, safely, and Turks their own from Ottoman lands (nowadays, Northeast Greece). OH, did I forget to point out that it was "normal" for nations to move away populations of the 'other' kind because of the problem, if more people of another kind live there they were able to claim it. So, even Greece and other nations did this THING, it was normal to do at those times. So to point out, it is biased, this book. Turks did their best in relocating the whole Armenians but didn't have enough supplies, which ended in couple of thousand of deaths which is still nothing compared to the deaths of the Turks. Yes, it was a tragedy, but every nation has one, even the Turks. The holocaust at Cyprus in the 1900's-1970's at the Turkish population. The unaccounted numbers of violations against humanity against Turks at Bulgaria (19th-20th century), Greece(until the 1980's and 90's), Russia (19th-21st century), Cyprus (19th century-1970's), and West-China(until these days). People should be more aware of history, and reading this book it was said to see how biased people are against people like my nation, people, and myself. Armenians living in Turkey have no troubles, I ask myself, why? Freedom of religion was always granted in Turkey. Even these days the Greek gov't doesn't allow a mosque in Athen, I ask myself why? There are orthodox-churches in Turkey. Hatred causes blindness! Keep an open mind and read a good book which tells the truth story. A.K+books
Worth catching as it falls into book stores+P+&quot;'Introduction to Fall Protection' by J. Nigel Ellis, is a  masterpiece in the art and practices for fall protection.

Change, Partenrships and Transformation+P+Those of us in the change and transition business are vocal, loud and some would say, obnoxious advocates for recognizing the human side and impact of change.  Too often our words fall on deaf ears...with &quot;True Partnerships&quot; we finally have a text that deals with NEW principles for relating to others during, before and after change.  We finally have a text that deals with the potential destructiveness of autonomy, power, scarcity mentality and victimhood.  Instead this book awakens a call to action for relationships that produce extraordinary results by shifting our philosophy to one of connection, communication, expansion and creator/observer.  It is powerful, beyond words and is guaranteed to cause you to examine your own approach of &quot;drift&quot; versus &quot;true partnership.&quot;  It can shake you up and transform your relationships at work, at home and everywhere inbetween.  Read it and begin relating differently today+books
Not near what I thought it would be+N+I was taken aback by how convoluted and overreaching this text was. I guess I expected more. I found myself having to read and reread certain paragraphs and sections of this book just to understand what Telford was attempting to say. I found his open hostility toward the traditional position of inerrancy troubling. One reviewer says that Work "shows how the paradigm of inerrancy is fatally flawed." He shows no such thing. He approaches the discussion and falls flat in his efforts. One way to make your point it to denigrate your opponent. This he did do. He seemed to imply that all who believe in inerrancy are lowbrow fundamentalists. Ultimately, Work's overhaul (i.e., paradigm shift) for viewing the Word of God was simply over the top and without warrant. I note that this book came out in November 2001, but I have yet to see Bible colleges and seminaries adopting Work's new paradigm and dialect, and with a sales ranking of 711,096, his book is likely not going to usher in his "new paradigm.+books
Inconsistent - some greatness amongst some disjointed tedium+N+I got this for Christmas and finished it late last night.   As the tale begins, the author initiates two primary storylines, The first is set in WWII spanning both the European and Pacific theatres. The second is modern day and is centered on a California start-up (with requisite ambitious young guys) with primary business interests in the far east. One knows the stories are connected because of similar last names in both. The other connection is encryption - how crytography was central to the war and how it is central to current day business and, in the author's view, central to the future of civilization.  One of the great pluses of the book is how the author made use of these commonalities between WW2 and modern-day to create interest and anticipation. The middle of the book actually made use of these quite well and I was eager to keep reading. There is some terrific writing in middle sections and descriptions of people and places both in Europe and the Far East are very vivid.  The author does write with terrific humour at times and I was reminded in several places about a series of books written about WWI called "The Bandy Papers - the Journals of Bartholomew Bandy" by Donald Jack. Very similar in style as the author captures the points of view - dry wit - of Grandpa (WW2) and grandson (techno geek) Waterhouse.  The presentation of Gen. Douglas McArthur was (from my Canadian perpective) endearingly flag-waving-pipe-chomping-bullet- shedding-American-Super-hero and, of course, totally unbelievable.  Then I hit the final pages where I had hoped to receive a big-payoff to the build-up over the previous thousand pages. Alas, it was not to be and all the tedious verbiage that scarred the entire book turned out to be a sad bell-weather.  One of the "1 star" reviews amongst these reviews suggested that Tolkien was nothing compared to Neal Stephenson as far as filling up pages with words. There are numerous examples of page after page of "who cares" blathering which may tell us that some of the characters are in fact terribly boring individuals but do not deepen the characterizations. One of the good points is that when you hit such a section - and the reader will recognize them - you can simply skip about 5 pages or more and pick up the story without missing anything. The book could have been shortened by about 400 pages, maybe more. I'm guessing there is an encrypted message in the pages somewhere but I couldn't care less.  Some story lines, characters and inferences are left totally unresolved in the end (e.g. what happened to the dentist?). A case of author boredom and a loss of interest as the ending approached? And why the heck did Andrew Loeb make a final appearance! Talk about out-of-place and just bizarre.  I dunno what the author is thinking sometimes but several times he comes across as just a tad too clever. At least 3 times during the book (inluding the opening pages) I didn't have a clue what he was talking about. For example, one such bit of cleverness is his incorporation of the Hindenberg disaster in New Jersey - the narrative is written at that point from the perspective of a main character who stumbles literally out of the woods after seeing a brightness in the sky. It is not central or even obliquely of interest to the story line. The author never mentions Hindenberg by name and it is left to the reader (if you can pass the author's ever-so-clever test of cleverness) to figure it out. It seemed somewhat a condescending (to the reader) writing style.  There is the usual technology-dropping (like dropping names but gadgets instead of people) to presumably up the coolness factor and from my knowledge it is mostly, but not always, believable.  Ultimately, why there is some terrific writing, the overall result is a draft that needs 1 or 2 more rewrites and a worthy ending to really tell a terrific story.   Summary - go directly to Tom Clancy's books which are executed much better and have endings that offer a consistent pay-off (but with less humour). Clancy can also go on and on... but not like this guy!  The paperback story is 1130 pages of small type that is hard to read+books

A Landmark Book on Family Businesses!+P+Ivan Lansberg's new book is an excellent resource for anyone living through, or helping to manage, the succession process in a family business!

Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle, Mrs. Grassfeather, Mrs. Ragbag...Where does it end?+P+This book is great.  If you ever have a problem with your child's behavior, Mrs. Piggle Wiggle is the one to call.  Her outrageous solutions to common child behavior ailments seem to work well.  In most cases she recommends letting the child wallow in his or her own awful behavior until rock bottom is reached.  Only then is the child aware of the real-life consequences for bad behavior.  A perfect book for teaching personal responsibility.  Not to mention it's filled with fun names like Mrs. Moohead, Mrs. Broomrack, and Mrs. Crankminor.  My only complaint is Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle herself is present for only a very small percentage of the book, and the book ends without even going back to her.  I was thinking (and hoping) she'd be on every page.  This goes to show you, Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle, who loves kids more than anybody, still lets them bring on their own suffering when it comes to correcting a major attitude problem.  If a kid doesn't want to eat...shoot, let the kid starve.  If the kid doesn't want to pick up toys, then let the kid get trapped in clutter.  Show kids what it's like to have to clean up their own mess instead of cleaning up their mess for them all the time.  (This doesn't apply to diaper changes of course.)  In addition to the elaborate Piggle-Wiggle cures, the kids in the book get a spanking from their parents every now and then, especially after playing around with the laundry chute.  Sorry kids, can't do that+books
zen keys is lifechanging+P+i had always had a semi-interest in buddhism, derived from ecstatic readings of 'dharma bums' by jack kerouac (another must-have), but disappointed as i couldnt find 'big sur' at the bookstore a month ago, i chanced upon the religion section, and zen keys shone out on the shelf, i picked it up, read a page of thich nhat hanh's contemplative prose, and immmediately bought and took it home devouring it in my bedroom for hours. Nhat Hanhs compassionate and understanding approach to Zen Buddhism makes learning about it easy, and also very rewarding. his take, which is no ones take at all but rather the truth, about zen makes for free-minded thinking thru the eight negations, mindfullness of everyday life, and the wisdom of the zen masters in the kung-ans at the end of the book. i cannot help but be forever changed by this simplistic yet beautiful overlay of Zen Buddhism. anyone, everyone, Americans and materialism and all, MUST read this, dont lose your life in forgetfullness and apathy and be lost in worldly pursuit, be a monk+books
Here we go again.+N+You almost feel sorry for the author.  Draped in acclaim, among the books of the year, it can only mean that any reader approaches this book with high expectations.  More worrying, the author's information on the back of the book talks mosly about all the prizes he won at Harvard.  And that's what the book feels like, a very well executed assignment.  It's written in a fairly convincing pidgin English, but when it wavers, it breaks the rhythm and the belief.  It also feels entirely formulaic.  It goes through the trials of dehumanisation (murder, rape, sodomy etc) but it never engages the reader's sympathy, just occasional admiration.  There's no doubt that Iweala can write.  I hope he dares to produce something fresh that doesn't feel borrowed from another culture, another life.  I'd risk buying another book of his+books
Mystery Novel about Washington Intelligence+P+This 1974 novel used sources like "The Politics of Heroin in Southeast Asia" by Alfred W. McCoy, and the others listed in the 'Preface'. It takes place in Washington DC. Ronald Malcolm works for the "American Literary Historical Society", and reads detective and mystery novels to summarize its plots for his employer. One day their new accountant tells Malcolm there is a discrepancy in the records; of seven crates shipped from Seattle only five crates arrived in Washington. This had not been noticed previously. The accountant reports this loss in a memo.  Malcolm reports to work on Thursday. It is his turn to go out for sandwiches for lunch, and he uses a basement exit for a short-cut. He also runs an errand. He returns to find the front door locked; he has to use his key. Then he finds that all of his co-workers have been killed by professional assassins. Malcolm leaves the building and calls the "panic number" from a public phone to report the maximum damage; he is told to disappear and call back later. When Malcolm calls back, he is told to make contact in an alley of a Georgetown theater. But his rescue team takes a shot at Malcolm, who fires back, escapes, and goes to ground. Will Malcolm be rescued by he CIA or found by the killers? And who is the double agent?  After you read this novel you can better understand the film, which is a simplified and condensed version (called "Three Days ...). The story was changed from drug smuggling (to censor drug references?), and relocated to NY city. This story seems implausible to me, since eliminating the one link in Seattle would avoid the furious investigation that would follow a massacre of seven in Washington DC.+books
*Those  Mesmerizing  Eyes  &  A  Special  Easter  Egg*+P+How could I have missed HUNWICK until now? He is a rabbit-eared Bandicoot, one of an endangered species, familiarly known in Australia as the BILBY. *Aussie* reviewer "LIN" won me over by suggesting that "Hunwick's Egg" would be a great Easter gift. Hunwick and his mysterious egg become very special friends but the egg does not hatch.   They are scrutinized by a collection of the weirdest animals you ever yearned to hug: a cockatoo, an  echidna (resembling a porcupine), and the hairiest of emus who could benefit from a bit of *Bryll Cream* . . . Hunwick is all heart and reaches out to readers with the most irresistible eyes to ever appear on your radar screen! But still the egg does not hatch. The plant life is gorgeous, drawn ever so delicately in watercolor pencils. I am most captivated by a plant resembling the eucalyptus, and other green wildflowers.  After referring to my dictionary I felt tricked into falling for a RAT, of all things. I don't want to believe what my faithful reference says about this darling creature!  The more important reality is that HAPPINESS CAN ERUPT FROM THE MOST UNEXPECTED OF RELATIONSHIPS. It is remarkable how loneliness vanishes when you can share your burrow. Reviewer mcHAIKU recommends that you make sure you have an Easter Basket large enough to accommodate this precious book+books
Hunwick's Egg+P+A wonderful story of devotion! Mem Fox continues to be one of my favorite children's story tellers. Hunwick is a sweet little creature who remains loyal in spite of others' misgivings. The use of so many animals strange to the Americas makes the book even more wonderful, with delightful pictures to help with the story+books
Far, Far Superior to Guyton, in my opinion. +P+Both Guyton texts I received were manufactured defectively, coming unglued along the strap of the spine. Poor job, Saunders. Typical. Vander's Human Physiology is an excellent textbook in the sense that it answers all of the right questions at the right time, while you are studying. Also, more chemistry in Vander's, and in the long run that was important to me, since the atom is the basis of everything. Beautiful illustrations and photographs, and again, when compared to Guyton (where the illustrations were cheap and even shameful ... made by a high school art student?) the professional presentation and pedagogical context of Dr. Eric Widmaier's text was much better than the "Old" standard. Depth of coverage in some areas might be slightly less, but still the learning is there for the taking. I love this textbook, and I am convinced students studying from it will fair as highly on board examinations as those trying to learn from any other standard text in the field of introductory physiology.  +books
Just the text, ma'am+P+This Modern Library edition runs true to form, lacking much in the way of supplemental material or notes but providing a good basic presentation of the text on quality paper in a good binding.  An edition to keep on the shelf for occasional reading rather than a student's book.  If there's a really good scholarly edition of the "Morte" out there I don't know about it - anyone? +books
Live Writing+P+I think everyone should go and buy this book. It is worthy of 5 stars.This book trys to help you become a better writer by sharing some of Ralph Fletcher's experiances. If you like this book I reccomend you read Spider  Boy or A writer's notebook. ( The book before Live Writing+books
EXCELLENT READ - SOME OF THE BEST IN THIS GENRA+P+It has been some years since this one hit the shelves, but it is non the worse for wear.  Actually, I have to agree with another reviewer in that I too, feel this is one of Wambaugh's best.  A true sory, brought to light in a very readable story like format.  It is rather unforgetable.  The author does a very good job of not only telling us a story (Wambaugh is, after all, first and formost a great story teller), but gives us great insight into the thoughts and motivations of the killers.  He gives us a wonderful profile of the oung officer who survived this horrible crime.  I cannot in all truth say it is as good as "In Cold Blood," but it comes pretty close to the mark.  Recommend this one highly.+books
excellent study+P+I wanted to express my agreement with the September 2005 review of Understanding Paranoia in the Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease, that says, "This book is an important and useful work...beneficial to laypersons...also helpful for clinicians...a valuable guide." To me, that says it all. +books
Say I know already+N+Fortunately I was given a copy otherwise I probably would have wanted my money back.  I didn't read anything beyond common sense advice and questionable opinions+books
Too Liberal+N+The authors cover many of the events that occurred during the timeframe so I believe you can get some decent background info from the book.  However, it is very political and seems to blame the country for not adopting a  social welfare state much sooner.  In many areas, it is too superficial and  quickly concludes &quot;where was a government program to cure these ills  of history&quot; and doesn't really explore the causes of problems.  Case  in point, American farmers fed the world during WW-1 as European  agriculture was in shambles.  That allowed American farmers to enjoy strong  prices and high incomes in the war years.  But in the 1920s, the European  farmers were back and the market suffered from classic oversupply and farm  incomes declined.  The authors don't report that or even classify the war  years as an anomoly for farmers.  Instead, they focus on the unfairness  that the farmers didn't participate to the same degree in the prosperity of  the 1920s.  The tone gets very upset with thoughts that the federal  government should have prevented this like our wonderful never-ending farm  programs of today that have us subsidizing the growth of tobacco and mohair  wool. In other areas, the book is wrong.  For example, it traces the  formation of the Federal Reserve System to JP Morgan's inability to stem  the bank failures and outflow of gold in the Panic of 1907.  Actually,  Morgan was very successful in rescuing the powerless federal government and  raising gold in Europe to prop up our banks.  The Federal Reserve System  arose as the government was worried about having one private man being able  to wield so much financial power. All in all, the historical background is  there and is a good primer, but be prepared to listen to a lecture of what  is fair and right and what is not+books
Love it or hate it+N+This is the favorite book of a friend of mine, she rereads it every year. She chose it for our bookclub, and the rest of us hated it! I think this is the best example I know of a book that either really connects with you, or doesn't at all. I have a degree in Eng. Lit. and certainly have encountered a number of books written in an unique or poetic style that I loved, but this one was for me rambling, full of tedious detail that lead nowhere and, since I didn't like a single character, I never felt invested in anything that happened to them. For others what was tedium for me, was poetry. I made myself read the whole book for the sake of the bookclub, but it was like taking medicine--still I can see that every word was a joy for my friend. This isn't a matter of being good or bad, its obviously a masterpiece for some, but if it isn't your kind of writing, you will find it more than a chore to get through+books

Rugg's Recommendations on the Colleges - 23rd Edition+P+No pictures of students sitting on the grassy area in front of the ivy covered brick building.  Plain and simple, who has the best major programs, period. Every colleges claims they have a fantastic math, art, etc... department.  Rugg's is the book that gives you some idea of how good a certain major program is at a particular college. So if you are looking for a top physics program with a strong art program, you can find it. Ruggs is the go to book, it rates the major not the school's glossy brochure. Undecided? you can use Ruggs to find the schools that have strong programs in the 4 areas you are interested in so if your first major choice doesn't work out, you can change majors without having to change school.

A disappointing book about a tragic figure+N+After reading Robert Caro's masterful biographies (Volumes 1 and 2) of LBJ, I yearned to learn more about the background of Lady Bird--specifically what contributed to her not only staying married to LBJ but to singlemindedly propelling his career forward.  Well, Russell's book certainly disappoints.  It is very poorly and awkwardly written and edited.  The only new information that I gleaned from this book was gossipy.  If one  wishes to learn substantive information about Lady Bird (and of course about LBJ), Caro's biographies are a far superior source+books
Delightfully Delicious +P+Not only does Kathy Casey's Northwest Table have delightfully delicious recipes it is a great read. The photos are amazing and remind me how grateful I am to live here in the Northwest. I look forward to using each recipe. The articles along with the recipes give me further insight on the food I am preparing, helping me to better understand food and to be a more educated chef! She has a unique artistic talent that should be shared with all!+books
Not flash cards+N+The content is good, but these aren't actually flash cards. It's a bound book with very thin pages and two words to each page. Studying with flashcards is best done by testing one's self with cards, slipping failures back into the deck for near-term review, and setting repeated successes aside. This isn't possible with a book.+books
Championship Ball by Coach Clair Bee+P+The book I read was Championship Ball, by Clair Bee. Championship Ball is about a high school basketball player named Chip. Chip is an extremely good athlete and is a starting basketball player for his high school. Everything was going great until something happened that would change Chips life forever. During a basketball game Chip got tripped up and hit the ground hard. As Chip was writhing in pain, the team trainer came out to assist him. As it turned out Chip had fractured his ankle in several places. It was pretty bad which would mean that he would have to watch the games from the team bench for the rest of the year most likely. As his team goes on without him, they are doing quite well. They are making a championship run, and they are doing quite well, and they eventually get there. Before the big championship game, Chip was begging his coach to let him play. Chip's coach is not sure if Chip is ready to play just yet, but Chip is by far the best athlete on the team. Will Chip get to play in the big game, or will he have to spend yet another game spectating from the bench. I really enjoyed the book because it is very suspenseful, and it is hard to put down. It is suspenseful because throughout the book the author does not tell you Chips condition in its entirety, and whether or not he will get to play in the up coming games. There was on thing that I did not like about the book and that is the repetitiveness. It seemed like every time a big game was about to unfold, the same thing happened on the court. Also every time Chip asked his coach to play, he always said no, so you kind of almost expect it.  My strongest reason for recommending this book is that it is very well put together. Also if you are into sports or you like suspense and action, then you will probably love this book because it has all of these aspects.+books

Just plain dumb...+N+When I saw this in the library, I guess I was expecting another version of The Nanny Diaries, which was cute. This "novel," however, was poorly written and jumped all over the place; there were no smooth transitions at all. It was basically one big promo of her company--any time she mentioned a "horror story" she was quick to add that it wasn't one of HER nannies. Basically, I thought it was boring and that the writing style emulated that of the 3rd graders I teach. It took me about an hour to read, after which I thought, "How did THAT get published?" If you want to read a nanny book, try the Nanny Diaries. This book is stupid.+books
An engaging and very thorough history of the Hope Diamond+P+This is a fascinating book! Kurin gives a color and life to the history of the Hope Diamond, showing the interesting characters and lives touched by the "curse" and also those lives that have been positively affected by the diamond.   There are photos, paintings, illustrations, and cartoons interspersed in the text to help bring alive the history of the gem. The writing was smooth and accessible and I truly enjoyed the look into history and past cultures as the author brought us on a world and historical tour of the Hope Diamond+books
Easily the premier book on the subject of pain and suffering+P+This great work by Phil Yancey was the Christian book of the year in the 70's, and has lasted the test of time.  This is easily the best book on the subject of pain and suffering that I have read; it's teachings are on the mark and scriptural.  Yancey nails it when he writes that the suffering in this world is a democracy; that we are all part of it, we all suffer, and we all can help.  He makes some fine points considering all areas of the subject.  He clearly balances the sovereignty of God and His will with our blessings as His children and our works.  He hits on sowing and reaping, as well as the fact that just like Job, sometimes bad things happen to us not as a direct result of anything we did.  What I like best is Yancey dives right in, going to Leper colonies and interviewing with people who have suffered life-time dehabilitating injuries.  It's interesting to see how they've coped and how they view God, and how their suffering has changed their personal relationship with God.  Indeed suffering is universal, yet there is no universal answer behind the causes of it or how to deal with it.  I've heard pastors preach that people have died because they smoked cigarrettes, or got a sexually transmitted disease because of permiscuous sex.  But the question begs to be asked, what about those who did those things and didn't die?  Is it different for a Christian as opposed to a non-Christian?  What man on this earth walks close enough with God to have the power to decide what sin resulted in what judgment?  If earthquakes are a judgment from God,... are headaches a judgment from God too?  And it's certainly an issue that none of us should be pompous about.  One reviewer gave this book a one-star rating, saying that "God gives suffering when believers desecrate his house."  This is a type of religious crap that this book dispells.  Isn't it true that none of us are righteous; even our righteous acts are like filthy rags to the Lord?  Then are we categorizing sin by saying that homosexuality can destroy a nation, but the hateful attitude of a right-wing pastor cannot?  If Christians who tithe are to be blessed by God, then why have some 'tithers' went bankrupt, while some athiests (and Christian false-teachers) become million-aires?  Did 9/11 happen because of the liberal and homosexual communities, as said Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson?  Or did it in fact happen because W and the family have gotten in bed financially with Saudi Arabia and other Muslim nations, none of which give a rats a__ about America, and even profited from 9/11 when America spent billions on weapons and defense programs..... run by Saudis.  Only a true biblical view of the causes and lessons of suffering can help our walk with God to be more fruitful.  You'll find no faith/health/prosperity quick fixes in this one.  You'll also find nobody on this earth who knows all the answers.  This book definitely gives power to that journey with Jesus Christ, however.  Just wondering.... a reviewer of this book has declared a "Chinese victory over the USA", and that China is a 'more Christian nation'.  Woa, dude.  They must have better drugs in China too, apparently+books
Obviously Yancey is a Pop Psychologist who has No Respect for the Bible+N+Mr. Yancey has no respect for the teaching of the Bible.  God is always there when it hurts.  In fact, God allows hurt.  Look at Book of Job.  God allowed Satan to kill Job's children (!!!) and tempt his wife away from Job and give Job a horrible disease.  God was always there.  In fact, God was a part of the plan to CAUSE Job to suffer.  Why?  On a whim.  Satan said that Job would lose faith if disaster struck him, so God said, "Okay, give it your best shot!"  Sometimes, God sends disasters into your home for a whim, for a wager with Satan.  This is the lesson from the Book of Job.  Sometimes, God Himself brings pain and death because Christians refuse to uphold the interests of the Kingdom of Christ.  Look at the book of Jeremiah.  It was God who chose to kill Israelites, destroy the Jerusalem Temple.  In fact, Jeremiah specifically states that King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, who was not a believer, was anointed by God to bring destruction.  It's like God anointing Bin Laden to destroy America.  That would be the similar analogy in terms of anointing a hostile unbeliever to destroy a believing nation.  The Bible is clear that God chose King Nebuchadnezzar to destroy the Jerusalem Temple and kill Israelites.  And anyone who opposed King Nebuchadnezzar opposed God Himself.  How does this apply to Bin Laden.  This is how seriously God takes desecration of His House, the Christian Church.  God will raise up an unbelieving enemey to destroy America if America desecrates God's houses.  And opposing this anointed enemy would be opposing God Himself.  Mr. Yancey should think seriously about what God teaches about suffering.  God gives suffering when believers desecrate His house.  God sends death and destruction when Christians refuse to uphold the interst of Christ.  This is an important lesson for America to learn+books
Memoirs of a Memory+P+I had my copy of Memoirs Found In A Bathtub confiscated by my 9th grade french teacher in 1977. Hey, it was a 30 minute free reading period. I learned of Kafka's influences on this book ,and their shared heritage, years later. Searching for knowledge can be a treachorous endeavor. The authorities and experts can't always be trusted - especially when they no longer have paperwork to bolster their position+books
To master technical writing+P+I have been a technical writer for years. This book has made me re-think how I write technical articles. It is excellent. It has clear, concise instruction and examples. If you are planning to learn more about how to create technical writing this is the book+books
Cherry Jones +P+The thing about audio books is the reader, who can make or break the aural experience.  Cherry Jones makes what would otherwise be a dated novel come alive.  Her ability to portray multiple characters of both genders is astonishing+books
Brain Sex+P+Excellent,based in scientific research. It is not a "sexual book" but a well written book about hormones,thinking, acting and why men and women are different+books
A must read for anyone interested in &quot;Western&quot; life.+P+Anyone who has seen and felt the vastness of west Texas will want to read this book. Kelton's characters and settings are remarkable and genuine. This was one of the finest books I've read and it goes far beyond being catagorized as a Western.  It is about people and relationships with others and the land+books
Good Seller+P+They did a great job and got the book to me really fast, and it was in good condition.+books
Wayne - Baltimore,Maryland+P+The White Mountains is one of the most interesting books I ever read. The White Mountains Is a book about a 13 year old boy named Will who lives in a world ruled by alien machines called Tripods. The Tripods use caps make humans their servants, and to control their thoughts. The Tripods called certain days "Capping Day". Every summer Tripods come to put caps on people of a certain age. To humans it is a sign of adulthood.  A year before the summer that Will is supposed to be capped, his best friend Jack is capped. Months afterwards a vagrant named Ozymandias comes. A vagrant is someone who has been capped, but has a problem following the orders of the Tripods. This creates a brain fever, and the vagrant starts traveling to different place. When Will meets Ozymandias, Ozymandias tells Will of a place called the White Mountains where there are no tripods. A month later Will sets out on a journey to the White Mountains, and his cousin Henry tags along.  So I think the book is great I give it 5 stars. It is good for people who like Sci-Fi+books
Style of writing is painful+N+Just start reading the introduction, or flip to anywhere in this book to see all you need to know about it's readability:  a bit rough to say the least.  For example, in the introduction, the concept of carrying binary data in a shorter period of time on a wire than several measured pulses was presented in such a confusing manner that I was forced to read it 4 times to understand what was already a simple and understood concept to me.  The excessive formality of this book is a killer.. It reads at times like a formal mathematics proof book, however,  at other times it is a bit more readable.    Like people said.. use this for reference.. not for a textbook+books
Take what this book has to say with a grain of salt.+N+The spiritual comments are marvellous, but the factual content is dodgy. Z. seems to think that a woman will always get her period at the same phase of the moon. But the typical 28-day menstrual cycle is *shorter* than the  moon's cycle of 29 1/2 days, so it won't stay in step. (Besides, many  women's cycles are a few days shorter or longer than the average.) Z. also  says the Earth and Sun are getting closer together at the Northern  Hemisphere's summer solstice; that's actually close to aphelion. (It's the  tilt of the Earth's axis that causes the seasons, not our distance from the  Sun.) And as for astrological birth control, and garlic juice as a cure for  cancer...! An inspiring book - but take it with a grain of salt+books
Scholarly Insights into the Book of Acts+P+The late Dr. F.F. Bruce was a well respected biblical scholar and his commentaries and books have greatly benefited the Church of Christ.  It is no different than with this work on the Book of Acts.    This book falls in line with the rest of the New International Commentary on the New Testament edited by Gordon Fee.  The NIC is a solid evangelical commentary on the New Testament with the differing opinions stated in the works (see Revelation for example).  Dr. Bruce has gone to great lengths to point out the differences among evangelicals in Acts.  The commentary itself is full of Greek word studies, historical and geographical points, maps, and solid exegesis of every passage in Acts.  My only drawback with this work on Acts as well as the other works of the NICNT is that they are not laid out in expository outlines.  It would be helpful if every section was given an expository outline to help the reader when moving through the sections of the Scriptures that the authors are working through.  For a better expository outline see the commentaries of John MacArthur or John Phillips+books
Who were the Mulvaneys?+N+This book was neither bad nor good and therefore leaves me with little inspiration to write a review. What must be said is that this book had great potential, which was never fully developed. The idea was good. Even some characters were good. Well, actually just Patrick. And come to think of it, I ended up liking Muffin (the cat) more than I did any of the other Mulvaneys. Though even as a cat lover, I got sick of hearing about Muffin and the other animals which were way too many in the first place.  The book did go on and on, too much description about the ordinary (and, oh so cliche at times!).I didn't like the way it jumped between 3rd person and 1st person narrative. I didn't find it confusing, I just found it awkward. It didn't give the chance to really get inside Judd's head (I mean, it was "his" story after all).   I couldn't love or hate anyone in the book. It was hard to tell what their motives were and "who" the real person was inside them. They seemed so in-and-out of character. Maybe that was the author's way of exposing them as phonies? I'm not sure. But without love or hate, there's really nothing left to feel as a reader. Left to chose between a ditzy mother, a jerk-of-a-father (but not a jerk enough to hate him or care about what happens to him), an eldest son who is like a prop in this book, a brainiac son who gets revenge only to disappear and become someone completely different without warning or reason, a victimized daughter, that you can't really feel all that sorry for, the youngest son (also a prop), I'm not sure who to root for (if anyone).  The worst part was, just when I started warming up to the book (forgiving its flaws, hoping for a great ending), I was hugely let down. It took me about a week to finish the last 2 chapters because the end of the book just dragged and I found myself too tired to pick it up. We are told in a quick (but ironically again, long and tedious) after-the-fact fashion about what has become of Marianne and then in the Epilogue everything is "wrapped up" quickly and neatly with no realism whatsoever. I feel if you're going to resolve things in the end, then RESOLVE them---Tell us what it is and how it came to be without just glossing over everything. The book was long enough; some pages should have been assigned to the ending instead of all the fluff in between. This is a book that should make you cry, but I felt nothing (and I am one of the biggest crybabies ever).   If you want a good book about family and family secrets, read Ann-Marie MacDonald's "Fall On Your Knees" or "The Way the Crow Flies" instead. Both excellent books.+books
Rush and Me+P+I used to be a good friend to Rush. I listened to his program all the time. When I first saw this book, I ignored it. Finally, after it had been in the window of our bookstore for several months, I picked it up and looked inside.  I was amazed!   However, I had to put it down because I thought it was too negative. It called Rush names. I did not need to have that. Finally, I tried getting it at the library, but they said they did not have a copy, because they said it was "too controversial."  So when the price came down, I bought a used copy for a couple of bucks, and read the whole thing.  I was amazed some more!  Rush used to have 20 million listeners to his talk show. He was a legendary, rich talk show host. This book tells you exactly how Rush became a rich, popular talk show host. And he is thinner now that he has recovered from his unfortunate drug problem. And you know, that sort of thing could happen to anybody.  But I had trusted Rush, and his VALUES, and I kind of felt he let me down. So for me, the title is not appropriate. Rush Limbaugh is a Big, Rich Talk Show Host who Cuts Corners on His Values would be a better title. Rush is no idiot, either.  Now, by some "coincidence" Al Franken is a talk show host too. And, I bet he learned how by studying how Rush did it!  If Franken can do it, YOU can do it!  Don't miss out on this GREAT opportunity!  Get a copy. Look how cheap it is now. Tell your friends+books

Wonderful Meditations on Therese's Wisdom+P+"I Believe in Love" is a wonderful introduction to the wisdom of Therese of Lisieux. Reading it made me more fully appreciate her autobiography "Story of a Soul."  Each chapter of the book comprises different topics that she addressed in her writings, and serves well as a meditation. I think the author states that it is his intent to provide the reader with a personal retreat based on the teachings of Therese. I read one chapter a night before I went to bed.    Therese of Lisieux's approach to spirituality is accessible to any one in any walk of life. She describes souls as similar to different types of flowers. Some are roses, others lilies, and some like orchids, for example. And all can be equally pleasing to God in their own way, when seeking his role for them. People have different talents and different struggles, but these characteristics do not mean that any type is more valued than the other.    The chapters are divided according to topics that address needs of everyone; regardless of what type of flower they are. The topics are drawn from examples of Therese's life and writings, but the author also includes many biblical quotes and some writings of other Christians, such as Teresa of Avila, that support the advice given.   It is fitting that the first chapter describes love, as Therese sated that is the Church is one body, then she want to be its heart, that loves every one, because God is love. The chapter instructs how to demonstrate love to God and others through all actions of our lives, regardless of our station or ability. The chapter "Fraternal Charity" speaks in greater details about relations with others and how to fulfill our duties towards them  The chapter "Unshakeable Confidence" outlines advice for people who experience spiritual dryness. It amazed me to learn that Therese of Lisieux experiences dryness, and helps console me when I feel similarly, because if some one who lived as holy a life as she did suffered from this problem, than I should not feel disillusioned from the experience.  "Humble Confidence" is a chapter that provides sound guidance for acting in faith. It seems that there is a fine line between being confident in religion and proud, the latter of which is not a virtue.     "Abandonment to Jesus" and "The Cross" are helpful chapters for people experiencing difficult times, and anxiety about the future; whether it is the daily grind that is wearing one down, or a specific setback.  And Catholic may benefit particularly from the chapter on the "Eucharist," as the late Pope has named this year the "Year of the Eucharist."  The book is easy to read and personal. The organization of the chapters, are useful for providing support to people during different struggles. I read the book through once, and return to different sections, depending on my needs, but each chapter is a complete meditation in itself and the book can be skipped around. Each reading makes me appreciate them more.  +books
Interesting start to a new Drow trilogy+P+Sacrifice of the Widow by Lisa Smedman is the first book in the Lady Penitent trilogy. For fans of the Forgotten Realms, this book follows up on the events of the six book series War of the Spider Queen. So, before I start this review, if you have yet to read the War of the Spider Queen series, I strongly suggest you do before you read this as events from that series are talked about, and have consequences, in this book. If you choose to read this book, and most likely this trilogy, without reading WotSQ then there may be some things that just don't make sense - So consider yourself warned.  The plot of this book is not your traditional plot, in that it is not really one linear plot with a few sub-plots sprinkled in. The sub-plots are very good and hint at much larger ramification that will more than likely transpire in the next two books. There is the sub-plot of what really happened to Hallisstra Melarn at the end of the sixth WotSQ book, and how she became what she is now. There is a sub-plot of the followers of Eilstraee fighting followers of tow other entities. There is also a sub-plot of a larger `battle' between Lolth and Eilstraee. Ms. Smedman does a wonderful to weave all these sub-plots together to create not only an engaging story, but a seamless one at that. When the sub-plots shift between one another there is not much transition that throws the pace of the book off at all. The overall plot is very well written and easy to follow.  There are several characters in this book. This is both a good thing and a bad thing at the same time. With all the different sub-plots there needed to be many characters to keep everything going. However, with this amount of characters there is less time for them to be developed fully so the reader has a better connection with them. There are a few characters that I would have definitely liked to read more about, and maybe that will be remedied in the next two books. Don't get me wrong, there was some character development in this book, such as that of Hallisstra, her brother Q'arlynd both had significant development. Yet, the majority of the characters had little development. I believe that was just a part that had to suffer due to how much the plots of this book needed to be explained.  Overall, I enjoyed this book quite a bit. This is not your traditional Drow novel in that it's not strictly about subterfuge and chaos. The pace of this book is very good and Ms. Smedman's writing lends itself to be easily read. It's very easy to read through one hundred pages and wonder where the time went. With some Drow books, the authors try to make these huge grand flourishes of prose, yet in this book Ms. Smedman seems conserved and this creates an easy feel.  If you are a fan of the Forgotten Realms and have read the WotSQ series you will undoubtedly enjoy this book for the continuation of that storyline. If you are a fan of fantasy in general and know a little about the Forgotten Realms I still believe you will enjoy this novel, although some things may not make much sense to you. At any rate, if you are considering reading this, I have no qualms about recommending it. It's a very nice addition to the Forgotten Realms universe.+books
Horrible!+N+Elaine Feinstein obviously didn't have access to many sources for this VERY poor biography.  Sylvia Plath certainly cast a huge shadow over Hughes' life, but we get very little insight into the Hughes-Plath marriage from Hughes' perspective.  Feinstein doesn't know how to write biography--a difficult art form for anyone who isn't willing to hurt feelings or take criticism.  Feinstein didn't want to annoy ANYONE with her lame book.  Dates are given incorrectly and names are misspelled to the point at which I wonder exactly how much attention the author was giving to her sloppy manuscript, and how quickly she felt she needed to get it published before somebody else decided to cover the subject of Hughes in a thorough, responsible fashion.  Don't waste your money on this book.  Check it out of the library if you must, but don't buy it+books
Fantastic revealing look into the human soul+P+Laskowski creates a amazingly insightful and poignant look into the  mind and spirit of a man with a brain injury who lives in a group  home in Montana.  The novel explores Robert's relationships with his caregivers, his parents, his son, and his peers in prose that is honest, thorough, and poetic.  Beyond being just a book about brian injury, this is a book about the general human condition, about someone wanting to be the best he can be, about someone trying to relate meaningfully with parents and child, about someone trying to navigate succesfully our confusing postmodern world.  A must read+books
The Circle Trilogy is the Best Fiction I've Ever Read+P+Black is the first book in the Circle Trilogy and this story starts off with a bang...literaly.  Thomas Hunter finds himself being shot at as the story begins and things only get better and more exciting from there.  Thomas is the world's only hope, and he's also the world's only hope.  On two different worlds, life as it is known will be wiped out if he can't save the world.  Only he can save these two worlds, and he must save them both to survive, if he dies in one world he will die in the other.    This story is intriguing as well as captivating.  From the moment you pick up Black until the moment you put down White (the 3rd book) Dekker will pull you into the story while taking you on a journey that teaches you deep spiritual truths and helps you see God more clearly.+books
Very good book+P+This book is terrific. The moves between Outland, Fairyland, and England are VERY confusing at first, but once you get the gist of the work it is a very enjoyable! The way Bruno talks is theonly very annoying part. His oos and other such shortenings (y'reince comes to mind) are very odd, but he is always followed by a correction by his sister Sylvie. All in all, this is an amazing book+books
Disappointed Mac User+N+I bought this book expecting to be able to find exercises that would help me REALLY learn the product. Boy, was I in for a big surprise. If you're a mac user, FORGET IT! This book assumes you're using a PC. Last I checked, many people who do web design are mac users. When I got to the first screen and saw that what was shown in the book was different than what I had on my computer, I gave up. It may be helpful for PC users, but if you're a mac user consider yourself ignored . . . yet again+books
Not so good+N+Disappointing tome with numerous factual mistakes and a lack of understanding of those the author is interviewing. The book is far too dependent on paper sources and fairly clueless on the ground+books
Ethnocentric and quite boring+N+I was so disappointed by this book I could not get through more than a couple of chapters.  The author may know about mountaineering, but he seems to know very little about Kenya.  Moreover, I found the writing to be ethnocentric and quite boring+books
Definitive...a wonderful addition to my library+P+I purchased this book when it first came out.  I thoroughly enjoyed it at that time, and have used it as a reference ever since.  What so many do not realize is that different treatments (distillation vs. tincture vs. absolute vs. hydrosol, etc.) of a plant result in often VERY different properties comprising that substance.  So finally having some insights into the properties of hydrosols, the water remaining from the distillation of a plant, is/was much needed.  No other work like it had been available.  And what a revelation about many of them.  Most people, even those working with essential oils and their cousins were not aware of what this or that hydrosol might do, let alone how to get their hands on it.  Really needed and really wonderful work+books
Not for the uninitiated+N+I am currently taking an undergraduate course on Cather, and I hoped that this book would provide some insight into a side of her not covered in the course. However, I found the book full of jargon which rendered it  incomprehensible to me. Perhaps if you are already initiated into the world  of &quot;queer studies&quot; you will find it interesting, but I don't  recommend it for a casual reader+books
One of "bookdom's" absolute best reads!+P+This has got to be one of the most touching and powerful books I have ever read in all my 48 yrs as an avid reader.  For anyone who doubts that God takes broken people and makes masterpieces, this is a "must read".  To see the Hand of God weave these lives together and make a beautiful tapestry was a joy for me.  I have very few books that made me cry, but this one evoked every extreme emotion from me.  To top all that off, it is a true story.  An absolute pleasure and a cherished experience.+books
erudite and interesting+P+Romines' study of the Little House books is learned and informative.  She alludes to many current discussions in literary studies.  I recommend this book for the college student who is interested in children's literature and/or women's writing.  Don't be put off by the negative reviews of readers who wanted hagiography rather than analysis+books
Difficult to start, difficult to put down+P+I had this book on my shelf for a while before I cracked it open, knowing nothing about it except the synopsis on the back and that it came recomended from another book.  The author goes into slight tangents of historical events -- at the beginning it seems pointless.  After a while, you understand all the links, and begin to become very interested in this character that is much like many careless intellectual college drop outs who never found it fullfilling and always found themselves bound by the system.   Maybe I liked it because I identified with her -- almost too much -- even though she is far richer and always seeking to put herself in a situation most level headed people wouldn't.  That's what makes her facinating.   In hind sight, I can see why many people didn't like it, but reading it, I was devoured by her smart writing style and the storyline.  Not until 3/4ths into the book you suspect anything out of the ordinary.  Suspensful, definately.   The last chapter was kind of anticlimactic.+books
BIG disappointment+N+The acclaim and good reviews for this book are mistaken - it is average work by an above average artist who his a sophomore slump with this, his second book. Sleeping by the Mississippi, as derivative as it may be, was deeper and more soulful than this work which offers not much new in contemporary photography.+books
A book full of examples of how NOT to write perl+N+I couldn't resist the title, so I got this book. Unfortunately, I cannot reccommend it to people who want to learn to write better Perl, execpt as a source of examples of the mistakes you should avoid.  For example, in one of the earliest examples, the authors uses "return undef" in a situation where the return value of the routine is assigned to an array, to indicate the routine didn't find any of whatever it was looking for. Unfortunately, this is a mistake, the correct code would be to use "return;" all on its own. The correct solution produces an empty array or interim values; the mistake creates an array containing one element, 'undef'.  There are a number of similar mistakes which indicate the author is in over his head, writing things he doesn't understand; the editors know even less about the matter; and the code was never tested and verified for correctness.  If you want to learn Perl, get "Learning Perl"; If you want to improve your Perl, get "Intermediate Perl.  To+books
Randcek+N+In the 1950s, television filled the void left by the Senate inquiries and the imposition of the comics code. A new resurgence in the 60s, comic books were exciting again, carrying into the 70s spurred by superhero AND horror/mystery comics. Bottoming out again in the eighties, this time the culprit- video games.  Today the enemies, television and gaming, are still with us vieing for our time. Comics are not truly accessable to the buying public. They've become the property of an exclusive club that seems to revel mostly in some artist's wet dreams. How nice to know they can excercise his or her artistic rights and freedom. But no one is buying it! It's dead for all intents and purposes. Comic shops have to fill their shelves with collectible toys to make it. The comics I buy are at liest more than 30 years old. The new ones just are not interesting and even with all of this self-examination and navel probing, the quality just isn't there. It's my opinion that it doesn't have to read like Shakespear and look like Rembrant to be a good comic. But it must entertain. The effort has been underway for years to leave the lowly comic book in the dust, replaced by the Graphic Novel. All in the name of impoving (the perception anyway) of the comic book market! Even HBOs Tales From the Crypt" opening credits state 'Adapted from the comic MAGAZINE...'  The internet will not save comic books. It isn't a 'book' in the first place. Illegal downloading will kill it. Scanning comic books is already a problem.  The salvation of the medium is in the hands of something that is not real? If you cannot hold it and carress it in your hands like a lover then it will not satisfy (oops, better watch my own dreaming!). I do have a love affair with comic books. The only salvation I believe are two things:  1) Comic books must be put back into the public eye through stores or what have you. Recruitment to comic books through casual 'walk by' customers who are not necessarily seeking out comics, they just happen upon them out in public stores. Yes, the great unwashed and 'unenlightend' masses parting with their three bucks is the only thing that will help save the comicbooks! 2) The superhero must die! And artists and writers must excercise self control or face the imposition of a new comics code+books
Not My Cup of Tea+N+I know I'll get criticized for not "getting" this book.  I read many books of the entertainment industry having studied the Red Scare of the 50s, numerous autobiographies, stories of the business side of the biz, and other novels such as this.  Most of my novels have been of more recent history and I read this based upon recommendation that it portrays another era.  Frankly, this bizarre underbelly of Hollywood is off the charts.  The one message of the book to me was that even in a more simplistic period, the lure of screen led to the same debauchery seen today.  Don't know why I didn't get it as this book is so highly recommended but be forewarned, it's not for everyone.  +books
obsolete?+N+I got this book to learn Mac OS X programming and was very disappointed.  There's way too much info on Mac OS 8 and 9, which is great for people who are migrating old applications; but if you're writing new applications like I am, it just gets in the way.  Many screenshots are old and do not look like OS X windows.  It talks about CDEF resources, which do not work in OS X; it does not talk about the updated way custom controls are done.  Code samples use WaitNextEvent(), which is deprecated.  There's nothing on quartz, but lots of info on quickdraw, which is deprecated.  Nothing on HIView, OpenGL, etc.  It appears that this was a great book in its day, but now, it'll probably just confuse you+books
Great book for 25 years ago, not current!+N+Please! A great idea 25 years ago, but I think the best in-shape player is Mr. Woods, period. This book was like Jack Lalane meets golf, lot's of enthusiasm but not current training+books
Excellent story for my 3-year old+P+I thought this was a wonderful story with exquisite illustrations.  My 3-year old was enthralled with it, and checks it out from the library whenever she can.  It's a good story about responsibility and treating  animals with understanding, as well as getting ready for Santa's sleigh  ride+books
Keeps on ticking...............+P+I bought and read this book many years ago and found it very helpful. I read it again a few weeks ago and was again able to appreciate it's value. Aside from the dated research, and some of the debate regarding the use of anti-depressants, it remains as fresh and powerful and relevant today as it was when it was published. It is definitely a giant step in taking the mystery out of depression and I would recommend it to anyone who wishes to learn more about the nature and treatment of this illness+books

21 days to write it and 1 second to reach the bin !+N+It simply didn't work for me.If you are beginner, you need more than this little book.The Screenwriter bible by David Trottier is the ONE.Do not expect to write any good stories in 21 days.Stop dreaming and start writing.This book is kind of hard to read so if it's for beginner, it is just done to to make your learning more difficult than anything else. Forget it and follow my advice above+books
Not worth the $$+N+Extremely basic! It would be useful to have on hand, but the $ is way too much for the few quick tips the book offers+books
The "Complete Guide" is Not Very Complete+N+Notwithstanding the L. A. Times describing this book as easy-to-use and informative, I found it close to useless. The basic problem is that it does not give information for any individual drugs - it gives info only for drug classes. As an example, I tried to get information on using Cipro for travelers' diarrhea. I had to look up Cipro in the index, where I was referred to the fluoroquinolones section, which lists Cipro along with 12 other wide-spectrum antibotics. There is no Cipro-specific information regarding usage, dosage, or anything else. (Nor was there any mention of travelers' diarrhea.) Since the information covers 13 distinct, although related, drugs, the information is necessarily very generalized. By way of contrast, The Essential Guide to Prescription Drugs 2006, which I purchased at the same time, does provide descriptions for individual drugs, and it lists travelers' diarrhea as one of the off-label uses for Cipro. The PDR Family Guide also lists individual drugs+books
helps kids adjust to middle school+P+'Space Station 7th Grade' is a great, funny, and enertaining book. My son is in the seventh grade and reading this book was like reading a real life story of a kid new to middle school.   I really enjoyed the part of the book when Jason first had to take a shower after PE. Students having to run around in a huge shower room together naked as jay birds is many elementary kids 'worst nightmare'. My son's PE teacher has really good pointers, www bganssle com tsshowers html, for parents and kids who share this worry. Kids who feel awkward about their first showers at school, trust me and be like Jason in the book and give it a try. Soon any discomfort will pass.   Do you have a son or daughter about to start middle school? Have them read Space Station 7th Grade. My son had to learn many new things when starting middle school, the book was a like a guide book to prepare him+books
Not useful+N+Although the work depicted in the photos is incredible, none of it is very useful.  Nice to look at - not at all practical for everyday painters+books
Only slightly better than Throne +N+Not quite the crapfest that was book 3 in the Ringworld series, but still a gigantic disappointment coming from Niven.  Children is plagued by the same things that made the previous novel so unbearable: flat, uninteresting characters, ridiculous names, obsession over interspecies sex for no reason other than to include sex in the story, and overall a poorly written plot.  To be fair, I didn't come out of this one as bewildered as after Ringworld Throne - don't even ask me to summarize THAT plot, I've yet to come across a decent one myself, mostly because trying to figure it out can cause lasting brain damage.  But even so, this novel is nowhere near the original Ringworld novel, or even Engineers for that matter.  Avoid if possible+books
A delightful little book...+P+I'm sorry to see that this delightful, albeit different, book is out of stock.  I would never expect it to be a best seller.  Nonetheless, the imaginative story and interesting art work are worth a look+books
One of the Best Books Ever...+P+This is one of the best books ever....I noted that a women said that we complain about racism in this country and do not truly understand what discriminate is...I am grasping that she was European America(i.e. White Ethnic, White, Fair Skinned whatever you want to call it)....I ask you this have your people ever been inslaved for nearly 400 years, have your people ever had attempts of racial/cultural genocides...Is it deeply ingrained in society that your people are lazy, inferior intellectually, etc....You would not even begin to understand, Typical White Person Syndrome...Don't Walk around stupid your whole life....   FYI...This is just the tip of the iceberg, I would love to intellectually cruise your stupid ideals, you don't begin to know sufferings...Continue to read some books and maybe you can something from them..+books
Great use of conversational humor+P+A friend of mine challenged me to find an example of a book that displays the one thing that remains Southern in our late 20th-century culture, and with Eudora Welty's &quot;Losing Battles,&quot; I found it! Southern  families have been strung across American since the end of World War II,  but the one thing that keeps us together is the family reunion. Welty's  work reconfirms this, and with her gift of conversational writing, created  a masterpiece. If you're lonely for a bit of catching up on family  information, even though the one depicted here may not be your own family,  this one is it+books
Pete, You Still Don't Get It+N+Don't read this book. I wish I hadn't. It ruined Pete Rose in my eyes, not because of what others have said about him, but because of what Rose said about himself. My grandpa was a huge fan of Pete Rose and once took me to meet him at Riverfront Stadium when I was around six. About the only thing I'm glad for with this book is it didn't come out in my grandpa's lifetime.  We all make mistakes. We're only human and that's what humans do: we screw up. Sometimes badly. I wish Pete Rose was in the Hall of Fame. I wish he was coaching the Reds today. I wish most of all he'd never placed a single bet on baseball. But as for Pete, like I said up there, he still doesn't get it, and I doubt he ever will.  This book was a disappointment for many reasons. It did give me a nice look at Pete's career with the Cincinati Reds and took me back to my grandfather's tales of how great the Big Red Machine of the 1970's was, but what was lacking in these 322 pages was contrition, and I think that was supposed to be what this book was about.  The Pete Rose I met in My Prison Without Bars, was a likable fellow, but underneath his trip down memory lane was a sort of combative, "this is somebody else's fault" attitude that put me off and I'm sure put a lot of others off, too. Rose admits at last that he in fact bet on baseball during the 1980's, a fact that surprised virtually no one, but instead of presenting an apology, or even a straightforward confession, Rose comes across as a bitter man, still trying to squirm away from his wrongdoing. He blames everyone from his friends and business associates, to Major League baseball (for not forgiving his gambling addiction as it did the drug and alcohol addicitons of other players). Rather than presenting the public with his mea culpa, Charlie Hustle, the greatest baseball player of his era, left me feeling negative toward him, and thinking he is a slightly unintelligent crook. Those were not images I had of the man before I started this book and I'm sorry that's how I felt when I was done.  If I could say something to the man whose life is the subject of this work, I'd tell him: Pete, you've led an interesting sixty-plus years. You're one of the greats and a hometown hero for what you did on the field. You deserve to be in Cooperstown. But your attempt to make amends with this book---probably your last chance, sadly--is a dismal failure and a backset. I remember well the night you passed Ty Cobb's all-time hitting record. I read this mostly to acquaint myself with a player about whom I heard so much growing up. I now wish I didn't know 4/5ths of what I now do know about you.  As I said starting out: don't read this book+books

Excellent book - Helps design EAI wisely+P+Reading a design patterns book for me is interesting when I find that nugget of coolness, the rest of the time it is plain boring. However, this book really keeps it interesting for the most part and still drives home the design points particularly around EAI. I think it would make a great book for someone wanting to get into design patterns, which is important for anyone writing integration applications. Also, it is a good all-around reference book for the serious and seasoned Java programmer who needs to know how to design integration. I have GoF, and I refer to this book more often from a practical standpoint+books
The Great Falling Away+N+A more appropriate title for this book would have been: "Transformed Away From The Truth...The Liberalization of the Worldwide Church of God; The Remarkable Story Of A Church's Journey From the Religion OF Jesus to a Religion ABOUT Jesus".  Love him or hate him...the lectures, broadcasts, published books and magazine articles of Herbert W. Armstrong brought many thousands of people all over the world to the knowledge and acceptance of Jesus Christ as personal saviour...many of whom had never even considered attending a church before!  This was no pop culture 'plastic Jesus', but the Christ of the Bible...whose actual teachings would still be much in disfavor in today's supposedly 'enlightened' Evangelical world. Yet, the author of this book vainly tries to insist that the Worldwide Church of God under the direction of Armstrong was more hung up on the 'Law of Moses' and the 7th Day Sabbath, rather than the "grace" of Jesus...and thus relegated Him (Jesus) to background status behind God the Father, and Bible Prophecy.   In 1976 the WCG published perhaps the best book written to date about the life, person and teachings of Jesus Christ, "The Real Jesus" by Garner Ted Armstrong who, at the time was a high ranking Minister in the denomination.  This, along with all the other Christocentric books and articles published by Armstrong over the decades since 1927, are all strangely ignored...as if Armstrong himself, never gave Christ as much as a passing thought!  Joseph Tkach Jr. goes on to largely bear 'false witness,' as it were, against the Church; its teachings; its mission; and its founder and late Pastor General H.W. Armstrong. He takes Armstrong to task over having the audacity to actually think that God would use him, to start a new era in the chronology of Church history....yet he himself mulls over the same thing, in his own role in the destruction of the denomination, which ironically he sees as a new beginning 'under grace'...whatever that means, since he's gone on to disfellowship entire congregations in various parts of the country...for continuing on in the traditional faith and worship practices, and for refusing to adopt his new 'tupperware party' style of pop-worship service.   About the most interesting thing in the book, were the charts tracing all the breakaway conferences, or 'splinter groups' as he calls them...however, the biggest irony is that the largest breakaway group, "United Church of God" now has more members than the WCG under the Tkach regime!  Another shortcoming of the book is the total lack of comment on, or concern for the victims of the Church's meltdown; the divided families; the fired long-time Ministers and other employees, and the total disruption of the Colleges. Perhaps the Church's new leaders need to write and sell books to make an income; since over 100,000 members picked up and left the organization since Tkach and Feazell took over the reins. Make no mistake about it...he (Tkach) has his fans, who view him as a 'liberator', while his detractors suspiciously view him as the possible end-time 'Man of Sin sitting in the seat of Moses', mentioned in Revelation! Christ did say "Ye will know them by their fruits..." Thus far the fruits of Tkach's leadership have resulted in a bitter harvest+books
Similar stories crush this collection+N+Having enjoyed Russo's Pulitzer Prize winning novel "Empire Falls," I was eager to give something else of his a try. Maybe I should have selected one of his earlier novels instead because "The Whore's Child," interesting title aside, becomes tired and repetitive very quickly. The themes are the same in each story: aging male professor with an itchy prostate faces a mid-life situation, usually involving his younger second wife. That may sound too specific to relate to all of the stories in this collection, but you would be disappointed to realize that it is very accurate. The lone exception, and the novel's best story, is the titular work about a nun who is, in point of fact, a whore's child -- and the discrepancy between the generations makes for a poignant story. And yet, even that one includes a male professor character who is teaching the nun in his creative writing class, so similarities remain. Despite that, the story is great. The rest ... well, if Russo had done away with the other six achingly similar stories and expanded them into a single novella the book would have been much better. Russo is certainly capable of spinning a great yarn, and the themes are fine if a little familiar (Russo seems to be an author that excells in that domain). I just think you would do better to stick with the format best suited to his talents: his novels. I know that I will from now on+books
A talented writer who's wrong more often than right...+N+Reading John Simon's latest compilation of film reviews begs the question, does one have to be "right" to be a great critic or can simply writing cleverly and rigorously in defense of a basically incorrect critical assessment suffice?  What I have always admired about Mr. Simon is his unflappable way of sticking to his own view irregardless of the popular/critical consensus surrounding him.  Yet Stanley Kauffmann tended to give negative notices to many of the same films as Simon while writing more sympathetically, insightfully and fairly about the works, so where does that leave Simon?  Out in the cold I'm afraid.  Reading this latest Simon book is exasperating as he snootily dismisses one great film after another (Au Revoir Les Enfants, Saving Private Ryan, etc.)  I finally came to the consensus that however good a writer he is, he is simply too far off the critical mark...too often.    Simon has a famous reputation for been gratuitously nasty toward female actresses whom he doesn't care for the looks of and that continues in this collection.  As another reviewer notes, this latest collection also appears to solidify his reputation for being a homophobe too.  Going all the way back to his review of Zefferelli's Romeo and Juliet in 1968 (where he accuses the director of being a [...] because of the nude love scenes) to his recent review of My Own Private Idaho which he quickly dismisses as a "homosexual fantasy" his reviews have had a nasty homophobic edge to them, something Stanley Kauffmann, Pauline Kael or Roger Ebert's writings have never had.  And the fact that he liked Outrageous! (about a drag queen) back in 1978 and Savage Nights (about a bisexual HIV+ Frenchman) in the 1980's doesn't absolve him in my mind for all the nasty remarks he's voiced elsewhere over the years regarding "homosexuals" (he never uses the word gay, it's always "homosexuals".    Simon's writing is just as caustic and technically proficient as always (and he still loves providing untranslated foreign quotes) but all that effort is at the expense of all too often unappreciative and skewed critical views.  For my money, the essential critics remain Pauline Kael, Roger Ebert, Stanley Kauffmann and David Thomson, soon to be joined by Anthony Lane of The New Yorker+books
A Must-Have for Anyone into Landscape Ecology or GIS+P+If the credentials of the authors didn't convince of the quality of this book, I'm not sure I can.

From the various issues of scaling to what analyses do what, this book is an excellent resource of theories and technologies involved in Landscape Ecology+books

Chaotic yet+N+"All life/ has song..." Stan Rice announces at the start of "Singing Yet," chaotic collection of poems from his prior three releases, plus several new poems. Rice (who sadly passed away at the end of 2002) displayed a flair for evocative imagery, but his poetry is so confusingly random that it's almost impossible to decipher.      The first parts of the book are a tangle of bizarre eroticism (comparing melons to a woman) and odd morbidity ("It is death's/drizzle we write/checks on/when we die/we bounce"). But in the "Some Lamb" section, Rice delved into some deeper, more real turf: the death of his daughter from leukemia. "We stopped beside a hole where she/was put by men who could not see."      With an actual focus, Rice's poetry shifts into aching confusion, describing his daughter's illness, death, and burial, all the emotions that came with it. Unfortunately, Rice's poetry doesn't improve after that, including in the stretch of new material at the end of the book -- while his style mellows out a little, Rice's poems are still surreal and still nonsensical. "The iceplants/turn to the sun/their purple/sadist flowers..."     Dreamlike poetry and strange images are not a problem. But Rice's poetry goes beyond strange and into incomprehensible. "Golden silver copper silk/woe is water shocked by milk/heart attack, assassin cancer/who would think these bones such dancers?" he announced at one point. Okay, whatever. Maybe it's about death. Interpret that as you will. While his poetry can be intriguing and seductive, most of the time it just seems like cool phrases tossed randomly together.      Certainly Rice can't be faulted for his lack of description. He could evoke astoundingly weird, Dali-esque images. The problem is, they seem strung together like beads. Rather than focusing on one and exploring it, he seems just to have tossed them together randomly, assuming that they will see profound despite their lack of connection. "Thunder no more, sky/big sandwich gold & coral" -- it doesn't evoke anything by itself, and it seems completely disconnected from what comes after it.      An overview of Stan Rice's poetry, with a stretch of new material, "Singing Yet" doesn't shed any more light on what went through his head. Nor does it make his random poetry any more appealing.+books
Excellent High Resolution Print found nowhere else+P+I can use "picture book" to describe Full Moon, as images contributed as the major part of this book. Don't think that this book is not worth reading, indeed, it is on the contrary, this is an extraordinary book, because of the photos.  There are a lot of astronomy books contain lots of photos, but when you read them, you would find the images are not so good at all, but not because of the photo itself, because of the low resolution. And if you are familiarize with those photos, you would immediately notice that the original photo is not so small in resolution. It is really a very bad idea for the publisher and editor to ignore the importance of image resolution.  However, when you first look into Full Moon, you will find you're getting into a different world as you are already delighted by the spectacular images of the Moon taken from Apollo Mission. Normally, owing to the technological limitation in 1960s and 1970s, all images are only mostly available as hard copy and not so high resolution. However, Project Full Moon can turn those hard copies into very high resolution images. I can even tell you that, NASA even don't have such high resolution images before.  Since these reasons, I would rank this book as my list of Top 10 Astronomy Book. If you really love astronomy, you must not miss this book, miss the extraordinary journey to the Moo+books
Toward a Queer of Color Critique+P+In this brilliant book, Rod Ferguson interrogates canonical sociologys' regulation of sexual difference as part of its pathologization of African American culture.  Sophisticated in its critiques of race, gender, and sexuality within analyses of cultural, economic,and epistemological formations, this book breaks new ground in sociology, American studies, queer theory, and women of color feminism.  Great for graduate and undergraduate courses on the problematic history of the discipline of sociology as well as courses on sexuality and queer theory+books
No one today writes better or writes better stories.+P+Beyond the quality of Kelton's stories, especially this one, is the quality of his characters. His leading character, an individualistic, independent, honest and brave rancher, is one of the most admirable people  I have ever read about. This was the first Kelton book I read, and I became  a Kelton addict. I have read and re-read this, and highly recommend it.  Excellent+books
Too verbose and no excitement in the writing.+N+As a Vietnam Veteran who was there in 1963 the flavor of the writing was drab and did not convey what was really going on from the perspective of the ordinary GI. Yes, there were some historical facts and biographical  info that was interesting but something was missing. I read about 25 pages  and gave up+books
This is no " The Accidental Diva"+N+I like the energy of the book. But the characters like Izzy and Rico I found to be more mulitfaceted than Destiny. Destiny sounds pretty,driven and of course she has a the "sad" story plot. But I expected her character to bring more. Yeah she is a hot party planner living in mom's shoes but felt something was missing from the character/reader connection. I thought Izzy had more juice!  Lyah Beth, write a book about her!Plus the "the knight in shining armor" came around like around page 176. The book is only around 250 pages! By this time I was waiting to met Mr.Taye Crawford and when he arrived he seems just as boring as Destiny's charater. I was very disapointed. This book is no "Accidental Diva+books
Potentially Damaging and NOT Recommended+N+I have no doubt the author is well intentioned and may in fact have had some good results with the exercises outlined.  HOWEVER, in my years of working with borderlines in clinical settings I think many of the exercises are unnecessary and potentially damaging.  Many of the people with BPD I have worked with have astonishingly traumatic abuse histories and to explore self-history without the tools necessary to contain the potentially explosive and RE-traumatizing emotions is foolish and even hurtful.  Furthermore, the author's assertion that the client be able to say that they want to use HIS text in therapy and the recommendation that if the therapist objects that the client move on to another therapist is TOTALLY misguided and naive.  I very much agree that it is important for clients to be able to guide their own work, but I am also highly aware of the ways people with BPD can split different providers.  There are just too many GENUINELY therapeutic reasons to approach the author's recommendations with caution to allow what he says to interrupt what may very well be extraordinary work between a therapist and client.  I STRONGLY SUGGEST PEOPLE LOOK ELSEWHERE, perhaps to the work of Linehan for more appropriate and helpful interventions.    If I could have, I would have given this book no stars+books

True, honest, heartfelt masterpiece+P+W. Somerset Maugham's Of Human Bondage is one of the best novels I have ever read. The language is simple. The narration is subtle. The characters are real and display emotions and feelings everyone can identify with. The power of novel becomes apparent when you are reading it. You choke up every once a while, you smile for hours after you have finished reading certain passages, and you comprehend your own self, your woes and possibilities, better through perspectives that novel provides.  Philip Carey is born with a clubfoot, and as he grows up, orphaned, he struggles with his own deformity. The initial quarter of the novel is about his growing up, and details incidents and relationships that shape our hero. He then develops a fancy of becoming a painter and travels to Paris, only to quit few years later to return to London, where he studies to become a doctor. The most engrossing part of novel starts here with the entry of Mildred, the waitress.  The rest of the novel thrives on the passion of Philip, his love that carries him to the edge of self-destruction, and his coming of age. Unrequited love has never been potrayed better. Philip allows himself to become an instrument in hands of cold-hearted Mildred, who repeatedly ruins herself through absurd choices, and ruins him for not withstanding his love and care, he finds himself snubbed, ridiculed, bereft. Eventhough his reason tells him otherwise, Philip is unable to release himself from his passion for a considerable time. As is said in the novel, "But when all was said the important thing was to love rather than to be loved; and he yearned for Mildred with his whole soul."  The novel is lot more than just story of Philip and Mildred, and there are other unforgettable characters. Each person Philip encounters and each friend he makes, leaves an indelible impression on him and the reader. Be it his idealist friend Hayward, who has too much promise too little product, the poet Cronshaw who dies in poverty, Fenny Price whose hard work cannot make her draw even reasonably well, his uncle and aunt whose love is both tacit and beautifully potrayed and the writer Norah who shows Philip of a caring and loving other.   The most charming people in the novel are Athlneys. Athlney brings life and humor into the novel, and I think saves Philip from a total destruction. The novel really highlights the virtue that lies in a simple, happy married life and Anthlneys win over both Philip and readers with their goodness and simplicity. Thorpe Anthlney with his nine children is a jolly character, and be it his conversations or actions, he wins over our hearts outright.   Philip finds love in most unexpected quarters and is surprised by how help crops up from strangers. His every experience makes him as richer as the reader becomes in reading about it. The thoughts about the meaning of life, or about love or religion or about virtue or vice, and about each aspect of life that Philip encounters are spelt out with a subtlety and mastery. These thoughts find easy resonance with the reader, and make Of Human Bondage an unforgettable affair. The honesty of this piece is stunning. This novel, written without any flourishes and intricate wordplay or mystery, is I think a celebration of the deep insight and understanding of the author.  I have read his other works. The Razor's Edge, The Moon and Six Pence as well as his short stories are a proof of Maugham's ability to tell simple tales with great mastery. These, on their own, make Maugham a great novelist. But it is after reading Of Human Bondage that I realized why most novelists and readers have considered this piece as one the greatest pieces in World Literature. Maugham's aim was perhaps of catharisis and he put his own emotions into the characters, and therefore, he's created a work that is timeless and unforgettable. A must read for everyone who can read. +books

Get the Whole Collection, good booklets for the novice+P+I personally like all of Baba Raul Canizare's booklets on the Orishas, each booklet comes with various Patikis "Orisha Mythology and Legends" Songs, Chants, and Prayers.

No much change+P+Although this book has been written almost 50 years ago it still provides basic insight into our behavior in the modern world. 'Money, prestige and power are the main incentives today for the largest section of our population - that which is employed'. This probably holds still today whereas some of the major concerns of the fifties are not concerning people any more.  A book to read and think about+books
Better than Roark's Formulas for stress &amp; strain.+N+This book has a lot of information most of which is useless calculus integration with vary brief summery which seems to me being derived from other books just thrown into the mix with general categories. The book is basically an oversized machinery's handbook but with a poorly written index and with a lot of inapt formulas that don't have a explanation for formula variables used in the equation.  If you do a lot of strength of material design I would suggest a machinery's hand book, or the McGraw Hill Mechanical Engineering Design book which is an excellent P.E. exam reference book. Stay away from the Roarks Formulas for stress &amp; strain book its more poorly written then the Marks+books
the BEST book I've read this year+P+Be prepared to weep at the end but this novel is beautiful. Writing is superb and the characters are not only believable but they stay with you long after you close the book.  Anjali is waiting for her husband, Prakash, to pick her up after a trip to her parents. Prakash doesn't show and Anjali faces a life-changing situation as a result. Anjali divorces, remarries and has a son, Amar. The story weaves their fragile lives with a past that comes into the present.  Chapters are short and moving; each brought across by the character's feelings and thoughts.  Can't say enough good about this story. Remember your kleenex and get ready for a novel to stay with you+books
Welcome Back!+P+Another great story in the world of Dragonlance!   I was so sad at the end of the War of Souls trilogy, as I thought it meant the end of the world of Krynn for me... I was wrong, and I celebrated the day I found out that Margaret and Tracy were writing prequels.  However, after the Star Wars debacle, I was slightly concerned that this was going to be a "Phantom Menace".   I am glad to say it is not.   This book takes place between Autumn Twilight and Winters Night, and revolves around Riverwind's evacuation of the Slave of Pax Tharkas after the rebellion, and Tanis, Raistlin, Sturm Caramon, Flint, and Tas's search for the Hammer of Kharas - used to make the Dragonlances.  This book focuses largely on Flint, which awesome considering that he played a much diminished role for the majority of the series.  Flint leads the companions in the search and has to deal with the dwarven bureaucracy and xenophobia in Thorbardin.  Compounding the difficulty is an especially clever and ambitious draconian who has fooled the world into thinking Lord Verminard still lives.  I swear, fans of Tas will love this book - as always he has some of the best lines and gets himself into the strangest situations.  My only criticism, [which is not aimed at the authors] and one shared by many reviewers, is the abysmal editing.  There were missing words, spelling errors, type-o's and so forth.  While this does not detract from the well-conceived plot, it does slow the natural flow of the read.  Hopefully the publishers will take an extra week for editing on the next instalment.   Anyhow, this was a great read for fans of the series!  Relic11+books
Reviewer+N+I am interested in succint yet exhaustive/substantive coverage of the topic for use in real-world corporate finance applications.  I found the book to be verbose and not sufficiently to the point.  The author peppers a few key insights in endless dialogue, which I find a bit tiresome.  The text could be better organized to highlight key points and provide greater substance and less fluff.  Definition of terms could be far better written even for an introductory text.  I suspect I am the wrong target audience+books
From a Deep Well+P+I was introduced to William Willimon through his sermons. He is a genius preacher and a prolific writer, having published hundreds of sermons and dozens of books. The insights in Pastor are the fruit of a life long lived in God's service. It is not easy being a pastor amidst the cultural mega-shifts underway. Many of us find ourselves in the throws of a vocational identity crisis. What in the world are pastors to give themselves to? Are they primarily preachers, Chief Executive Officers, ones who empower the laity, counsellors in the clinical vane or spiritual directors in the Catholic tradition? Drawing from a deep well of theological and historical insight, as well as years of pastoral experience, Willimon tackles these and other questions arranged in thirteen well-crafted chapters covering the full spectrum of pastoral theology. Pastor balances theory and practice, and is full of real-life examples from Willimon's own experience. One example is the way he comes against the individualist spirit of North American Christianity, and calls for pastors to see themselves as participants with all of God's people in transformative communities of faith and not merely as religious managers. I only wish that I had this resource twenty years ago.+books
LOVED IT+P+I wasn't sure at first if I would like this story. But I found that I could not put it down. It is a love story, but its so much more the DeVinci Code of vampires you might even say.  I like how the authors explain the reason for vampires and how darkness and light need each other to survive. This story takes its time, but its not boring. I loved all the characters, and didnt miss the sex scenes or gore. It wasnt needed and it would have taken away from the story. I want to thank the authors for this great story, great writing..+books
Carry On, Mr. Bowditch+P+This book takes place in the 1780s and is about a boy named Nat Bowditch. Nat is great at figures and he has great perseverance. Nat has just been taken out of school to help his dad make barrels for ships. But he wasn't good at it at all. So his dad got him indentured for 9 years at Ropes and Hodges. Afterwards he went on a ship and found out a new way to work lunars. After his first ship ride he went on several others and found over 2,000 mistakes in a book written by scientist. But don't get to atached to the characters+books

Dont waste your  kids' time!+N+I recently read this book for a ELAN class @ UGA. I thought it was terrible and pointless. The characters lack depth and the theme of the book is not developmentally appropriate for 7th or 8th graders. The book was around 100 pages and leaves the reader wishing he had done something better with his time. My professor scolded me for not wanting to read this book to my future classes. She claimed I was scared to read books to my kids. (I guess she is refering to the religious implications in the book) She is absolutely right. I am terrified to read bad books to my students.+books
A Must Read for history enthusiasts+P+Sheldon Stern has presented a harrowing study of one of the most dangerous events in World History - The Cuban Missile Crisis. In his book, The Week the World Stood Still: Inside the Secret Cuban Missile Crisis, we are presented with an event whose story line reads like it was written by a Robert Ludlum-like mystery writer, this story, however, was frighteningly true history. With the careful, thoughtful, and thorough research that is Mr. Stern's trademark, the reader is presented with the complete inside story of that fateful week. This is a must read for, not only students, but adults as well. Kudos+books
Seminal Work+P+This book is one of the only works that addresses the topic of Ecological Design in an in-depth manner. Moreover, it focuses on the progenitors of this movement - the design outlaws that had the courage to forge entirely  new and radical paths in art, design, science and technology. Powerful  stuff - important message - innovative and engaging subject matter+books
Accidental Fabrication+N+I haven't read Mr. Crawford/s book but I have read all 126 reviews.  Based on the reviews, not one soldier that served in Iraq gave the book a positive review.  That says those that know what serving in Iraq is like find the author something of a fraud.  It was pointed out that Mr. Crawford previously served in the regular active-duty army and therefore he should know what service in the National Guard is all about, including being recalled to active duty in a time of war.  You cannot over look this point.  Therefore, the rest of Mr. Crawford/s claims must be suspect if he misrepresents being an accidental soldier.  Drugs.  You don't do drugs in a combat zone.  I served in Vietnam and know that drugs and war do not mix very well.  I suspect that the people who praise this book have an anti-Iraq war bias. +books
IT 645 College Book Review+N+This book does not go well with the class, I would suggest to any university that is using this book for IT 645 class, to find a different author.+books
Great book for fans of Linda Ravenscroft +P+This book gives really good step-by-step instruction on drawing fairies.  From what materials to use to general drawing techniques.  I really love Linda's work so that is an added bonus. +books
Not really+N+I have a hard time understanding what it is that I dislike about the novel. I dislike it almost as much as the movie. I have been a loyal follower of Smiley and some more after that. Once the Cold War was over, JlC had to look for a new realm. I tried to follow him, but gave up with the Kaukasian troubles, forgot the name of the book. Maybe it is this: JlC's trade mark, his USP, is the evilness of the other side. With the KGB & Co., that worked perfectly. His readers were willing to stay with him and believe him. Now he is transferring the KGB style to all sorts of other badies. I think it does not work any more. It is not that I trust the pharmaceutical companies enough to not be like here insinuated. I do not. What I do not like, I guess, is the artificial mood of intellectual suffering from the evilness of all kind of conspiracies. Tess in this story seems to be the normal do-gooder who falls foul with the baddies. That is more ok in the book than in the movie. (There, for my eyes, Rachel Weisz does herself discredit.) What is absolutely not ok is the surrender of command by the narrator mid way. JlC gives up on trying to keep a believable storyline and declines into darkest conspiracy allegations+books
This Book Is Now Obsolete+N+With new findings from a scientist of the Los Alamos laboratory, the main thesis of this book-that the Turin Shroud is a medieval forgery-has been dealt a death blow. The new information clearly shows that the portion of the Shroud used for the 1988 C-14 test was, in fact, an additional weave to the Shroud threads made much later than the cloth itself, and that the winding sheet is much older than C-14 indicated. Even without this explosive new information, much of Nickell's thesis was outdated well before the year 2005. His "recreations" of the Shroud are amateurish and are not clear evidence of forgery. Most of his other information-"paint on the Shroud", no provenance before the Middle Ages-has also been debunked many times over. And his star witness, Walter McCrone, had his own reputation tarnished beyond repair when it was proven that his analysis of the Vineland Map was discredited and debunked(ironic, since both Nickell and McCrone tried to destroy and besmirch those who didn't agree with them).  In short, Nickell's book is now passe, and obsolete. It gets two stars for its entertainment value, but the main arguments and ideas of this book have been thoroughly refuted,once and for all.+books
Too little about Machiavelli's context and influence+N+This is a fine book if you want to see what someone very smart has to say about Machiavelli's major works.  What I wanted, however, was to understand the context in which Machiavelli wrote, and I would have loved to get some information on how and why his ideas began to have influence beyond Florence.  If you understand references to the founding of Rome, to 15th century Papal politics, and have a good grounding in Livy, this book is for you.  If, like me, what you wanted from a introduction to Machiavelli was to have someone explain Machiavelli's context and allusions, look elsewhere+books
The way it's done.+P+What to say about this book...it shows you wooden boat construction at its very, very best.  Starting with raw lumber and simple hand tools, Larry Pardey takes us, step by laborious step, on the odyssey of building a truly world class cruising yacht, his 30' Taleisin.  Not only is every step of the hull construction detailed, but we also get "real world" time and cost estimates so there are no illusions as to how much time and money each step will take.  There are superb "pro and con" treatments of aspects that have a variety of solutions.  If there are multiple ways to tackle a job, he makes two columns and discusses the pros and cons of each in detail.  Usually you just get the author's opinions without any extra information.  This book is famous also because of it's very important final appendix on epoxies in salt water craft, and how epoxy often is weakened to the point of failure by salt water, repeated stress, and heat - 3 things that a sailboat gets plenty of.  I am told by many epoxy fans that this chapter "is now out of date", but I don't remember any amazing new epoxies coming out that make Pardey's findings defunct.  George Buehler says it best - epoxy works best when it's backed up by a bolt.  "Praise epoxy but pass the nails".  Also note the title "The Hull".  That's all you get.  When it comes to decks, houses, rigging, etc., you're on your own.  Hopefully Pardey will bring out volume 2 on the rest of the boat.    He's a masterful carpenter and his work is glorious and gleaming, fully among the best of yacht-quality work ever done.  This is something you need to seriously soak in.  This is THE BEST, and not necessarily realistic for the average home boat builder.  This book represents a set of skills that you probably don't have, and may find difficulty developing in your lifetime, unless you are really dedicated.  Also, there is the time factor.  It's one thing to look at a photo of fastening planking on the frame and say "I understand that...I can do that!" and it's quite another to realize how many HUNDREDS of hours are involved in just a few of the aspects of the hull construction.  Pardey could work on his yacht full time - he didn't need to do other work to pay the bills.  He was also in the prime of his health.  Most Americans only have this kind of time if they're retired, and that often means not as strong as we once were.  If we're young and strong it means we have to work for a living.  So, this particular boat might be best aimed at the youngish man who doesn't have to work very much for his living.  Either that or you'll spend about a decade of weekends on this boat.    If you want to get on the water a little quicker than that, consider George Buehler's "Backyard Boat Building", for salty and sea worthy crusising yachts that the average man or woman can build themselves in a year or two, and actually take to the Caribbean, or further.  I'm not saying don't aspire to Pardey's level, but remember that you live in the real world.  It's better to build a simple boat than to not build a fancy one.  It's better to go sailing than it is to spend your free weekends for 2 years screwing down teak decking.  But, that consideration aside, there is no better guide to traditional yacht construction than this+books
Over 2000 entries+P+Blacklisted: The Film Lover's Guide To The Hollywood Blacklist is the collaboratively effort of Paul Buhle and Dave Wagner and an alphabetically arranged encyclopedia of entries concerning the films, directors, stars, writers, producers, designers, and others who suffered being blacklisted because of the House Un-American Activities Committee during their infamous Hollywood blacklist era. Over 2000 entries point the reader in the direction of grand works that were covered in shadow during a dangerous time in American history, including films such as &quot;Roman Holiday&quot; and &quot;Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;. Blacklisted is a welcome and greatly appreciated contribution to Cinematic Studies reference collections+books

great historical mystery +P+Sir George is a parsimonious, mean-spirited man who cares more about his cat Samson than he does his three daughters.  The cat, a mean old Tom who scratches everyone except for Sir George has been missing for two days putting his master in a fouler mood than usual.  Sir George wakes up quickly when he hears Samson outside and goes to find him.  Someone smashes him on his head killing him.  Since Sir George was the cousin of Queen Victoria, his case is very high profile so Scotland Yard assigns it to Inspector Gerald Witherspoon who has a phenomenal successor rate in solving homicides.  Neither Witherspoon nor his supervisors know that his housekeeper Mrs. Jeffries and the other servants of his house work behind the scenes to help their master solve his cases.  This inquiry is harder than most as everyone has a motive for killing the baronet, including his three daughters, his ex-lover, the gardener the housekeeper, and trades people he cheated out of money.  This is one historical mystery series that never gets boring or dull.  The author keeps the series fresh by making each homicide case original.  Lovers of late Victorian mysteries will thoroughly enjoy this tale because Inspector Witherspoon comes across as so innocent and naïve that readers will adore him.  Emily Brightwell is an author whose mysteries are well worth reading.  Harriet Klausner+books
A decent book, but it has some errors and details missing.+N+I was walking around the local library the other day and came across multiple books on writing. To my surprise, the public library had more books on writing than the college library. I thought to myself, "I've been looking for these kind of books to enhance my writing!" So I grasped this book in my hands and began reading away. As I continued through this book, I began to notice the editorial commas. I slowly connected the truth of the book's title to the content of the book: This was a book based around press and media writing. I found a nice and quiet place to read at the library's local history room and then sat down near a desk.  While reading, I decided to give this book a review, so I wrote down notes in a notebook. However, my logic and learned way of writing may or may not conflict with one from the press; but I felt that errors and other press related style and/or punctuation was not pointed out soon enough. Therefore, I was confused as to the difference between press writing and academic writing, and may have created a biased review. I would have liked the differences pointed out. Please don't smack me with the stupid stick for having errors in this review: I'm still working on my English. With that being said, onto the online *evil smirk* book review.  E-mail vs. email:  As much as I admire a businessman becoming a writer for The Journal of Technical Writing and Communication, he forgot one thing: E stands for electronic! Instead of being 1337, he went on this long rant about being an "oldbie" on the web and a javaslinger; he coded his first page in raw HTML (javascript). I'm oldschool, but at least I understand why it was called "e-mail." Something that I found silly was his inability to appeal to authority. Let me ask you something: If the owner of eBay were to write up a report about his or her company and list the company's name multiple times through the report, then would you accept that as the correct spelling? I would. Case closed. Appeal to creator wins.  Possible error at the top paragraph on page 59: "The first example, however, places 'and added' in a parallel position; thus the 'and added' clause is made dependent on the..."  Let's look at the semicolon and the word "thus".  Last time I checked, a person is suppose to use a comma after and independent marker; thus, a comma comes after 'thus'. Is the missing comma suppose to be some type of Associated Press (AP) writing editorial punctuation? You could smack me with a stick for not reading the AP style guide, but it would have been nice if the author and the copyeditors noted what was going on. Some of the material and possible errors at this point make me question if I should continue reading the book. I looked up semicolon in the index, and it was about 30 or so pages ahead of the past page I was at. I noticed the semicolon was feared by the author and not brought out in detail. I'm not chuckling. I've questioned a few of the matters in this book. I've been able to accept press vs. academic so far, but I'm starting to get concerned if what I'm learning is correct or not. I grabbed the book from the library to learn. However, if these are mistakes, then I'm a novice writer learning mistakes that weren't meant to be mistakes. I don't think that's a good way to learn how to write. Do you?  Let's go to the their vs. his or her debate:  I don't care who or what you are, I'm going to use his or her. If something is singular, it's going to stay that way. I don't approve of the media or some other brainwashing superpower to change the rules of English grammar. This is why I've got to love some of the reviews on Amazon.com. People don't seem to care about grammar. Makes me feel like someone is trying to sell me snake oil and the people around me are conspiring with the retailer. Apparently, I'm not the only one that feels this way. Not after reading the rest of the reviews here. May I mention that Amazon.com was advertised in the book? Yeah. Thanks for dumbing down grammar.  Another section was where he used a comma instead of a semicolon to creates sentences like the following:  Page 91: I like Trix, I like Lucky Charms, and I like Cocoa Pebbles.  Maybe I'm missing something here; maybe he was trying to detail something; maybe he's ADHD and forgot; and maybe the book is ADHD.  I like Trix, Lucky Charms, and Cocoa Pebbles. Thank you parallelism.  A person is suppose to use a semicolon instead of this serial comma junk he's selling; however, this could be a style concern. Another entry about style and its concerns with semicolons could have been inserted.  Yeah. I'm done reading after 60 pages or so. At least I read more than a fifth of the book.  Parts of the book I liked:  Introduction to brackets. It may not have been correct, but I understand what it's about.  "I've written a stylebook that I hope makes the following point: Be skeptical of stylebooks."  You seem to have accomplished your goal: Your book makes me borderline schizophrenic+books
A Nostalgic Classic+P+This is a beautiful book. It is reminiscent of the images and style of children's books published at the time when Disney originally released SLEEPING BEAUTY. This is a real tribute and a cherished edition to have from one of Disney's best and often overlooked fairy tale classics. It has a real place in my heart+books
Great Idea, but the book didn't quite pay for itself+N+This book had quite a number of scholarships listed, but some of them were of no use to 99.9% of the population of college students.  If I was interested in attending Generic College, USA, and I wanted to know what scholarships they offered, I would go to that college and ask them.  I wouldn't look it up in a general college scholarship book.  Thus it was frustrating when college-specific scholarships were listed for some schools, but not all.  Some of the listings were outdated, and I felt like I had to read through the whole book to make sure I didn't miss any scholarships I was eligible for.  I sent out about ten letters to different scholarship opportunities, and not all of them were responded to, and of those that replied and to whom I submitted applications to, no money was won.  Thus I was not very happy with my purchase+books
Mastery Explored---Excellent Read+P+***** This short and pithy small book contains a wealth of wisdom about mastery, which is described by the author, George Leonard in the introduction as "the mysterious process during which what is at first difficult become progressively easier and more pleasurable through practice", a "...long-term, essentially goalless process..."    This book was written in the early 1990's, but its message is timeless.  George Leonard relates the journey of mastery to his extensive experience with aikido.  Essentially, the book was inspirational to me, encouraging me to be enthusiastic about perseverence, patience, and most of all, about enjoying the process of learning what I am most passionate about.  Mastery is seen more as a journey than a destination.  Chapters explore topics such as loving the plateau, dealing with change and homeostasis, getting energy for mastery, and pitfalls along the path.    This book has a different perspective than others I have read.  I would highly recommend it. ****+books
About Ship!+P+Jolly Captain Jack Aubrey and his sidekick the bespectacled bohemian Doctor Maturin Return for this 7th book in the renowned Aubrey/Maturin series. In this segment, Maturin and fem fatale Diana Viller's romance heats up, Jack's money troubles become more pronounced, and Doc Maturin's career as a spy threatens to become the death of him.  What can I say about this great series? The character of Jack Aubrey is just SO endearing and Doctor Maturin is so priceless as the inscrutable doctor, that this series simply cannot be missed! Even the presence of Diana Villers (a character I've simply loathed for quite some time), seems less irritating.  I'm listening to the unabridged Narrated version by Patrick Tull, and this series is wonderful. Cannot be missed. Particularly love the parts where Jack/Maturin and The Swedish Envoy are in prison. Too funny! Wonderful series. I highly recommend it. +books
A Poor Book+N+I began reading this book in a local Christian bookstore. I was utterly shocked at the bad reasoning that is passed off in this book as "proof" that popular trends, including Pokemon and Harry Potter, as evil.  The author first claims that the vomiting and dizziness that some people experience while watching Pokemon is "proof" that Pokemon is Satanic. It's called 'epilepsy', Jacobs, and according to http://www.cptech.org/ip/wto/p6/msf052003.pdf, there were 1.4 million people who suffer from it in 1996.   She then claims that Pokemon "encourages" its players to cheat using the GameShark - a cheating device for those who don't know. This indicates lack of knowledge on her part. First of all, the GameShark is not a Pokemon phenomenon; you can cheat on almost any videogame. Secondly, I rather doubt that cheating on a videogame is proof of "bad morals" on the part of the gamer.  Jacobs concludes her Pokemon section by citing an instance when a fourteen year old Pokemon fan assaulted someone in his high school in order to obtain a Pokemon. Since when, exactly, has the bad behavior of one teenager reflected on an entire franchise? That's like saying that ALL Christians are responsible for the dishonest practices of televangelists like the Bakkers and Robert Tilton.  The section covering Harry Potter contains similar bad logic. Jacobs cites a quote from a young fan of Harry Potter who claims that they want to "become a witch", thereby reasoning that the entire Harry Potter franchise must be evil because of the acts of one fan.   She also concludes that Harry Potter "must" be evil because it is about witchcraft. The Bible contains historical accounts of entire civilizations being eliminated and many other violent subjects, but that doesn't mean that anyone who reads the Bible is murderous. It means that the Bible happens to contain violent passages.  Jacobs is supposed to prove conclusively that Harry Potter, Pokemon, Magic cards, and other trendy fads are Satanic, but I think that her arguments are quite weak. She more proves that these fads are NOT Satanic than she does prove that they are+books
Best of the 4-Volume Set but....+N+This is the best starting book for anyone who wants to delve into hypnosis. But it is often available as used book only and is the first in a 4-vol set. But soon (sometime in early 2006), there will be a 8-vol (yes, 8 books in a set) set in a single CD that also comes with audio and bonus video and at $75!  Back about this book... It tells you experiments and findings of tests conducted on hypnotized subjects and how they react to suggestions by the "hypnotizer" and also what happens when they are told to do things (while in trance) that they would not do in normal consciousness.    The sections on Trance and Suggestions are excellent; perhaps the best OVERVIEW of trance and how suggestions work.  Much of the material is suitable for a hypnotherapist to use in a pre-talk to trance induction+books
Save Your Money+N+Brian Hinton's Both Sides Now is a complete disaster.  What could have been a promising biography of Mitchell is instead a garbled mess.  Indeed, Hinton's text is relatively void of biographical information.  Rather,  Hinton relies on a handfull of interviews published of Mitchell's, and he  quotes from them in such large chunks that the reader would be the wiser to  check out the interviews from their sources.  Following a brief, and  flawed, biographical section, Hinton uses the rest of the text as a forum  for his interpretations of Mitchell's work.  Album by album, song by song,  Hinton gives his own personal commentary on Mitchell's music so that the  text ends up reading like a diary of Hinton's own personal reflections.   Moreover, Hinton's analysis of Mitchell's songs are sometimes so off-base  and confusing that the reader is left wondering how he comes to these  conclusions.  Finally, his constant personal comments in the text make it  seen like nothing more than a high school writing assignment+books
Should be in the fiction-horror section+N+Well, I am not financed by any right wing think tank (but if there's a think tank out there that wants to finance me--right or left--, give me a call!), but forty years ago Ehrlich was predicting massive global starvation in the 1990's.  Well, I went throught the 90's and I don't really recall that.  If you're looking for a scary but fictional story, read Steven King...or Paul Ehrlich I guess.  But let's not pretend that this has anything to do with reality. +books

Interesting, valid, and not so controversial+P+Based on the rejection of the &quot;hypodermic&quot; theory of advertising, the idea that we are not hapless victims is something most students of media will here about.  Propaganda is not as powerful as we  believe, but our own desire to buy is very powerful.     His views on the  negativity of our consumerism are what make him and his work so different+books
A WONDERFUL BOOK  FOR ALL AGES+P+Al Capone Does My Shirts is a fiction story about a boy, Matthew Flannegan "Moose" and his family who live on Alcatraz. Moose is faced with many challenges throughout his childhood including having to take care of his older sister, Natalie, who has autism. Whatever the challenge though moose always finds a way to over come it.  This book is wonderful for all ages- children and adults. I highly recommend this book to people who like to read books that have many adventures.  Gennifer Choldenko is an amazing author and I plan on reading more of her books. IF i loved it you probably will too. +books
Prophetic Visionary+P+This work is a testiment to Chester Himes' brilliant insight and characterstic of the schitzophrenic relationship most extremely talented black artists have had with America.  Much praised for his urban crime series, his more politically charged work was often ignored.  This book and the truths it reveals about America's ability and inclination to create entire groups of people with nothing to lose speaks volumes about today's society as it did when written by the author.  Many who read this will be afraid, as well they should.  You will be entertained none-the-less, and hopefully inspired to think. The ending leaves something to be desired, I suspect that is because Mr. Himes was not alive to complete it himself+books
Another Treasure+P+This much anticipated 2nd title for O'Brien is also full of truly solid encouragement of character for every little hero ready to defend his castle.  Garland's genius is remarkable!  On the second page, his awesome illustration is SOOO designed for little boys!   The only drawback of this book is that it includes the father quite a bit, where I'd Be Your Princess left the mother out.  I was expecting this book to be the ideal title for single mothers, but I'm afraid it must be designed with a whole family unit in mind.  I wholeheartedly recommended it anyhow, because God is the Father to the fatherless, and the relationship between the boy and his father can easily be examined that way! Good for mothers and sons of all ages+books
Power to the People+P+My initial interest in the book was a result of an accident. I stumbled upon a television program where 2 guys in suits are being interviewed in a park. The comparisons between a Starfish and I spider compelled me to purchase the book. Simply stated, The Starfish and the Spider is an excellent book.  Management styles and corporate culture are not spellbinding topics, however the authors present the subject matter clearly with historical and present day references. I use Craigslist and could easily relate to the sense of community.  This book is a must read for those in business brick n' mortar or an internet based; for those with a desire to understand how a college student, with an idea for sharing music, brought an industry to it's knees+books
Formulaic+N+I was bored - really bored, which is why I picked this book to read from the free book trade shelves at work.  It has a good basic story but is so formulaic that I was able to predict the ending after the second or third chapter.  Being a medical professional, it was difficult to read about procedures that are outdated now and remember when they were cutting edge.  Perhaps it's also a bit scary to remember those I've worked with in the past who have had the same narcissistic outlooks.    I think I'll pass up the other books by Dr. Cook that I have not read as of  yet.  This is the second one of his that, in my opinion, bombed miserably+books
Maudlin, skip it+N+This book was very disappointing, and quite frankly depressing for a new mother. My least favorite part was when the mother told the son you had better get here quick, and the image of him rocking what may be a dying mother was a little too much. There are sentimental stories, but this is just plain maudlin.+books
Short, complex, informative+P+I'm shocked at the negative reviews this book has received.  I found it to be a brilliant introduction to an incredibly complex thinker and person.  Far from bashing Jefferson for his views on blacks and women, Appleby apologizes for him, and basically agrees with her negative reviewers here that we should not judge an eighteenth century figure by twentieth century standards.  Appleby has a remarkable feel for the politics of the early Republic, and does a brilliant job of recreating for a modern reader exactly what the Federalists and the Democratic-Republicans were fighting over.  She makes a strong case that Jefferson stood for democracy, against elitist opponents who sought to exclude common people from voting.  The core of her argument is that Jeffersonian republicanism is at the heart of our modern conception of democracy, and that both contemporary political parties -- the Democratic and the Republican -- draw equally on his legacy.  An important argument to remember in these partisan times, and it gives us hope that we can overcome our current profound divisions+books
Hate to Give it One Star+N+Is there an option for zero.  The worst I book I have ever read.  He contradicts himself in his points, hoovers over stealing pears (and other evil things) and puts me to sleep.  I don't see how this piece of garbage could make anyone a saint, it should be burned. ZERO STARS+books
bad book+N+I was very disapointed. The Reason manuel is 10 times better. I went back reading Reason 2.5 power by Michael Prager.Gonna buy his version of 3.0.Should have done it in the first place+books
Extremely Useful+P+Useful and worthy book for anyone wanting to practice the 12 steps in their life+books
Systematic Theology is an Outstanding Theological Work+P+To be quite frank with you, I was simply going to come online and recommend that you do not buy the abridged version, but make certain that you are getting the full, unabridged 4 volume set.  However, I was surprised at reading one review which makes a comparison to Monty Python.  That reviewer also suggested that Chafer's approach was for a believer to check their mind at the door of a church before entering.   I must admit, I have no idea where this person is coming from.  Chafer has one of the most careful, logical and systematic approaches to theology that I have ever read (and I have a huge library).  I know of several pastors whose ministry was changed profoundly because of this one book.  There is nothing anti-intellectual about Chafer's approach; there is nothing which is dumbed-down.  Bear in mind, this is a 4 volume set.  My abridged version is about 1000 pages.  In particular, Chafer's approach to the Angelic Conflict is exemplary.   I have only one criticism, and that is with the abridged version: somethimes, a point will be made which is true, but the Scripture quoted is not directly on point.  I do not know if that is the fault of Chafer or the fault of the abridged text.   My recommendation is, if you are going to own just one book (or set of books) which cover nearly the entire realm of doctrine, this should be it.+books
Abner Kneeland+N+To prove America is a Christian nation David Barton cites the little known blasphemy conviction of Abner Kneeland. During the 1830s Kneeland,a former Universalist turned pantheist, was sentenced to sixty days in a Boston jail for ridiculing the deity of Christ. Barton cites Commonwealth v. Abner Kneeland as example of how early American jurisprudence defended Christianity.   Either David Barton is a sloppy scholar or he is a man with a scary agenda. Does Barton believe that state governments should have the power to jail people for stating religious opinions contrary to his? Why else would he cite the Kneeland case?   Kneeland should only be a curious anachronism, not a legal precedent.  +books
Why was this book written?+N+I finally found the book that should never have been written. The book was given to me, so I tried to read it.  Why would anyone waste their time comparing Tom Clancy's novel hero against real life presidents and presidental polices?  I have concluded that the author must be jealous of Clancy's success and thought he could make a little money writing a book comparing a fictitious character virsus real presidental policy. This book really deserved a minus star+books
A great grounding in the knowledge of electric car conversion+P+I have an interest in all environmental solutions, but from a more technical side and I was searching for an economical mode of transport, which could also be an ongoing project for the future months. "Convert It" is a great read and it really shows you the basic rules and tips in both technical detail but in a user friendly layout. I would recommend it as a great starting block and as an essential library piece for any future electric car-converting enthusiast+books
Another adult hooked on this supposed kids' series+P+For the Terry Pratchett fans out there, nothing more need be said. It's Pratchett, you want to read it, the only reason you've been hesitating is because it's marked as a kids book (juvenile, young adult...) But this one isn't just for kids. As with any Pratchett book, there are layers and layers, and some of them wouldn't be obvious to kids at all.  For example, kids who have only seen the Batman movies, and not the original TV show, will miss it entirely when Mrs. Tachyon is saying "dinner, dinner, dinner, dinner..." and continues a few more times between interruptions, finally ending with "dinner, dinner, Batman!" which is where adults (at least my generation) will realize she's not saying dinner, she's humming the theme song. Also, kids the age of our protagonists, 13 or so, may not recognize the "red shift" when they get to it; that's usually covered a bit later in the science curriculum, such as college physics.  The protagonists are Johnny, and his friends Wobbler (who wobbles), Bigmac (who is large), and Yo-less, who is apparently the only black in Blackbury who doesn't say yo. They are joined in this book by Kirsty/Kasandra (she changes her name each week), who is hyper-intelligent and socially even more inept than the others. Each of this team has his own strange store of skills or knowledge. These talents turn out to have entirely different implications when travelling in time than they do in their own time. Bigmac's car-stealing abilities (which some parents may object to in a kids' book) turn out to be impaired when trying to steal a car that doesn't have power steering and power brakes. On the other hand, Yo-less's lack of cool is suddenly changed when he puts on period clothing and suddenly looks, as Johnny says, as though he plays the saxophone in a band. Yo-less does, though get exposed to the more primitive social prejudices of 1941, as does Kasandra. And Bigmac finds out that the skinhead symbols and attitudes that he wears only as a social item suddenly have real meaning, and it's not pleasant. OK, there's a bit of a moral or two snuck in here, about thinking about what things mean. There is also at least one moral that readers one and all will ignore, just as the characters do, about following advice (and about giving it).   Johnny has been working on his World War II project for school since the previous book, "Johnny and the Dead." One of the funny bits in the book is how, whenever a kid claims he's doing "a project," he winds up with all sorts of information that is unsuitable for kids, and/or hitherto classified or secret; the remembered horror of school projects makes all the adults give in so that they don't have to think about it any more!  Other reviewers have described much of the plot, so I won't repeat it here. One thing that some readers may wish to note about this plot is that it isn't just time travel, it's alternate history as well, and for kids this may serve as an introduction to the whole sub-genre of alternate history. Meanwhile, some of the high points: * Mrs. Tachyon's cat, Guilty - and his tastes in food. * The ice that forms on the characters during their last-minute rush for the air-raid siren. * The importance of pickles.  The series has no noticeable sexual content, and no real bad language; the most dangerous things in it for young readers are the ideas, which may make them *gasp* think! It may also make them lifelong Pratchett addicts. In the opinion of an existing Pratchett addict, there's nothing at all wrong with that+books
Love for a Lifetime: Building a Marriage That Will Go the Distance+N+I found this book to not only be shallow and poorly written, but also insidiously demeaning to women. Rather than focusing on the individual strengths and weaknesses men and women bring to relationships, the author focused on the weakness and instability of women. In addition, his examples and analogies were often misplaced and poorly devised... certainly not illustrative of his points or of a healthy marriage. I found the content much too general with overuse of stereotypes. My fiancee and I have read Chapman's Five Love Languages and got a great deal more out of that exercise+books
Fascinating!+P+As I am a scholar and an expert of Na-Dene groupings, I find this to be one of the most fascinating and remarkable volumes of THE HANDBOOKD OF NORTH AMERICAN INDIANS.  The photos and linguistic data are absolutely  fascinating and the authentic information -that so captivates every  micro-molecule of my attention- is astonishingly elating!  I have recently  been able to determine -thanks to the many rare and authentic photos of  this book- that many of the Northern 'Athapaskan' tribes are not totally  'mongoloid', as I had previoiusly surmised.  I have discovered  Indian  (from 'India') and Turkish  strains that are especially, concentrated in  northeastern British Columbia and northwestern-Northwest Territory bands.   These findings have shed much light on my Na-Dene origin theories,  regarding the genetic makeup of the Na-Dene forbears.  AWESOME!!+books
The BEST book on chronic pain I've found.+P+I've lived with chronic pain for 2 1/2 years as a result of a car accident  which left me with Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy.  This book addresses  issues that apply to all kinds of chronic pain.  It is practical and easy  to understand.  I've bought many, many books on chronic pain, and this is  by far the best.  I believe this approach to living with chronic pain is  realistic, positive and allows the sufferer to make the most of his/her  life.  The book relates very well to the psychological effects of living  with chronic pain.  This physical and psychological program allows the  sufferer to take back control over his pain and his life.  If you or a  loved one suffer from chronic pain, this book is a must+books
The Quest of the Historical Jesus+N+I found this to be excruciatingly boring. The material is at best obsolete and of little value. A waste of time and money and not appropriate to one searching for a history of Jesus+books
Triumph of Big Business marketing+N+Reagan began his acting career reading cue-cards in the service of General Electric during his stint at the "GE Playhouse."  Reagan's move to the White House had him doing much the same, reading cue-cards written for him by Big Business, including GE, a weapons and energy conglomerate that owns NBC. If people want to get a good feel for the Reagan administration, I'd recommend the books of Michael Parenti, who documents the legacy of dirty wars in Latin America and the global class war that is turning our planet into a dystopia of haves and have-nots.  Globalized "Reaganomics" (aka, neoliberalism) is  creating a planet of slums and prisons, war and ecocide.  The parts of government that served the general public are being shredded, while the entitlement programs of war profiteers and various robber barrons create record profits. It's interesting to see the reverence Kim Jong Reagan receives; but whether people like him or not is immaterial, he wasn't in charge of the country.  Rather, very rich and powerful corporate executives and an army of lawyers and lobbyists entrenched themselves during the Reagan administration.  This corporate coup is something that many presidents have warned us about, including President Martin Van Buren who said, "I am more than ever convinced of the dangers to which the free and unbiased exercise of political opinion - the only sure foundation and safeguard of republican government - would be exposed by any further increase in the already overgrown influence of corporate authorities." If people can break-away from the Reagan illusion, and want to learn about real power in this country, I'd recommend the DVD "The Corporation," and the books and radio show of Thom Hartmann.+books
A comic gem!+P+'The Dog of the South' is a perfect novel. This sounds like hyperbole. It is short; there is very little in the way of plot; the characters do not develop in any way: yet the book is as engaging and entertaining as anything I have ever read. Before embarking on my second reading (just a fortnight after I finished my first) I planned to write down my favourite lines from the book. I gave up because I was transcribing almost the entire novel. No synopsis can do it justice. Ray Blount, Jr. has said of this book that 'no-one should die without reading it.' I'm with him all the way+books
Not a feel good parenting memoir+P+In our house we call somebody like Rachel a Whineramer. She really knows how to complain. But she writes so well, you don't care.  She had one passage where she describes the ideal (and unlikeliness) of the baby bottle coming out of the sterilizer, getting filled and passing to the baby's mouth without being contaminated. Funny stuff.  I found the book to be empowering. I felt as a parent, I was just a little better than she was. That is her gift. Like Jesus, Rachel crucifies herself as a crummy mother so that the rest of us can feel OK about ourselves+books
Not very inspired+N+After reading about half of this book, I had to stop.  I am not very inspired.  In fact, it had the opposite effect on me.  A lot of the stories I read were too much about the hardships and not enough about the positive outcomes that people had.  Kind of scared me a bit..is this what I have to look forward to as the years progress?  I was more inspired by Montel's book (once I got past the ego part of it)+books
Looking for something similar?+P+I love this book! It plays, quite successfully, with Douglas Adams's idea/question of what happens to gods when people stop believing in them? If you like this book you will also enjoy "The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul" by Douglas Adams and "American Gods" by Pratchett's friend Neil Gaimen (though this one is darker and gritty - exploring some of the less flattering parts of America).  "Good Omens" by Pratchett and Gaimen is a comedy about the end of the world. If you like the first three books I listed here you will like that one too.+books
What is this racist crap?+N+I had a 3 day detention to serve, 90 min's after each school day, so I went to the library originally looking for a book on engenering. I saw this instead, and decided to rent it out.  When I got in the car, I noticed the table of content's had several racial comment's in the front, but I ignored it. After reading a few CH. I couldnt beleive this book, but I kept reading it, cause it was entertaining how much of an idiot Chuck D is. He is the reason some white people have negative veiw's of black people. Because he play's the role of a loser who blaims everything on the same people that put him where he is now. Why not just bite the hand that feed's you? If you are in the black Panther's, are obsessed with Chuck D, or just straight up hate white people I would suggest this book. The real reason I hate this book is I despise anyone who makes racist comment's against anyone at any time, and against any race. I myself am white, and there was 3 race riot's where I grew up, I got stabbed in 5th grade by a black kid my age, and my father was murdered before I was born by a black man... So why don't I just write a book against " My oppressor's ". This book show's that Chuck D is truely not a smart man, just a racist fool, who is no more smart then Flavor Flav. He need's to go back to first grade, and watch more barney, so he can learn to love everyone. But I guess he is just going to get his, ironically like his song " Your gonna get your's ". I can not express in word's how much I hate this book, and I feel ashamed for every buying It takes a nation..+books
Best engineering text on statistics+P+The third edition has been improved but has the same practical feel as earlier editions.  Real data is used for most examples and having the "entire book" on a CDROM including the data sets, solution manual and supplimental material puts this text "over the top" in terms of usefulness.  It is an excellent reference for the practical engineer who uses statistics only occasionally.  I use this in industry and teach internal (to the company) courses using this text.  The CDROM really makes it the text of choice+books
Disappointing book and code on audio signal processing+N+This book is simply hideous, and if the rating system would let me give it zero stars I would do just that. The text will not enlighten you if you do not understand audio signal processing, and if you already do understand it, nothing will be added to your knowledge. The only thing worthwhile about the book is the table of contents, since it does act as an outline of the subjects you should know, in order, if you intend to learn about digital audio signal processing. Following this table of contents as a guide, you should learn about psychoacoustics, digital signal processing in general, analysis & synthesis of sound, user interface methods, and finally effects specific to sound and compression methods if you wish to call yourself knowledgeable of audio signal processing. Unfortunately, you will learn none of that from this book. Instead, what you get is a sort of wandering novel consisting of the author's memoirs and musings on signal processing subjects. There are virtually no instructive diagrams, no equations, no pseudocode, just page after page of conversational text. Sure, I grant you that the author talks about subjects that I have not found in other texts, but that is part of the whole problem- he just chatters on incessantly about these subjects without being the least bit instructive. Some authors who write useless texts at least include source code on their CD's that partially make up for their lack of talent as writers/instructors. In this case you shall have no such luck. The code is one monolithic ball of lint so deeply entrenched in windows-specific MFC code that it is virtually impossible to unravel. There are no comments to speak of to enlighten you as to what is going on in any of the code. Instead the reader will find comments such as "i suggest somebody to fix that" and "saves typing later".  If you do want to learn about digital audio processing, you might want to take a tip from the table of contents and start with psychoacoustics and pick up the excellent "Music, Cognition, and Computerized Sound: An Introduction to Psychoacoustics" by Perry Cook, which is good enough for self-study. For DSP for the music-centric reader, try "A Digital Signal Processing Primer : With Applications to Digital Audio and Computer Music" by Ken Steiglitz- it is very instructive, has plenty of equations and diagrams, and reads like a novel. Next, for analysis and synthesis of sound, find a copy of "Musical Applications of Microprocessors" by Hal Chamberlain. It was written in 1985, but it is an excellent introduction to sound analysis and synthesis in general and has a very good section on digital filters specific to audio. These three volumes should get you on your way to saying you understand digital audio processing. If you are a more advanced reader, read the two excellent volumes by Udo Zolzer- "Digital Audio Signal Processing" and "DAFX"- in that order.+books
Thank God It's Over!+N+The only reason I finished this book was it was a book club pick - I read a lot and it takes a really bad book for me to quit. This book is just never ending - no plot and a useless read. I can't believe so many people are giving it a good review. The constant narrative sounded like a neat way to write but it turned out very exhausting to read. Don't bother+books
Geared more towards parents than teens+P+My son saw my copy of "Yes, Your Teen is Crazy" (which was an excellent book by the same author.)  I thought this book would be geared more towards teens--as I planned on giving it to my son to read--to understand why parents act the way they do.  However, it was not written for a teenager.  It was very similar to the "...Teen is Crazy" book. +books
Give Me a Break!+N+This is frustrating to write actually. When will the public demand a real full featured autobiography of the Hells Angels rather than run from one loose lipped so called biker expert a la Yves Lavignes and not to stand up and honourable Angel himself. The public needs to read the real deal on what makes this a club versus a gang. This is a big boys club and they all work hard and party hard. These so-called authors make the club out to be nothing but murderers, drug dealers, rapists, and extortionists...however, a quick glance through any newspaper clearly prints in black and white the people we should be concerned about whn it comes to our safety and privacy are none other than police officers themselves. Remeber the boggeyman your parents warned you about and you grew up to realize the boogeyman didn't exist? Well, same goes to the Hells Angels in regards to the outright idiotic lies that have long fueled media hype and lined the budgets of the most corrupt police forces in big cities across Canada and the U.S. At the end of a day, whether your a biker or an accountant, nobody likes a rat. Anyhow, save your money and get the [...] for the bigger picture+books
Witty and Thought Provoking+P+The Duet was a fun book to read. It included the kind of writing I enjoy; real and coversational. All through the book, I felt like I had known these people for years and were talking to them in my own living room.

No other book recreates the pop atmosphere of the times+P+The intimate stories of the cultural changes that represented the 1950s are told by one who was at the center of the storm: Andy Warhol. In his studio, the Factory, he created large canvases of what came to define Pop Art, listened to music which reflected a radical new generation's energy, and remained at the hub of the avant garde. No other book recreates the pop atmosphere of the times - and any reader of 1960s history and culture must have it.  Diane C. Donovan California Bookwatc+books
Bad Bunk+N+I have just a very few words to say about this not too inventive construct " Its undeniably the most implausible book i've ever read on any subject " +books
ABOUT GEOGRAPHY OF THE AREA+P+The author of the chapter 1- Robert H.Heusen is sincere at p.2 saying that other local ethnicities were indigeneous to the area where Armenia was established much later-e.g.the Khaldeans,the Urartians etc.;that ancient authors wrote about it clearly.I would add that Strabo in the Ic.wrote in his Geography of the World that the Armenian political unit was created by a certain general of the army of another country on the land snatched from the Iberians/Moskhians; this is in vol 5 of Strabo,the Loeb Classical Library edition in 1936;this is the area where the Republic of Armenia was created in 1918.I recently learned that its name was planned to be 'Republic of Erevan'(not Armenia) and the League of the Nations promised to the government of Kartu i.e. Georgia that the creation of Armenia in Caucasia was a temporary measure-F.Nansen from that League of the Nations desired to create some footing somewhere in the world for refugees driven out from the Balkans and that soon the League of the Nations would move the Republic of Armenia and her Armenian and other refugees-unwanted citizens of Turkey-to the Mediterranean.These facts are known from materials published by F. Nansen available in English and some translated into Russian now on the web.The creation of that republic and that of Azerbaijan in 1918 in the area was the gross violation of the human rights of the indigeneous nation called by several names:the Iberians,the Moskhians,the Kardi etc. R.Heusen is absolutely right in telling readers that even before World War I,the Armenians were a minority in what became the Republic of Armenia in 1918.After reading those truthful remarks it was a sad surprise to me to see on the next page "a map of the historical Armenia" encompassing greater territory than the Great Britain.R.Heusen wrote the former was 238,000 square miles against 228,000 square miles of the latter.The term Armenian Plateau is frequently used by the author.It is unwelcome as other names were usually used for that plateau.Moses Khorenatsi is discussed at several pages.It is over two centuries that he is widely denounced for being a fictitious author and therefore called Pseudo-Moses Khorenatsi.I have thoroughly researched materials on that author in publications,in unpublished archives of Prof.Mikheil Tamarashvili known as Michele Tamarati in Rome and Paris.Many authors in XIX century revealed the absurdity of the writings attributed to him:among them Mr.Lenormann,Ilia Chavchavadze criticised that pseudo author and his promoters from the Mkhitarist congregation in Venice- Western Europe for spreading false information.'Gate of Alans' (p.152)usually has a better term in historical sources:the Gate of Aragvi.Metsamor mentioned at p.49 is the distorted term from Kartu term 'Metsamuli' meaning 'Cherry colour'-as nearby clyffs are reddish with minerals.This Kartu/Kartuli designation was given to those clyffs,the nearby village and the river by ethnic Kartu population millenia ago before aliens-Armenians among them-immigrated to that area-some as refugees,others as invaders accompanying alien armies.Authors of this book mention a huge number of writings of persons- including the ancient Persians,Greeks,Romans,Kartu(Shota Rustaveli,History of Kartly,Dionysius the Areopagite,Georgian Chronicle(p.242);myriad of modern authors and those of XIX-XX cc.The book is clearly addressed to modern young ethnic Armenians and teach them that they are entitled not only to what was made the Republic of Armenia in 1918(itself an abuse of the human rights of another-indigeneous nation that has created a kingdom including the territory of that area in much early days),but to the region'greater than the Great Britain'.Still I give to the authors of this book 'excellent', i.e. 5 stars- for excellent misinformation+books
A Deceiving Title+N+This sounds like an ideal book for a person with an eating disorder.  But it heaps loads of guilt and condemnation on an already needy and suffering soul.  The idea that over or undereating is sin is one concept.  But the fact is that the individuals embroiled in this cannot help themselves. They are already people pleasers and perfectionists, how can telling them the whole problem is because they are sinners be of help? They are already as good as they can get themselves to be. They are not bad--they are hurt and afraid. It has been said no one can overcome an eating disorder without the help of a therapist.  This I believe.  There are too many important issues involved in this DISEASE to dismiss it as sin.  If the person knew the issues they would be a long way to getting help. God loves these dear ones and understands the enormity of their situation and their pain. These are very good people. Heaping more condemnation on one beset with self-loathing is surely not the path to freedom.  Adding God's displeasure to this already mountainous pile of self hate can only be damaging--perhaps pushing some over the edge.  A good book to avoid!!+books
Way too scattered+N+The topic is good but the author crams way too much reporting into the book rather than concentrating on a few chosen stories of families on the home front. +books

A peek inside the process+N+Seeing a few of the unrealistically rave reviews of this flawed novel reminds me to remind everyone how tainted the amazon reader review process is.  When anyone can review a book there's the chance that the authors publicist, best friend, next-door-neighbor, and even mother can write a glowing review.  I'm always suspicious of "best novel ever" reviews..+books
If an irrational populist ran a non-profit agency+N+This book is neither about Aristotle nor General Motors.  Do not be fooled into believing it is in any way an application of Aristotelian ethics in modern business; it is not.  Morris consistently contradicts Aristotle throughout the book.    An example is Morris' proselytizing conclusion that leadership requires humility.  To make his point Morris quotes ancient Hasidic verse and the Tao Te Ching to establish that we are all worms.  Nobility, Morris suggests, is lowness.  Did Aristotle ever say this? No.  Could Aristotelian writing lead us to these conclusions?  No again.  Is Taoism consistent with Aristotelian reason and logic?  No, no, no.  Is Hasidic verse? Definitely not.  So what is going on?  Did Morris forget to read Aristotle?  Aristotle understood Man as a rational being with happiness as the moral purpose of his life.  Morris does not.  This book does not.  Morris peppers his book with quotes at the furious rate of no less than one or two per page.  He quotes every thing from fortune cookies to Einstein.  Ironically with all this mad quoting he never once, ever, (I checked) quotes Aristotle - never.     This book could better be titled, "If an irrational populist ran a non-profit organization."     The prefaces of basic economic texts usually contain better discussions of the practical intersection of business and philosophy.+books
This book really upset my daughter+N+My daughter's kindergarten teacher read this book to them in class today and they also made an adorable craft of the old lady with cut outs of all of the animals which fit into her apron.  I thought it was so cute and hung it on our fridge.  Soon after I noticed that my daughter was acting upset, when I asked her what was wrong she broke down sobbing about how the old lady dies in the end of the song.  I haven't seen her this upset about anything in a long time.  Even after I explained to her that it was just a story and not real  she still was upset for the rest of the night.  I know that death is a topic that we all need to discuss with our children, but I'm not sure that this is the appropriate way to deal with it.  I have removed the craft that she made so she doesn't need to be reminded of it.  I know that there are a few children in her class who have lost grandparents this year and it just seems like maybe this book could bring up sad feelings for them as well+books
Ok, an adverb...brilliantly+P+Daniel Handler is just one of the more vivid fiction writers out there. It's great to see him show his adult side with this collection of short stories which seek to explore his forays outside of Snicketville. I love the story where the character forces himself on the cabbie. Read this one by the pool this weekend. I'd love to see him write a non-Lemony novel, too+books

Broken Hearted Mom+N+This book is a total joke. My daughter and I had several sessions with Frances Firman Solario. She ruined my family. Frances Firman Solario did not encourage forgiveness like she writes in her book. She cast both mother and daughter against one another. My daughter and I were on better terms before we started seeing Frances Firman Solario. My daughter and I are no longer on speaking terms. My family is broken. I highly would NOT recommend this book or recommend that you use Frances Firman Solario as a therapist.+books
Encyclopedia of Feng Shui+N+I am certainly agreed with &quot; a reader from San Francisco&quot;. I have almost all of Lilian Too's Feng Shui Books and a recently bought her EoFS. I have found her recent publications are nothing, but just a  repetition of her previous books. Certainly a great disappointment from a  master! Please Lilian  don't published just for the sake of publishing+books
This cannot be for real.+N+I am a black woman who happens to be dating a white man.  However, when I first came across this book a few years ago, I was offended and frankly, shocked that something this blatantly racist and disrespectful could have been printed under the guise of a self-help book.  Whoever the author may be, s/he must realise that the way to make a rational argument to the intended reading audience of black females is NOT to insult black men, who represent her brothers, her father or her friends.  Another review on this board took the words right out of my mouth, when it stated that historically, it has been white-not black men-who have perpetuated the myth of the black [...], and who have been heavily invested in creating a sexually degraded image of the black woman in order to justify his sexual exploitation of her.  Half of me believes [or wants to believe] that this book is actually a satire.  I hope one day to have my hopes confirmed!+books
sort of cheating+N+This book is exactly the same as "Handbook of Technical Writing" by same authors. The only difference is in the cover picture and colors. I think it is not a cool thing to sell the same book with two names without mentioning it. So if you have that one, do not buy this one. They are exactly the same+books
Actually, this book is terrible+N+I just picked up the guitar again -- I played guitar briefly, and very badly, years ago -- and was hoping for a quick refresher course and a little more. This book, alas, is just terrible. The organization is illogical and confusing, important topics are given very short shrift while unimportant stuff fills page after page. Most of the book could charitably be called filler. The book is terrible as a reference book as well; useful stuff like scales and chord diagrams are scattered about the book, and many of the diagrams are hard to make sense of. (He doesn't even explain the correct tuning for the guitar until page 170, in a section on how to play slide guitar -- I had to look it up on the internet.) I chucked the CD into the trash. For scales, I found "The Ultimate Scale Book" to be about a zillion times better.+books
Confusing and long-winded+N+This was the first of Ms. Peters' books that I read.  Maybe if I had had the background of the other books, I would have found it more interesting.  As it was, I kept thinking "Get on with it already". There were too many exceprts about Nefret and her hubby and then it would switch back to Peabody and Emerson, and it rarely went back to the murder. When it did, there were so many characters and so many nicknames for characters that I was totally confused and often had to go back in the book to see who was who. The setting in this book and Peabody's wit kept me reading, though. +books
Money Better Spent Elsewhere...+N+Overall, an 'OK' read, but teaches human sexuality as though his audience was a grade-six sex education class as rather than mature-minded adults.  This book is extremely simplistic and vague, and tends to lean towards a more dellusional depiction of human sexuality, often confining it to the contexts of outmodded biblical principles and male-dominated patriarchy.  Lacking modern approach and intimate sensuality, I would sincerely hope that this book is not a reflection of poor Tim's seemingly mechanical sex life!!  I would not recommend this book unless you are totally ignorant and clueless about what sex is all about.  I would suggest looking elsewhere for a more relevant guide to sexual intimacy+books
Could we now please have the version she meant to print? +N+This may be a bit of spoiler but I was completly dissappointed in the end of this book/trilogy.  I could not understand how she was going to wrap up so many story lines in last few pages of the book and then I learned.  I felt I was reading the end of a story witten by a parent trying to rush their children to bed.  After three books I had invested a great deal of time into these characters and story lines.  To wrap them up so hasty, with such outragouse coincidence and neatness did not do justice to what otherwise was a very thoughtful series of books.  +books
Very disappointing+N+I hate this book. All the book is the repetition of the same code with very, very few differences. The description lets argue that is pointed to advanced users but the content is so basic that is hard to believe. It uses SOAP in it's more basic fashion. The code is poor (also the HTML and the Javascript used). The code is written in a so invesive fashion that if you strip it (and is not a bad idea), you will find no more than 30 pages. The Multi-Tier is just supposed to be good and misuesed. As you may understand, I strongly advise to not buy this book+books
Very disappointing unless you're in the (junior) target demographic+N+If you are a teenager or student in your early 20s and are fascinated with the big mysterious world of I-Banking, this book is for you. It starts from ground zero and provides a cursory explanation of what investment banking is, along with some guidance on career paths in the field.  If you are anyone else, forget it. As I struggled to maintain interest, I couldn't help but be reminded of a scene from the movie "Back to School", where Paxton Whitehead plays a B-school professor lecturing his class on how to start a business and Rodney Dangerfield plays a veteran businessman with no formal education. As Whitehead's character is pontificating about the nuances of how global interest rates affect the construction costs that a hypnothetical business will incur, Dangerfield's character can't help but blurt out "Why in the world would you build when you can rent in this market for half a buck a square foot and let someone else have the headaches of property management?". It quickly becomes apparent that the real-world experience of Dangerfield's character is far more useful than the off-topic theoretical knowledge of the professor. This author reminds me of Whitehead's character: Thoroughly vetted in academia and obviously having zero experience in the real world, and thus having zero useful real-world insight to share with his readers.  The most-cited references in the chapter bibliographies are the annual reports of the big I-banks, and the rest of the book is written at the same naieve, glossy-overview level.  In summary, if you want to know what it's like to serve in the Navy, you can get yourself a copy of the Navy's glossy brochure on what Navy careers are supposed to be like, or you can find a vet who's been in the Navy to tell you what it's really like. Reading this book is like reading the Navy's glossy brochure.+books
Good start to what promises to be a fun series+P+Wanda Nell Culpepper has got a lot on her hands:  she's a single mom with three kids and one grandkid who she works 2 jobs to support.  Her Mother in Law is a monster--and her ex has just shown up waving around a lot of cash.    When Wanda Nell finds her ex stabbed through the throat with a pink lawn flamingo, her troubles have just begun.  The deputy suspects her, dangerous folks are coming after her looking for something that the ex supposedly left with her.   "Flamingo Fatale" is a good read and an interesting cosy; however, I don't think that Evans hits her stride with her first book.  "Murder Over Easy" is much improved and the third in the series actually promises to be more interesting.+books
A great dual biography - one of the best!+P+Yes, I realize that Nesta Webster believed in conspiracy theories but that does not take away from the balanced perspective of this excellent biography, one of the few dual biographies of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. I believe that the royal couple needs to be studied as a unit in order to be understood. Too many other biographies focus on one, at the other's expense. The emphasis of this book, on the years before the Revolution, includes many details omitted by other works. It is refreshingly free of the Freudian bias infused by Zweig and so many others into the life of the king and queen. I wish this excellent book were more widely known; it is one of the best+books
Not even good science+N+I ordered this book hoping for some scientific evidence supporting what I already knew from personal experience; that there is a gestalt emerging from all of the beings in the universe. An emergent property that some call `the spirit that moves through all things' and some call `god' and I was hoping that this book would call it Gaia. Bah! The author totally ignores the metaphysical evidence and misrepresents the impact of civilization on the natural world. He also misrepresents the relationship tribal aka primitive cultures had with the natural world. Furthermore, this isn't even good science. Typically I pass books on to friends or trade them at a used bookstore. The best thing about this book was how easily the pages tore out to become kindling for my fire. If I could I would give it a negative rating -- don't pollute your mind with this trash+books
Appalling translation+N+The translation of this work is at best clumsy and frequently appalling.  As a previous reviewer notes much appears to have been carried out using, poorly, a dictionary.  Thus we have "knife" used to refer to what in English is commonly called a sabre.  The reason being (I assume) that the character used to describe the weapon commonly means knife.  Frequently, she has  chosen arcane language.  Thus we get "myrmidon" to describe a senior captain/bodyguard; the translater not appreciating that the term when used in English literature is either jocular or derogatory.  Some phrases and clauses are meaningless.  It all reflects badly on the editorial team at the Chinese University Press in Hong Kong and, unfortunately, tells one much about the standard of English here.   Where does this leave the reader?  Frankly, I cannot understand how anyone could give this book a high rating other than out of a desperate desire to read something of this genre.  The Deer and the Cauldron is far superior.  This book can only be recommended to somebody who is prepared to persevere with the translation out of an interest in martial arts literature+books
boring, more of the same +N+This is simply a rehash of Dr. Burns previous writings. If you have read Feeling Good, it is a waste of money to purchase this book. He covers the same material but change the names the scenerios. He is a one trick pony and clearly has done no more recent research , since the prior books+books
Vague, wordy, confusing, and in need of examples+N+I found that if you want to learn the language of auditing, have another reference handy.  Often, the discourse goes on and on and on and could really be distilled down into a sentence or two that had a firm and grounded presentation.  There were very few examples so it was difficult at best to try to understand the often high-level conceptual frameworks that were constantly being presented.  I also noted quite a few editing errors that probably arose from cut-and-pastes that were not carefully reviewed.  Also, figures and diagrams were reused and were not carefully reviewed either as information was present that didn't apply to the new scenario+books
U.S. Constitution hippocket book+P+The book arrived in good condition, and is indeed a hip-pocket sized book+books
Put this Bride Back on the shelf+N+I loved the original book &quot;The Sherbrooke Bride&quot;.  I have read all of the bride books and this is by far the worse.  The only reason I have given this book two stars is because it lets us know what has become of our favorite characters.  Otherwise, this book is a complete waste of time.  If you want to be thoroughly entertained I suggest reading the first book which happens to be about Alex and Douglass.  Skip the second for Ryder's story is so-so.  I would then read Sinjun's search for love.  It is very funny and captivating.  Ms. Coulter generally writes really good books.  She should have quit while she was ahead+books
Post Modern Authentic+P+Part way through the book, I paused and thought about these messed-up lives and unexpressed emotions, then it occurred to me that these guys are just like everyone I know.  To me, this is why I found the voices so authentic.  I am Vince's age and shared his attitude toward those of his father's generation.  There is little narration and much stream of conscious thinking which makes the book, at times, hard to follow.  Develop a score card of characters and relationships early since it does get confusing.  Ultimately the four stars are for the implicit language which limits the scope of the book somewhat.  Although the dialog is onviously authentic, I know that I missed some things since I am not from the neighborhood and the dialog almost assumes that a reader must be from nearby+books
This is a BOARD BOOK - you know the kind with pages thick and durable enough for your toddler to chew +P+I mention that this is a board book because so many parents seem dissapointed by how few pages it contains.    Your kids will still love it+books
good...but lacking. an incomplete edition.+N+While this story is truly an essential writing of Dostoevsky, it lacks the appropriate context to be read as sold in this copy.  If you are interested in reading "The Grand Inquisitor" without reading the rest of The Brothers Karamazov, I would recommend the Guignon edition, sold for only a little more.  This work includes the two chapters preceeding "The Grand Inquisitor" as well as what Dostoevsky intended as the refutation for this tale, "The Russian Monk," which follows this legend.  Dostoevsky did not intend for this to be separated from the book as a whole, but I think it could be legitimately done when read with a little more context than is present in this copy.  Additionally, this alternate edition includes a very complete introduction by Charles Guignon, which is much more informative than the brief one by Anne Fremantle provided in this copy.  It is important to remember that "The Grand Inquistor" was not Dostoevsky's final answer in The Brothers Karamazov.  Reading this edition alone provides a flawed view of both Dostoevsky's writing and philosophy and The Brothers Karamazov.  I would recommend reading the book as a whole instead [and I particularly recommend the Pevear and Volokhonsky translation for that: it is much more accurate to the original Russian].  Or at a minimum, reading the other edition of this book.  Either way, you will get a more complete glimpse to the genius of Dostoevsky, which this fails to provide.  The Grand Inquisitor is truly an essential read, but not in this presentation of it+books
&quot;I have flown, Father. My son, I believe you.&quot;+P+BALTASAR AND BLIMUNDA is a wonderful, richly detailed account of life in early 18th century Portugal. It is a time when Portugal fought the ruthless French, maintained an important colony in Brazil, and was constantly under the threat of the Holy Inquisition. The King of Portugal, Dom Joao V, desperately wants an heir to the throne. One night he promises a Franciscan friar that if he can foretell a succession to the throne then he would build a convent in Mafra. After the Queen gives birth Dom Joao V fulfills his promise by building a convent that is destined to be the greatest in Portugal. Meanwhile, after losing his hand on the battlefield Baltasar travels to Lisbon where he eventually meets Blimunda while watching public executions of condemned individuals. An eccentric Padre Bartolomeu Lourenco recruits Baltasar and Blimunda to work in secret creating Passarola, a flying machine that resembles a giant bird. Centuries before the modern airplane is created, the act of flying is often beyond the comprehension of individuals and could be seen as a holy sign. The sections of this book detailing the plight of Passarola are most entertaining and fun. This creates a good balance with the harsh details of the building of the convent. Saramago succeeds in writing entire passages revealing how much work and sweat were involved in such acts as dragging a giant slab of marble a considerable distance. One might think these passages are dull and tedious, but I believe Saramago highlights these arduous aspects of life that are often ignored by other authors who create works of historical fiction. Throughout the years Saramago has solidified his reputation for being a wonderful storyteller who create novels that are both shocking and revealing of the human condition, and BASTASAR AND BLIMUNDA is no exception. Highly recommended+books
McGrath's Agnosticism???+N+Reading some reviews and the blurbs for this book one could be forgiven for thinking that McGrath has dealt a crushing blow to Dawkins. Far from it. What we actually have is a Christian Theologian basically answering Dawkins with 'Not in MY religion.' It is a defense of his own personal Christian beliefs and there is virtually no mention of other religions nor recognition of differences within Christianity itself.   McGrath makes an argument that we can only be agnostic yet only applies this to atheists and clearly not to himself and other Christians. He does not say what he believes about the many other gods and spirits etc humans believe or believed in though it is only possible to conclude that he must be an atheist where they are concerned.  There is a valid point he makes about the correlation between religious belief and health and well-being but this does not mean that religious belief is the cause of the health. If religious belief caused good health and well-being then, as the vast majority of people who have ever lived have had one religious belief or another, we would expect the world have always been overflowing with health etc. This is obvously not the case.  The only evidence offered for God is how nature makes us feel - nature being the pointer towards the beauty of God. He conveniently avoids telling us what parasites, diseases, predation, tsunamis etc etc tell us about God.   McGrath says that the question of God's existence is not a scientific question. 'It's more like the question of whether democracy is better than totalitarianism.' PRECISELY! Religions are the products of (almost exclusively) male minds. They are linked to self-interested tribal identity both to bond and identify 'us' and distinguish us from 'them'. And this is where Dawkins is lost on McGrath - Dawkins' writings undermine the very foundations for divisions and hierarchies not only of humans but of all life. Dawkins' frustration no doubt partly comes from the fact that evolved human tribalism is as ingrained as it so unfortunately is. McGrath himself knows and says that religious belief is about identity and status.  Finally, McGrath never touches on the most obvious point of religion - the promise of immortality. If this is not self-interested narcissism, a need to believe oneself so special that one cannot die and will reap great rewards in heaven, then I don't know what is. The dangers involved in this thinking are not addressed.  If McGrath truly believes we can all only be agnostic then he should be trying to persuade his fellow believers and not just atheists. If religious people worldwide adopted agnosticism it may dampen the flames of divisive, tribal religious fervor and increase general humility to everyone's benefit.  In the meantime I'm looking forward to reading Dawkins' 'The God Delusion'+books
Save your money+N+I thought this book would provide more insight on kitchen appliances and ways to downsize but cook different meals. The recipes were awful in my opinion and I would not want to eat them even at home, much less on the open road. A few good hints but not at the price of buying the book brand new+books
Ms Nettleton seems sincerely deluded ... :-0+N+This book is hilarious, evidently written toungue-in-cheek.  It is also at least to some extent fictitious, regarding her personal experiences, so perhaps it is best read as such.  One example of this is that she states her fourth husband "Bill" 'has no children of his own'.  This is untrue.  He has three children he adopted and then chose to walk out on.  Perhaps Ms. Nettleton was unaware of this fact at the time her book went to print.  That would, however, not really speak well to her doing due diligence on her suitors before marrying them+books
So repetetive in print that it will drive your child to boredom+N+I wanted to like this one.  I really did.  My son loves hand clap games and board books so it seemed like a natural fit.  He just seemed to hate the repetition in this one.  The sounds/words/rhythm are the same page in and page out and by page 5, he was acting like he does when I try to read a book to him a second time to avoid getting up to get another.  (He's seen it before and he knows it.+books
Sham not shaman+N+After reading the book Medicine Woman and the San Francisco Review of Books on the back which says this is an Autobiographical I have to question a few things.     I come from Manitoba and have lived there over 50 years.  I've never heard of a Crowley and the Cree First Nations in Manitoba that I was raised with would not be seeing a Kokopelli or a Kachina.  It's not part of their culture.  The last and final huge mistake is the fact that most of this story could not have taken place outside without huge huge bottles of mosquitoe repellant as anyone who lives in the bush in Manitoba knows especially those who may have a reason to go naked in the woods.  Perhaps Lynn shouldn't be peddling her strange brand of spiritualism as true when it's not.  There are enough charlatans in the world without one stealing someone's culture and calling it her own for the sake of the almight dollar.    Carol+books
Conrad's Greatest Novel+P+Nostromo is simultaneously a great political novel and a great psychological novel.  A large part of Conrad's achievement is his fusion of these 2 elements into one seamless narrative.  Nostromo describes the penetration of a Latin American country by European/North American capitalism and the ensuing revolution.  All the characters in Nostromo are engaged in the intensely political acts carrying the plot forward.  Conrad based his narrative on a considerable amount of research on contemporary Latin America and the articulation of the plot elements is elegantly realistic and gripping.  The psychological elements concern characters' motivations for their acts.  A recurrent ironic theme is that important characters are driven to act by motivations that have nothing to do with political objectives or economic gain per se.  Unlike most of his other novels which offer a psychological portrait primarily of a single character, Nostromo features several characters whose motivations and actions are explored by Conrad.  The focus shifts from character to character is a way that consistently advances the plot, a brilliant piece of formal construction.  Finally, Nostromo features some of Conrad's best descriptive writing.  Because of the complexity of the plot and characterization, Nostromo is not the easiest of Conrad's novels to read.  Nostromo is ultimately well worth the effort expended+books
excellent resource and teaching tool+P+as a health and wellness instructor with the government, i am constantly  asked to provide nutritional information and cooking tips for healthy  eating. the wellness encyclopedia is one of the best tools i have. with  it's clear, concise,writing and colorful pictures i highly recommend it's  use in both schools and at home+books
The Best of Marquez +P+One of my favorite books. I read this again a couple of months ago. Florentino Ariza's 50 year unrequited love for the haughty Fermina Daza is an amazing allegory of human love. When Fermina marries another man, Florentino doesn't ever give up. Doggedly he spends his life planning for their eventual getting together. In a way he is a ridiculous Don Quixote, undaunted by reality, pining over a lost cause. Somehow this bizarre little man hopes on. No, he doesn't hope. He insists. He becomes president of the local shipping company, he redecorates his childhood home with his love in mind, his love of the arts mirrors his love for her. Why does this work? Marquez is just a genius. He simply lets the characters tell their story and he writes down their words. And so they come to life+books
Beautifully written, even if it makes you squirm in places+P+How can a book contain so many disturbing, even highly distasteful elements, yet remain so intoxicating and intriguing? Such things from a lesser writer and I would have thrown the book across the room. But with this one I could not. I was compelled. Marquez is part poet, part magician. It is the only explanation I can find.  And in spite of itself, this story leaves you with a feeling almost akin to reverence. Reverence for romantic love even in very old age.+books
Levenda's Leftist Lexicon+N+This is now the third of Levenda's books I have read and the second in this particular series.  As other reviewers have noted, by the end of this edition, the author's leftist political views and anti-Catholic epistemological perspective overwhelm the narrative to the point that credibility suffers.  This is really rather sad, as Levenda is a talented writer, who has done, evidently, some significant research.  Unfortunately, it becomes hard to take an author seriously who quite rightly attacks the Bush clan, whilst holding the hideous Clintons above reproach, and worse, misses no opportunity to villify the Church, while smiling at Wicca.  The hypocricy is really breathtaking.  Understand that, in the corpus of this text, there is much that is worthwhile, certainly entertaining, and well presented.  It is simply that the dictates of scrupulosity and exactitude cry out for better balance.  This volume ends, as did the last, not with a bang, but with a whimper.  In fact, Levenda's last paragraph is, in its entirety, a quote from "The Book of Ceremonial Magic", of all things.  We are left wondering as to the efficacy of picking up the next volume in the series.  There is much else that cries out to be read.  We may read the next in volume, if only in the hope that some sense of balance can be restored.  But this may be another example of the triumph of hope over experience.+books
Could be worse, but could be more thought-provoking+P+I agree that the included articles could be better. They are dry &amp; I find that they don't encourage a lot of discussion without prompting. They seem like &quot;safe&quot; choices designed not for thought but sheer modelling. What I DO really like is the prewriting activities included at the end of each chapter. My students always appreciate all of the writing they have done by the time the draft is due, though I have added to the exercises to make the more in-depth and individualized. Not the ideal Comp 1 book, but certainly not the worst I've used+books
Want SK's scariest short story ever? Look no further...+P+In this collection of 14 short stories by everyone's favorite boogeyman Stephen King, there is a one particular story in here called "1408" that is in my honest opinion, the scariest short story that King has published to date. It deals with a haunted hotel room and I'm not telling you anymore than that. What I will say is that I've read this one story at least ten times and it never fails to make the hairs on my neck stand straight up.   If you, dear Amazon shopper, like the feeling of being terrified this is what I suggest:  Get your hands on a copy of this book.  When you've done that, make sure you save "1408" for a night that you're alone. Try to read this one when you're nice and relaxed and really try to let yourself get immersed in King's masterful storytelling. I guarantee that at least nine out of ten of you that follow my suggestions will get spooked something awful.  As for the rest of the book, it really is a return to form for King as far as his short story collections go ("Nightmares and Dreamscapes", the book and not the TNT series, wasn't all that great save for a couple). Most of the stories here are hits rather than misses and "1408" isn't the only story here that will give you the chills. "The Man in the Black Suit" is pretty intense (not to mention King won an O. Henry Award for that one). "Riding the Bullet", the famed e-book from a few years back is here also, as well as a nice little side tale from the Dark Tower series titled "The Little Sisters of Eleuria".  I recommend this book to the fans and the non-fans alike as this is a great collection. Plus, "1408" is calling+books
Whole language a failure - whole math is no better+N+The concept of whole language when implemented in California in the 80s was a total debacle and I see that there are still books out there promoting the &quot;whole&quot; concept, only this time it is in math.  Use this book only in addition to tried and proven ways of teaching math+books
Terrible+N+This is one of the worst textbooks i have ever used. The book uses lame metaphors. The style of writing is also horrible. It is very hard to understand and has a lot of "fluff" information. I do not suggest any AP US history students to read this for the AP exam+books
Mad Man Across the Water+P+High seas adventure with one of the most psychopath captains to command a ship.  While it is a well known fact that many captains, especially those of whaling ships, were rigid, callous and at times barbaric in their conduct, Howes Norris was in the upper echelon of this deranged behavioral class. Whether it was horrific floggings, withholding food, or senseless other malicious acts of torment, some may say that Norris got what was coming to him.  Joan Druett attempts to unfold the mystery of Norris' murder through two journals that were shrouded in secrecy for over 150 years.  It is a good, entertaining read. For this reader though, the evidence is still inconclusive as to who was really responsible for Norris' death.  All indications are that the two slain natives were held accountable but who was really the instigator? +books
Sadist On The High Seas+P+Joan Druett adds her name to the growing list of authors who have, in the last few years, tackled the topic of seafaring misadventure. We have had several excellent entries in this genre, including Nathaniel Philbrick's "In The Heart Of The Sea" and Mike Dash's "Batavia's Graveyard." Joan Druett's book is not quite on the level of those two books- they are "richer" in their narrative drive and complexity- but "In The Wake Of Madness" is still a good, solid "read." The author points out that at the time of the mutiny on the whaleship "Sharon," people who were not on board the ship assumed that the South Sea Islanders who killed Captain Howes Norris did so because they were "cannibals" and "heathens." The people who had direct knowledge of the events preceding the mutiny did nothing to dispel this notion- to do so would have raised questions concerning their own active or passive complicity in Norris's actions and could have damaged the careers of some highly ambitious ships' officers. It turns out that Captain Norris had, over a long period of time, systematically beaten and abused an 18 year old crew member (and apparent fugitive slave) named George Babcock. A combination of floggings and backbreaking labor finally resulted in the death of Babcock. Worse still, it appears that Norris knew, way before the final denouement, that his actions would result in Babcock's death. It was the result he was looking for. Druett speculates on the motivation(s): racism, anger/fear (Norris had had trouble keeping control over his crew on a prior voyage on a different ship), frustration (the "Sharon" was having very bad luck finding and catching whales), etc. Of course, harsh discipline was nothing unusual on board ships at the time. But Norris seems to have been especially brutal, even by 19th century standards. Babcock at one point tried to get help from his fellow crewmembers, as he feared for his life. His mates did try to protect him, before finally yielding to the authority of the captain and his officers. Why did the officers support the captain? We have to remember that a captain was sovereign of his ship. Going against his wishes could result in being branded a mutineer...not exactly good for your career. In any event, it appears that the South Sea Islanders who killed Captain Norris were either similarly abused or felt that, given enough time, they would suffer the same fate as Babcock. "In The Wake Of Madness" works as both an adventure story- as Mrs. Druett describes the recapture of the "Sharon" by her crew- and as something broader- as we learn a bit about the day-to-day operation of a whaling ship and of the cultural dynamics that came into play when New England whalers met Pacific Islanders. Stopping off at the islands was a bit like playing "Russian Roulette." On some islands, the natives were very friendly and would provide women and food for trade goods (although they did have a propensity for stealing anything made of iron that wasn't nailed down). On other islands you could run into cannibals or natives who would murder the crew and steal the ship. Not infrequently, some crewmembers who felt misused would jump-ship at some friendly port-of-call and "go native" or try to "sign-on" with another whaling ship with a more easy-going captain. We also learn a little about life back home on Martha's Vineyard. The book seems a bit abrupt and frantically paced, with Mrs. Druett attempting to juggle all this in only 230 pages. Still, this is a generally well-written, interesting book, and worth your time+books
SUSPENCEFULL AND TOUCHING+P+I am currently about 2/3rds through this book.  I am enjoying the book very much, but I just noticed  that the very last pages including the last page of the book was ripped in half.  I don't want to  have to send the  book back to Amazon, but would be greatful if someone has the book, would  make a copy of the last 2 pages and fax to me at 404/648-8500 attn:  Vicky.........Thanks!  This is really a great book and I plan on ordering  the 3 sequels+books
Excellent, easy recipes+P+This book provides a nice mix of tofu and non-tofu dishes that are easy to make with very few ingredients.  The other plus of the book is that easy doesn't mean just combining two canned foods to make a meal, but rather emphasizes fresh (usually healthy) ingredients.  +books

One Amazing Adventure for a Thief+P+The story starts with an introduction to a somewhat cantankerous, yet highly amusing character, Gen. He is stuck in jail, having been caught thieving. He bragged about the theft, which is what got him caught.   He is taken from prison and told that the King wishes for him to steal something for him that many believe to only be a myth. Gen's only other option is death. So onward the journey goes. He travels with the Magus and his two apprentices, Ambiades and Sophos, plus the admirable soldier, Pol.  Gen is treated as a subservient fool and most times is thought of as nothing but a tool to enact the theft. This viewpoint lends a somewhat snide, yet funny and endearing perspective of the story. I enjoyed watching as the character dynamics changed throughout.  Plus, on their journey we are introduced to the legends of their Gods through campfire stories, which I found a wonderful addition to the story. They added flavor to the history of the lands and gave us an understanding of how the people thought and why they did what they did.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading this tale. Yes, a worthy read indeed+books
unbelievably lame+N+Why did I buy this? I guess it seemed like an interesting idea from looking through it at a bookstore. When I checked on line, it sounded interesting. Boy, was I wrong. I think I finished it. Pointless. I didn't care for any of the characters+books
Endless tape that repeats itself+N+There is no significance in this book. Most of the people already know that there are sweatshops out there. It can be in the US soils or not. They make a product or support the operations. Many companies use these practices to make money quick. Also I can imagine most of the people understand that it is difficult to be a customer service representative. I really didn't need to be told these ten thousand times. This book didn't make me laugh it made me depressed. No wonder this book is so repetitive since there is not much for author to write on the subject that it is repetitive to start wit+books
dated and best-forgotten+N+The low-point in the great man's career, the book shows little feel for rock and roll and its hippy messiah of a protagonist is almost as embarrassing as Jim Morrison himself was. The lyrics are especially awful and the whole thing seems dated - like most genuine late 60s / early 70s  rock. De Lillo went on to much, much greater things, which is what you  should read instead+books
Wonderful+P+I had to read a biography so I picked an amazing artist, George Harrison Behind Sad eyes teels his life from his small years to his sad death a must read for any Beatles fan   ~Tinkerbell Queen BoNeZi+books
An effort not reaching a good result+N+The book is written with the purpose to be an "up-to-date [source about] DC/DC converters for students and practicing professionals". It is a shame how this target is not reached. Since from the very begin, the introduction, you will face an answer: what is its usefulness? You'll hope that, going on reading, everything will be clearer, and, from a certain point of view, this is what you get: what you've seen in introduction is eventually explained so that it could be useful even to students. However the text neither is "practical" nor gives you the "in-depth-analysis" you were hoping since its title begins with "Advanced". Schematics are rarely useful to understand the following analysis and are often badly sketched/printed. Mathematical derivations are quite good but not enough to fulfill designers needs. Apart from this it is a good effort. In my opinion readers should have to wait the next edition, if there will be a next edition+books
Ida B Info+P+Ida B is an excellent book. It's about a girl who lives on a farm. She talks to and names the apple trees. She is homeschooled until her mother gets cancer. Then, she is forced to go to a public school. The family has to sell some of their land to pay for Mama's treatments. Ida B has a difficult time coping with this, but thanks to her teacher she turned back to the same Ida B.+books
The "Waiting for Godot" of Novels+N+The Moviegoer is a book about a 30 year, disaffected businessman.  He's successful and liked, from a rich New Orleans family, but bored with life. He doesn't know what he wants, and doesn't know what to do about it.  This description, however, sounds like Binx Bolling, the main character, is actually doing something to figure out what's wrong.  Unfortunately, the book just follows him around through his life over the course of a week and describes his boredom and dissatisfaction with the things around him.  While interesting from a theoretical, philosophical, existential point of view, it makes for boring reading.  In addition, the book, released in 1960 feels badly dated, about a time and place that no longer exists, so while I have experienced my own bouts of existential angst, Binx's problems are not mine and the book is not written in a way to help sympathize with his plight. This is in stark contrast to Kafka, for example, whose stories of frustration and nothingness from 19th century Prague can bring me to tears.    While the novel is set in New Orleans, there is little description to make the unique setting visible other than the names of a few streets. Similarly, Binx remains a faceless everyman, and the women he dates so interchangeable that Binx himself can barely keep them distinct.  The title, too, is misleading.  "The Moviegoer" made me expect a story about a person who lived his life through characters in the movies.  While Binx does attend movies regularly and describes people in terms of long forgotten actors, I have to assume the title refers to Binx's problem of watching life around him without participating the same way as we watch a movie.    Like the existential play "Waiting for Godot" this story is mostly about the lack of a story, and though things happen, there is little sense of suspense or caring to carry the narrative forward.   If you're looking for an existential novel, I'd strongly recommend Kafka's The Castle or The Trial instead.  And if you're looking for an enjoyable novel that truly distills the distinctiveness of New Orleans with a truly memorable set of characters, A Confederacy of Dunces (John Kennedy Toole) (which Walker Percy was instrumental in having published after the suicide of the author) is among the best novels of our times.  But The Moviegoer is a hard slog for little payoff. +books
Great Source+P+Outstanding book for all Beatles lovers. Great and accurate scores. Lots of fun+books
I'm Trying To Think of Something Good To Say+N+I can't find anything good to say about this book.  I agree that it's tedious, boring and a waste of money.  I put it down and picked it up and then asked myself 'why', closed it up and put it up.  I was going to sell it here but everyone else who tried to read it beat me to it.  It's not even worth the $.01.+books
Delightful!+P+Karen O'Connor's new book is a gem.  I found myself laughing out loud, nodding and then relaying her quips and common sense with friends and family.  I've always enjoyed Ms. O'Connor's other books, but this is the best yet. It's also a book to share. Buy one for yourself and give 'em as presents &quot;just because.&quot;  That's what I'm going to do+books
Somewhat dull and unsatisfying +N+Somewhat dull and unsatisfying, like some other "literary" works I've read which don't hole my interest, don't resolve problems, swimming endlessly in the inner thoughts of a person with no action or only references to previous actions. I enjoyed his 'They Came Like Swallows' because it was very satisfying, but this is too "literary" for me in the sense that it appears to be more about the writer's writing ability than the actual story.+books
historical truth?+N+I'm interested by all the reviewers who claim this book is a good one despite the racist stereotypes of "savage" natives because, they say, it's "the truth."  The review before mine is especially interesting; he proclaims to love the book and reads it to his children as it teaches about defending your home against terrorism.  Reviewers like myself are just spewing "liberal diatribe."  Another reviewer asks "as for the savages, who was attacking who?"    Everyone thinks of the scenario of little Edward and his innocent family just living their lives until these terrible Indians come along and want to wipe them out.  In the interest of historical truth, would you look at it another way?  Think of your home and neighborhood.  You may have lived there for years, or you may have just moved from a neighboring town.  You participate in community activities, your children are educated with your neighbors children, you attend religious services.  Then one day, a group of foreign soldiers come into your neighborhood, and say it now belongs to them.  As Americans, how would you feel if a group of Italian, English, Russian, French, etc., soldiers did this?  They claim the neighborhood in the name of their government and demand that you leave your home and go elsewhere.    Pretend no telephones, telegraph, or internet exist.  You go to your government and tell them about the soldiers, but they have no way of notifying the foriegn soldiers government that this land is already settled.  Your government sends an army to eject the soldiers, but is defeated.  Eventually you have to leave.  The soldiers keep coming, and it's not long before families from the soldiers land come as well.  They keep expanding further and further, and forcing you and your family to keep moving, killing many of your family and friends.    Eventually all of you have had enough of this treatment - instead of fighting only their soldiers, your leaders get small citizen's armies together to attack their settlements as they have yours.  Now, who is the terrorist in this case?    If you want your children to know the historical truth, you should tell them the whole truth.  Comparing the original inhabitants of North and South America to the 9-11 terrorists is not accurate.  Comparing the european invaders - let me see, they killed the natives who wanted to keep the land they'd lived on for centuries, and forcibly converted them to european religions, as the native religions were "heathen."    If you believe everything I've written is just "liberal diatribe," go on happily reading this book to your kids, with no true historical references.  I'm just a mixed-blood savage, so of course what I think won't count with you. +books
Precious Little Addition to Espionage+N+Page after page and line after line, this book is amazing in its power to frustrate even the most gawky-eyed initiate in the world of espionage-reading! Philby says pretty much nothing that will add to our knowledge of his ways and mechanics of operation. He is a fine writer, without doubt, but good writing befreft of content? He does not wax expansive on his faith - communism; he does not explain the hows of his first contact with the KGB; he does not even offer a strand of information on his life in Moscow, his marriage, his routine... aww, come on ...     Pick it up and read it one three-hour layover at the airport... then place it in your library so that you have a book (for the record) that was written by THE spy who outdid 'em all!+books
Nothing new and bad photos+N+I agree with the above review; minimal information, absolutely horrible photos and rather crummy quality paper makes this book not worth buying.  Meadmore selected many chairs that are discussed much more completely in other similar books.  He missed a few key chairs of note; Saarinen's Grasshopper chair and Aalto's Armchair 400 (Zebra or tank) chair.  If you want a good welll rounded selection of Modern Chairs, I'd suggest the 1000 Chairs book instead+books
Great resource for plus size women that want style tips+P+This is a very complete book on all aspects of us plus sized women--clothing, style and fit, accessories, makeup, etc. I highly recommend it if you tend to need occasional assistance in fit and style+books
An excellent devotional for men.+P+As I struggle to renew my faith and walk with the Lord Jesus, I find this devotional Bible an excellent way to start and end the day.  It's comforting how each daily devotion seems to address deeply personal issues regarding my feelings and concerns regarding being a better husband, father, and, most importantly, a better Christian.  Highly recommended+books
Big Hit!+P+My son who is 6 yrs old received this for Christmas.  He is able to read quite well on his own but he really enjoys listening to the stories.  Sometimes he will read along with the book and this helps with word recognition and other times he'll listen to the CD at bedtime.  We plan on using them on a future car trip which will be something great to help pass the time+books

Terrific for toddler truck fanatics+P+My three year old son loves this book and anticipates the text+books
Not that good+P+I don't mean not very good, I mean not as good as people say it is. I really don't understand why people think Zahn is so brilliant.   Zahn is an excellent storyteller, but honestly, he isn't a very good writer. The trilogy is plagued by gratuitous references back to events in the movies. "Luke reaches for his lightsaber, and recalls when he was hung upside down in a wampa cave on Hoth and had to use the Force to get his lightsaber from the snow." It's not necessary, and I groaned every time Zahn did it. James Luceno knows how to make appropriate and timely references. Zahn fails.  I personally liked the specific technical jargon, but I'm surprised that most other people did, too.   The story, though, what can I say? It's a good story. Grand Admiral Thrawn is the most awesome person I know. It was genuinely hard to be happy seeing the empire defeated this time around. I hated C'Boath, but then again, you'te supposed to.  The noghri are a fascinating creation and their story is followed all the way through.   Everyone we know from the movies are there with a role, and act appropriately, although you never get the feeling that you've learned anything more about any existing character. New characters, like Mara Jade and Talon Kaarde, are superb additions to the saga. Creating characters really is Zahn's strongest point, I feel.   The books fall victim of being written before the prequels, and being early EU novels in general but that is no one's fault, and the "errors" are reconciled easily enough.  As a trilogy, it is consistent and drives towards a consistent goal throughout.   One other thing about the story, and I think this is why so many people adore these books more than I think they deserve, is that it is epic. I have yet to read another Star Wars book or series that approaches the expanse and import of this trilogy. It really concerns a huge part of the Star Wars timeline, and as a story matches the significance of the movies themselves, unlike any other books. That doesn't make these books the best books, most interesting, or best written, but I think it is that epic feeling that makes this series so popular, despite being unspectacular in several ways.+books
Can't argue with results+P+You can argue all you want about qualifications of Mr. Cherniske.  But I will say that my daily caffiene intake was from 600-1100mg a day for years, I quit cold turkey about a month before I started reading the book...and the withdrawal was incredible....headaches, shakes, irritable beyond belief.  You can't say this isn't an additive drug while you're slugging down four or more startbucks coffees a day.    For months and months I've had hard a time sleeping, waking up in the morning feeling like I have no energy at all.  Within two weeks of quitting caffien, I feel great.  I still go to bed at 11:30-midnight and get up the same time at 5:45am, yet in the morning I can now get up without any problems and I'm awake the whole day without fatigue, feeling more energized.  I CHANGED NOTHING ELSE IN MY DIET OR ROUTINE.  I still eat the same stuff as before and have not started exorcizing, or most of all...have taken NONE of the suggested suppliments in the book.  The only thing I did was stop drinking coffee/coke and started drinking more water.  So save yourself a few bucks if you don't want to buy the book, but do yourself a favor and cut out caffiene.  The withdrawal sucks, but it doesn't last for ever.  If anything once you get through it, it will give you reason to stay away from caffeine.  Da+books
From a teacher's perspective+P+While I agree that this is not a text that delves deep into the theories of Lacan or Derrida or Fish or any of the others, it is not intended to do so.  I have found it to be an excellent tool for introducing my high school Advanced Placement students to the world of literary criticism.  Certainly some of the articles can get wordy or bogged down in "technical" detail, but literary criticism has never been for the reader who wants to skim and get the assignment "over with."  Any critical theory takes time and patience to work through; critical theory questions ideas and requires a commitment on the part of the reader to think, question, and engage with the text.  There are some essays that younger students simply do not have the skills for yet but there are others that are quite accessible to them.  In particular, my students found the essays on Representation, Structure, Race, and Canon very interesting.  This source has one significant advantage over many other texts.  For each article, there is an immediate application of the technique to a well-known piece of literature.  I know that my students reading of Appiah's essay on race dramatically impacted how they interpreted Shakespeare's play Othello and then later Schuyler's novel Black No More.  While neither my students nor I always agree with what the critics are saying, I have found the book a great starting point for discussion+books
Great for the Cartoonist+P+This is a well done cartooning book. As an amatuer with only a hint of talent at drawing, I gained a great deal fromt this book. It helps you to see the simple shapes that most cartoons start from and how to build upon it. It is more geared toward the teen audience, but adults and even young children could gain much from it. The directions are simple to follow and there are tons of examples and illustrations. Even a non-artist like me was able to turn out some impressive cartoons. This would be a great book for anyone interested in drawing and/or cartooning+books
Pretty Neat Book+P+As the synopsis indicates, this book is about a cat that dies 8 times before it finds it's life-to-be whle he is living the ninth.  There's a little angel-like picture of the cat with angel wings leaving each time the cat dies.  It's interesting but oftentimes, I think a little much for the toddlers.  There's a bunch of info in this book that makes it fun to discover and explore and actually, I think the artwork is better than the actual story.  The idea behind this is good, but I think I agree with the other reviewers that more and equal focus should be placed on the story itself, and not just in the illustrations.  My favorite part is seeing what's going on behind the scenes in the illustrations alongside the pages.    It's a nice book but maybe look for another one of Brett's books if you're reading this to a toddler. It's not as entertaining as say her Gingerbread Baby book+books
Does NOT live up to it's title.+N+The contents of this activity book do not live up to the title.  Many are not "on the go" activities, let alone easy for little kids to follow without supervision.  As a teacher, this proved to be a poor investment of my time and money.  You would be best to not make the same mistake+books
Disappointment+N+Highly disappointing. No substance. It was a book filled with references to other books. Wish I had bought one of those instead!!!+books
Don't be discouraged -- keep reading+P+I found that the first 2-3 volumes of this Dark Horse reprint weren't as good as the First Comics translations from several years ago, but don't be discouraged. The quality picks up in volume three, and enough cannot be said about this series. It is one of the finest comic series ever written: a violent, visceral, absorbing story that deserves to be read rather than read about+books
The Presidential Difference+P+This book offers insightful, thorough, and well-reasoned analysis of every  modern president, from FDR through Clinton, all in slightly more than 100  pages.  Greenstein concisely but comprehensively reviews all of these  presidents based on various categories -- from charisma to cognitive  abilities to emotional maturity.  Beyond that, he provides a historical  backdrop to each presidency, providing context and texture for each tenure.   This book offered fresh perspectives to most every presidency, and forced  me to reevaluate the Bush and Ford presidencies in particular.  I imagine  most readers will find that Greenstein's book challenges many of their  long-held assumptions too+books
Looking for prolife information will not find it here.+N+I had to use this particular book for a class I was taking.    I was hoping for at least a balanced presentation, but I was very disappointed with this book.  I found it to have a definite anti-life view.  I found that the author minimized the role of morality in the field of bioethics.  Especially how religion contributes to moral views and how that effects bioethics.    I also found that the author tried to present Catholic Church teachings specifically without even a basic understanding of how the Church developed these views+books
An excellent classic+P+This book is a beautiful story in so many ways - the strong, complex characters, and the history of a legendary part of the United States being just two of them. The world through the main character's eyes is a world seen anew. The reader truly can feel raw intensity of early 20th century Brooklyn, the challenge and joy of immigrant communities living together. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for an enriching and enchanting story.  +books
Not just for secondhand shoppers!+P+I think this is the only book of its kind on the market now, so I would recommend it if only for this reason to women who like to dress well at low cost.  However, it's better than I expected, thanks to an author who gives very detailed information about what makes a garment well constructed, down to the buttons. This book is useful for anybody shopping for clothes anywhere, new or not. It's probably even a great gift for someone who sews their own clothes, that's how detailed it gets about garment construction. This book's main audience are women who want to get bargains on designer clothes (it even gives helpful lists of designer names and their &quot;poor cousin&quot; lines), and therefore are more likely to shop consignment rather than thrift. It's still helpful to vintage/thrift shoppers too (especially section on stain removal) but I wish she had included more tips for those shoppers, as well as more info on shoes.  I think a sequel is in order because I think the author probably has a lot more to say. If so, please include a chapter on shopping for clothes online. This book has nothing on this topic, which is an art in itself! I'd also like to recommend Al Hoff's Thrift Score+books
Unbelievable cast of characters+N+Short version: A half dozen scientists and engineers are working in the arctic, attempting to use explosives to create a huge iceberg that can floated to someplace in dire need of fresh water. They become marooned and only have a few hours before the explosives they've planted go off and kill them. However, a Russian sub may be able to save them.  Koontz had the right idea when he originally released this book under a pseudonym, because it's a stinker.  The set-up building to the scientists being stranded and the deadline imposed by the explosives is unbelievable. Suffice it to say that a natural disaster hundreds of miles away just happens to target the exact location of where the scientists are working. Additionally, they've planted explosives in the ice that are on timers and can't be switched off.  Besides suffering from incompetence, the characters have unbelievably bad luck (beyond being targeted for destruction by Mother Nature, that is):   -One is highly phobic, terrified of (you guessed it): ice & snow (because of an accident that killed her parents)! -Another's family was murdered in China -Another's had close relatives assasinated while in office and is disillusioned by politics (a thinly disguised JFK jr?) -Another lost his son to cancer -Another's psychotic  If that's not bad enough, the main characters are a husband and wife team who run the project. She had a relationship with another scientist that ended badly before getting married to the current guy. So who does her husband pick to spend months on ice with? Why the ex-boyfriend of course! Because he was the best at what he did (excuse me, wouldn't second best have made more sense?)  If you don't mind really bad dialog and trite situations, give this book a try. If you want a really intense adventure/thriller try Wilbur Smith's "Hungry as the Sea" or anything by Nelson DeMille+books
"Some  people  are  still  water" . . .  being a survivor can be Agony . . .+P+Alison McGhee's story is about 17 year-old Rose surviving a collision in which she and her older sister, Ivy, were innocent  victims. Rose agonizes throughout Ivy's lengthy hospitalization, and the accident is replayed over & over; also the mother's 'coping mechanisms' - keeping her hands busy while her mind and heart cannot allow the release of Ivy from the hospital's life lines.  This is a  heart-wrenching story, like a movie that must be seen again and again  -  my reading became skimming at times: I identified Rose as a middle-schooler & didn't want her story to tell young girls that sex is a good release from the agony of being alive; nor is it safe, or without other consequences. (I was never comfortable about the time our daughters spent on the school bus!) McGhee's characters became a part of my life, not to  be sloughed off easily.  (Don't miss her other teen novel, "SNAP" - - also excellent reading for adults.)  Reviewer mcHAIKU agrees with the judges for Minnesota's 2006 Book Awards that the author's "poetic text authentically and movingly reflects the thoughts and actions of a teen who is desperately trying to salvage her life." Alison McGhee's writing, and the characters that developed strengths, the quotes which melded to become prime movers for the telling , and the friends who cultivated the writer's talents - - all are to be admired.   (p.s.: I do wonder why Alison McGhee left the Adirondacks for Minnesota?!)  +books
Beautiful Translation of a Great Book!+P+The only translation that you can proudly give as a gift. It is just beautiful!

It includes a glossary at the back that explains the Chinese ideograms in more detail+books

The Great War in Retrospect+P+There are many reasons why World War I has been labeled THE GREAT WAR: it was the war to end all wars in the minds of those who lived through it, who were directly and indirectly affected by it, who continue to reference it as the war with the most emotional cost.  In times when wars seems to constantly queue since that inception of world war, wars spreading  from WW II, through Korea, Vietnam, the Gulf, Balkans, Eastern Europe, Spain, Africa, Iraq, Afghanistan, South America and on, taking a long hard look at the Great War will hopefully center our attention on a past time that can be analyzed and from which we can hopefully learn.  Now that Jay Winters' brilliant book 'Sites of Memory, Sites of Mourning : The Great War in European Cultural History' is available/affordable in paperback, every household should have a copy as children grow into the years of this century.  Winters' examination of the devastation of WW I and the ways in which it informed all of the arts, the architecture, the literature, films, memorials - the people of the globe - is a mighty assignment  and he is more than successful in humanizing his message.  This book overflows with photographs of places, faces, bodies alive and dead, paintings, sculptures, film stills - each of which drives home Winters' powerful message.  Sad though it may be to admit, war is a part of life on this abused planet: the more we study it the more we hopefully will reduce it.  Winters wants to make sure that we remember, that we read, view, walk through, see, hear, and listen to the remnants the Great War left behind.  This is a powerful, necessary book and should be required reading and viewing for us all.  Highly recommended.  Grady Harp, August 0+books
Excellent Book for Beginners and Experts+P+Once again, Tom Rosenbauer delivers a clearly-written, practical, and insightful book on fly-fishing. This time he looks at tying and gives many practical tips--especially on the use of tools and materials. For example, a beginner is hit with all these tools--which ones are best, which ones to use, etc. Rosenbauer gives clear descriptions of which tools are most useful, what they're used for, and which ones you don't really need. At the same time, he gives tips from his experience--also useful for the expert.  The bulk of the book is, of course, the fly-tying receipes. He provides many photographs of each step in making a fly. The many photos are probably more than the expert will need, but very important for a beginner. For the expert, you get many great fly receipes.  Overall, highly recommended fly-tying guide+books

You can always give this book as a gift to someone you know suffering from Blood Pressure.  It has everything in it.  Various treatment options, medicines and its  side effects, exercises needed, diets, supplements and a whole lot that will help the reader to have a normal and healthy life.

THE Book on Christian Ethics+P+This book is, I am convinced the best overall introduction to Christian ethics and the thought of Stanley Hauerwas.  Hauerwas has certainly written many wonderful books, but this one stands out in that it encapsulates a fairly coherent and articulate manner, his conception of what Christian ethics is and how they are lived out in the life of the church.  Hauerwas first offers a critique of ethics that would have pretentions to a universal status.  The way he states this is that all ethics require a qualifier ('Christian', 'Jewish', 'Hindu', etc.).  Every concievable ethic is grounded in a tradition and a narrative that gives substance to the ethical claims.  Thus, even though Christians believe that Christianity is true and Christian ethics are the right way for all people to live, this reality cannot be known without becoming a Christian, thereby making the stories of Israel and Jesus your story.  Thus, Christian ethics are not universal in the sense that they can be percieved as correct by anybody.  Rather to understand Christian ethics as true, one must be transformed through participation in Christ through the church.  This, of course grounds Hauerwas's claim that the church as a concrete community is the locus of Christian ethical reflection.  Obviously, the major theme of this book is nonviolence.  Hauerwas grounds this approach solidly on the narrative of the cross and resurrection of Christ which he holds to be decisive for the content of Christian claims about the world and life in it.  Over-against those who advocate an ethic of justifiable violence, Hauerwas contends that Christian ethics must be informed by the Biblical narrative of Christ, who won God's victory precisly through rejecting violence and inaugurating God's kingdom of justice and peace which the church is called to embody.  Hauerwas's ethic, contra Ramsey, Gustafson, Niebhur, Neuhaus, Stackhouse, Novak and others argues that Christ's teaching, life, death and resurrection should be decisive for our ethics, rather than dismissed as irrelevant.  In much of this Hauerwas draws on the excellent work of John Howard Yoder in "The Politics of Jesus" and "The Original Revolution."  This is a vitally important book, even for those who disagree with Hauerwas's Christ-centered, ecclesial ethic.  He very clearly shows in this book how his ethic takes into account the importance of deicisions and cooperating with non-Christians in the interest of social justice, issues that his critics often ignore in their overblown critques of his work.  This is a vital book for Christian theologians, ethicists and the all Christians who desire to take the gospel seriously.  Highly recommended+books
A Resource Every Kindergarten Teacher Should Have+P+I love how this book offers concrete and authentic ways to manage learning in Kindergarten.  The examples of the assessments used during writing conferences and reading groups are clear and managable.  It was easy for me to take her examples and utilize them in my own classroom to monitor and boost student achievement. Above all, the author's genuine love for children and belief that all children can have success shines through.  You can see your own classroom being as fun and inviting as the author describes.  Every Kindergarten teacher should read this book+books
Both sides of the coin...+N+Wow.  I read this book a few days ago, and definitely have my own opinion on it.  I thought I would come here and see what other folks are saying, and I'm not altogether surprised.  The first thing that continually surprises me when I read a poorly written book is how so many people can think it is, in fact, well-written, if not even brilliant.  There is, of course, no accounting for taste.    What disturbs me more than the inability of people to recognize both poor writing and equally poor scholarship (which suggests a lack in either education or practice) is how people can urge others to have a balanced view on a subject when they quite obviously could not be more imbalanced in their own views.  I urge those of you that see Bush as a righteous man to please "read around."  There are, obviously, dozens of books about this man and his actions that touch on topics that books like God and George W. Bush will not even acknowlege, much less discuss, defend, or justify.  To ignore these other sources of information is to be possibly tragically misinformed.  While I do not doubt that many of the previous reviews come from good and intelligent people, I am forced to wonder how they can support a man who performs acts, or at least allows them to be performed, that are every bit as vile as that which he claims to oppose.  Read other books and you will see.   One subject that always makes me wince is the labeling of those fighting our soldiers as evil.  I am not supporting them or denouncing our own, but merely urging all of us to recognize the humanity of others.  Labeling a people as evil undermines their humanity and suggests that they do not have good reasons to be fighting, but that they fight simply to overcome those who "love freedom."  This is from  page 114 of this very book, (a quote from Phyllis Wheatley) "In every human breast, God has implanted a principle which we call love of freedom."  Here's a 'revolutionary' thought: Everybody loves and wants freedom.  If people are fighting they are fighting for freedom, we simply must ask one question: Freedom from what?  Read around and see for yourself if you can answer such a question.  Also, see if you can discover, honestly and objectively, the freedoms that we are currently fighting for.  Another huge bother for me in this book is that Kengor refers to Texas as the largest state in the nation.  It's difficult to take the rest of his scholarship seriously when he makes such a statement.  Another horrific, to my mind, thought is that Bush, and lots of his followers, truly believes that God wants him to be president.  A megalomaniacal zealot in charge of a cadre of nukes with an "I'm on a mission from God" world view scares the hell out of me.+books

modern, yes; but very few homes available as prefabs+N+I was disappointed with this book.  It includes profiles of 15 architectural firms.  Seven of those profiles were of firms that have done one-off architect-designed homes made largely of pre-existing materials (usually shipping containers).  That is not my definition of a prefab house.  To me, a prefab house is one that I can order to be built on my lot.  Of the eight firms that offer prefab houses, for three of them only computer-generated images were presented (not photos of real houses).  That leaves only five firms offering prefab houses ready for market.  Of those, one builds 10 houses per year in Finland.  Another is in Australia.  Two offer only really small homes (generally intended as second homes).  The book does include (small) design plans and many photos for most of the houses.  However, the fact that very few of those homes are available for me to purchase makes the book almost useless. [...+books
folksy but conducive of thought crystallization+P+I found this book unsatisfactorily casual and slap-happy for the work of putative been-there-done-that expert with such lengthy tenure in and around things ufological.  Yet, by reading this, I did manage to concretize a philosophical system that has been emerging for years as I read one UFO book after another--while also reading widely in other things paranormal, as well as a spate of less abstract fields, such as history, science, linguistics, anthropology, and such.  Let us posit that aliens (1) exist; (2) have the technology to visit remote star systems; and (3) took greatly enhanced interest in earth only when it developed weapons systems capable of either harming other civilizations (i.e., in combination with its rocket technology) or of destroying itself (which would constitute a crying shame from the viewpoint of fundamentally beneficent aliens who respect other sentient life forms).  Keyhoe leads me to believe--amid his conspiratorial musings and his subtle hints at what was meant by what was really meant by what Mr. X thought that Mr. Y intended--that they are watching us and executing a hands-off policy until such time that we pose a direct, immediate danger to ourselves (this will occur long before we pose a direct and immediate danger to exocivilizations), at which time--Starfleet-style "Prime Directives" od non-interference notwithstanding--they will take whatever steps are necessary to ensure the harmonious continuation of our culture. Whether that means utterly conquering and enslaving us, or surreptitiously seizing control over certain key organs of our governments (possibly to include forging certain elements of the whole-earth government whose existence Einstein endorsed as a logical and necessary eventuality), or just providing cultural "guidance counselors," who can really say.  It is indeed food for thought to ponder the likely--well, the possible--archetypal alien ethos and surmise what it might intend for us and why it should, or will, occur when the time requires it+books
Super Lame!+N+Like others who have reviewed this book, I was very disappointed. I was completely surprised when the story was resolved on page 200 and, it looked like I had 1/2 the book left to read!  I will try the next one in case things improve.  If not, I'm done with the series+books
Let him walk the plank - You go read something else+N+At the end of this diatribe, the author admits that they don't want him back cruising. And I don't blame them. He is just one of those passengers that you can't please no matter what. Is he fussy? Let facts be submitted to a candid world: Quote: "On the ultra luxury Radisson Diamond, the same waiters that served my partner and me were also serving a table of senior officers and VIPs. Their mineral water was poured from a bottle wrapped in a white napkin; our mineral water - the same brand (how did he know if theirs was wrapped?) -- was poured without the napkin." Holy cow! Mineral water without a napkin - How dare they! At the same sitting, the author complains of a fish head that has fish eyes staring out at him and, guess what, the fish smells fishy! That's an earthquake! More complaints: The food isn't any better than a three star hotel! (Ever stay at a three star hotel in France? The food is super.) More whines: The VIPs get special treatments and special parties (Shocking!), the music around the pool is too loud, too rap and hard rock, the free wine on board only costs the cruise line only $2, he cracked a tooth and the cruise line wouldn't pay his dental bill until he got a lawyer friend who obtained the money plus "a meager compensation." But the thing that bothered me the most was his inconsistency. He berates the industry for alleged mistreatment of their employees and yet he himself seems to cause those employees more trouble that 99% of the other passengers and he can't figure out why those employees, like the bartender on page 157, whom he nagged for several days, hate him so much. He berates the passengers and ships for causing pollution, yet he himself has taken (and presumably will try to take) multiple cruises. The massive improvements in waste management and sanitation and pollution control and fuel efficiency are dismissed as not enough. He nitpicks about occasional oil spills but fails to mention that according to the US Coast Guard 99% of the oil pollution of the seas comes from natural sources, mainly undersea vents. But what's this? The author's website which is billed as a "noncommercial site regularly updated with links to reports, investigations, and new developments regarding labor, ship safety, and security" is not functioning. The website isn't function just the way this book isn't functioning. The best treatment for the likes of him is to throw him overboard or make him walk the plank. If you want to know about cruising, instead of reading this piece of junk, get a hold of any book by John Maxtone-Graham. His "The Only Way to Cross" is a classic.+books
A Practical, Result Oriented Approach+P+When my wife left me, instead of telling me there was another guy, she was grasping at straws when she blurted out, "You never listen to me." She didn't have the guts to tell me there was someone else, so I thought this was something I could fix. Lost Art was one of many books I bought in an effort to "fix" myself and save my marriage.   Of the books I purchased about listening, this book was the only one worth what I paid for it. There are some really terrible books out there on this subject.   Part two of my story.....  My father was a man of few words......especially over the phone. When I read Lost Art, I finally understood the "dynamic" between him and I. Phone conversations which used to last a minute or two were now lasting thirty minutes. One conversation we had was about an hour long and at the end of it, he told me that he loved me (which is a big deal in my family).   A month later, my father went into intensive care. Three months after that he passed away. I'm so happy that we had those conversations because I don't feel like we left anything unsaid between us.   As for my marriage, it's over. However, my soon to be ex and I get along very well. I won't say that we are good friends because that would be a lie. But I do beleive we are getting along a lot better than we would have if I had never read this book. I don't believe she left me because of my lack of listening skills, but I do believe that we are getting along so well because of these new skills.+books
Bummer subject to be writing about!+N+No one alive today cares that NY had fires in 1741 (UNLIKE THE CHICAGO fIRE OF 1871). Why did author Lepore choose to bring up this terrible racial incident. Is she trying to create trouble? Be a traitor to her own race? Book is well researched I guess but the racial subject matter stinks and was unnecessary to bring up! Totally unnecessary!+books
Disappointment...+N+I enjoy reading food narratives and childhood accounts of growing up in foreign countries; however, this book is quite a disappointment after reading the summary above.  The writing isn't great, the descriptions certainly don't transport you to Tuscany, and despite the title, I wouldn't say there is an emphasis on food.  If you were related to Patrizia, you mind find it an interesting read, but I've found myself skimming through it, searching for compelling passages, of which there are few+books
Country Life as Rehab+P+After the brief period of time it took to read this tale, I'm not surprised it found its way into my hands. This is not only a story I "get," (couple flees city for a life in the country) it's full of a self-deprecating and sarcastic wit I welcome when reading memoirs.  Jim Mullen, a humor columnist best known for his "Hot Sheet" in Entertainment Weekly, portrays Manhattan life as addiction. Addiction, for example, to non-stop action, Broadway plays, gallery openings, ethnic restaurants and The New York Times. The symptoms include immunity to noise and smells, and they lead to chain-smoking and excessive spending at The Sharper Image. He's hooked. It's his wife, Sue, who takes the lead and buys a farm three hours northwest of the city in the Catskills, and drags him along for what turn out to be rehabilitative weekends. As the weekends grow from two days to five and then finally full time, he gives up smoking, takes up bicycling and then learns about everything from growing giant pumpkins to the inner workings of a septic system. One realizes he has come full circle when he describes a dewy spider web as the prettiest thing he's ever seen and recognizes a "flatlander" in the garden store. While observing this newer version of the village idiot, he rolls his eyes and wonders if that's how he was when he first entered (the fictional town of) Walleye.  The writing is original and funny, informal without being glib, irreverent without being vulgar. For anyone who enjoys well-written memoirs--particularly those of the city-mouse, country mouse variety--put this on your list. Also recommend: "Fifty Acres and a Poodle."  From the author of "I'm Living Your Dream Life," and "The Things I Wish I'd Said," McKenna Publishing Group.+books
I feel there is something missing+P+The book provides a basic description on the subject supported by real-life stories about indigo children and situations of parents of indigo children. I liked the descriptions written on dealing with indigo education and the integration with alternative therapies and activation of energies and meditation.  Lee Carroll needs to explain more on dealing with indigos, and how-to's. I am sure another book will soon come up that will be more in - depth on indigo issues, especilally for us, the indigo adults and it would be great to have more on not only family relationships between indigos and others, but other types of relationships as well. How to make life easier for those around indigos, and the other way around. +books
GREAT BOOK!!!!!+P+This books deals great with strangers. It also shows not to judge a person by the outside. The only thing it needs is to tell kids what to do if a stranger does capture them.+books
Oh Dear....+N+This book doesn`t compare very well with any other recipe books you will have seen - there are no pictures of the finished dishes for a start. A lot of the "celebrities" you won`t have heard of - that shouldn`t matter if the recipes are good.  Its a very American book and doesn`t travel well; the quantities are measured in "cups", oven temps quoted in Fahrenheit only and products not available anywhere else (what are "graham crackers"??) There are lists at the back of bands with food names and songs with food names (brilliant journalism girls) and the authors thank you pages are hilarious - thanking their cats and themselves for the joy-filled experience of working with each other. I realise a recipe book has to have some simple ones included, but Hot Rod Hot Dogs - buy some hot dog sausages, buy some white buns, add some relish and mustard. Enjoy! Peanutbutter on Toast Sandwiches, buy some peanutbutter, toast some bread. Enjoy! They`re having a laugh, aren`t they? But this book is supporting a charity. It doesn`t actually say how much of the proceeds are going to Freedom From Hunger, just "some".....so I suggest you give your donation directly to the charity instead of buying thi+books
Am Israel Chai+P+This a compelling true story in which anyone who reads it will be swept up. It is about three men , Israel Carmi , Jochanan Pelz and Arie Pinchuk, who form the Jewish Brigade , a division of Jewish soldiers from Israel, in the British army-"the first official Jewish fighting force since the fall of the Judea to the Roman legions". At the time when Jews are being victimized and lead like sheep to the slaughter , the Jewish Brigade , with a yellow Star of David emblazoned to their uniform , fighting for the Jewish people , and their homeland of Israel, shows the world that Jews can fight back and win. It also tells the remarkable story of Arie Pichuk's sister Leah , and her escape from the Nazis , surviving as a fugitive in the Ukraine , before joining  the anti-Nazi Partisans. After the war , the men witness first hand what the Nazis have done to their people, and set off on a course of identifying , finding and killing Nazi officers who have participated in the holocaust. Their hatred and ferocity threatens to overwhelm them , until a chance encounter with an orphaned Jewish girl sets them on a more constructive course-smuggling Jewish boys and girls into Israel, despite the British blockade which tires to prevent Jews from entering the ancient homelnd from which they where forced out by the Romans two thousand years before. It is therefore a true narrative about the re-establishment of the State of Israel , where Jewish children can grow up insafety and live as free men and women , in a free homeland of their own. That is Zionism , which has been so maligned by evil forces , who want the Jews to fall pray to genocide again. Every descent person , Jew or Gentile , needs to dedicate themselves to ensuring that Israel survives as a Jewish State in which Jews can live freely and safely. Anything else will guarantee another holocaust. Israel and the Jewish people are faced with the same genocidal hate today , that the Jews where faced with during World War II Our heroes play a role in defending Israel after the fledgling state is attacked by five Arab armies , hellbent on genocide. Am Israel Chai.  The People of Israel live!  +books
Not for me+N+I came to this book wanting to believe, and leaning towards belief, but with plenty of skepticism. This book reinforced my skepticism. It is not intended as a defense of the visions, per se, but friendly non-skeptical interviews with the visionairies, and report of Marian messages to the Parish at Medjugorge, and a smattering of anecdotes of seemingly miraculous events. The interviews with the visionairies were most unsatisfying. The questions were leading and shallow, nothing like the kind of questions I wish I could ask. Even worse, the answers were stereotyped, vague, and even evasive. Was this a language barrier problem? An artifact of the interviews being condensed and edited? An effort to avoid arguments? Perhaps. But I kept comparing in my mind these transcripts with scriptural accounts of conversations with Jesus. Jesus, despite all language barriers and editing, was always very direct, clear, and substantive, and never shied away from stirring up controversy. Jesus also taught us to be on guard against the many false prophets who would surely come. I remain on guard+books
Why can't we give zero stars?+N+This book is a complete waste of paper and ink. As another reviewer stated already I don't get it. I got a little over half way through this book and hollered uncle. It made no sense and was headed nowhere+books
WTFO -  This does not deserve a review but...+N+I am a Panama (Just Cause) & Desert Shield/Storm vet, and after seeing the movie I read the book... well almost all of it.  This guy is a problem child PERIOD! Pissed off at the world, pissed off at life, and very lucky I didn't get my hands on him.  Snipers are crazy as another review stated, but this guy is that 5% of the Corps that that can give the other 95% a bad name.  Some of the boredom issues were true, wives/girlfriends dumping us was true, etc... but overall this guy just REALLY ticked me off... but THAT IS HIS GOAL IN LIFE ISN'T IT... Books about God, Country, Corps; things that are still thought, and observed by every Marine may just not shock the masses as much as a book aboutsome discontented, nonhacker, shiptbird.+books
repulsive+N+I read this book because after I read "Pure" by Rebecca Ray, I noticed this book was listed with "Pure" here on this site. I didn't really care for Rebecca Ray's book and I hope this one would be better. All this book did was made me realize that "Pure" really wasn't that horrible. If I could give this book zero stars, I would do it. It plays like an impossible fantasy put together by some stupid 20 year old who reads too many boring teen magazines still. In this book, It plays like a long letter some boring teenager is writing to her boyfriend. It never really feels like a letter though. That is such an contrived way for the author to tell her story. The teacher is never named either. The author describes sex scenes and the student mostly seduced the teacher. It sounds really dumb too. Like the author will go, "I switched sides I was laying on to look especially sexy for you" and if you like hearing that same sort of garbage over and over again, I guess this is the book for you. The author tries to sexualize a 14 year old and make it sound like her every movement or thought was about sleeping with her teacher. It was really disgusting that the author would write something like this and it was disturbing too. Normal kids don't think and act this way. It's clear that the author enjoys the fantasy of being just a teen with a adult lover but what she has done by writing this crap is try to make teen girls sound manipulative and over sexual. It's nasty. It's her twenty year old thoughts and words put into the body of a 14 year old for the story. Her story is not believeable anyway. The uncle and aunt never try to find their niece? The teacher never gets in trouble or found out for what he is doing? Not buying it. Also, the book has very many cringe worthy moments such as when she keeps berating the teacher, calling him stupid, encouraging him to sleep with her, yuck. And then it's "darling" this and "baby" everywhere else. It's sickening. After I read this, I threw it in a dumpster so noone else would have the misfortune of reading it. Not even fit to give away. horrible+books
Happy Birthday, Alphonse.....+P+Louis' Uncle McAllister lives in Scotland and every year sends Louis the best birthday present.  And this year was no different, a tadpole, Louis names Alphonse.  But it soon becomes apparent that Alphonse is not your normal, everyday tadpole and definitely not turning into a frog.  He soon outgrows his jar, then the kitchen sink, and bathtub.  Louis sneaks him into the school swimming pool during summer vacation, and that works out just fine until fall when school opens.  In a panic Louis consults Miss Seevers, the librarian.  Librarians always have all the answers, and Miss Seevers doesn't let him down.  With a phone call to Scotland, a little research, and a lot of ingenuity, Louis and Miss Severs find a clever solution and happily-ever-after ending to their problem.....  First published twenty-five years ago, Steven Kellogg's creative classic, The Mysterious Tadpole, is as fresh and entertaining today as it was back in 1977.  Mr Kellogg has given his new illustrations a bold and bright facelift, and tweaked the text a bit, but the engaging and fun-filled story with its hilarious twist at the end, is still sure to capture the imagination and warm your heart.  Perfect for youngsters 3-7, The Mysterious Tadpole is a timeless treasure to share with friends and family now, and future generations in the years to come+books
remember this is the "old" version...+N+Having not seen the orginal Rudolph TV show in a very long time I forgot what the story line was... remember that in this version of the story the snowman eats reindeers and apparently elves or anything else that would be upsetting to a child. There are a couple of scary illustrations in this book. My 3 year old was in love with the Rudolph movie but once he saw this book he refused to ever have anything to do with Rudolph again because he said he "didn't like the scary snowman".  Yes, I know it's a classic, but be warned+books
Massie....please,  FIND a new dead horse to beat!+N+Robert Massie has spent execptional amounts of time for over 30 years flaying this dead horse about the Romanvos. He has all ways been dead wrong with any of his "findings".  As any /every one knows, history is a fairy tale, slanted by the winning side. Russians are incapable of telling the truth. The British are not known as exceptionally truthful. There are legions of individuals both directly involved and peripherally involved with the "fate" of the Romanovs, but none will band together and state the facts. TOO, too ridiculous, with Massie acting like Moses coming down from the Mount. Hey, Bob, after all, it is ONLY your version of the facts.   His "research" is sloppy, he relies on dubious sources. He violates all the basic tenets of factual, honest journalism.   By all means, AVOID any and all books with Massie's name on them. Total waste of time, effort, ink, paper and money. He should have quit with "Nicholas & Alexandra", so long ago+books
Did not engage my 10-year-old+N+This was required reading for my son going into fifth grade.  He is not a strong reader, and neither he nor I enjoyed it.  The combination of a large amount of flowery language and very little action made it a struggle to get through.  What little humor there was, was too sophisticated.  It was hard for us to identify with this foppish married mouse who ate caviar and champagne.  While I can appreciate that many (I guess most!) find it literary and delicious, my son found it boring, and looking at it through his eyes, I have to agree+books
Poor execution of a good idea+N+The idea was to have the essentials of AC/DC circuit analysis, linear circuits, electronic circuits, digital logic circuit design, electromechanical machines, and control theory in one handy outline. The problem is, any one of these subjects is way too complex and deep as it is presented in most universities for the book to be helpful for undergraduate electrical engineering students. Also, on the whole, this material is far from basic. The material on electromechanical machines and control theory is usually taught in junior or senior undergraduate courses.Thus, this book would be most helpful to a professional or someone returning to graduate school for a master's degree in electrical engineering who needs some review on material that they have previously mastered but possibly forgotten. Unfortunately, as the other reviewer pointed out, this book is chock full of errors, thus rendering the book pretty much useless in the problem solving department. If a revised second edition of this book ever comes out with corrections to all of the current errors, I would recommend it to the target audience I have already mentioned, but definitely not to undergraduate engineers who are seeing this material for the first time+books
Rambling+N+I don't claim to be near as knowledgeable as the author, but this book rambled forever and I don't feel it ever addressed the issue raised in its title.  I got nothing out of it.  Probably just over my head+books

I have been concerned about the products that I use for cleaning for a while and this book gave me a great one-stop resource to start doing something about it.

Fans of Island of the Blue Dolphins: Stay Away From Zia+N+Longtime fans of Scott O'Dell's classic Island of the Blue Dolphins, do yourself a favor and avoid this lackluster sequel.  Island of the Blue Dolphins was one of my favorite books as a kid.  I must've read it at least a dozen times.  Somehow, I didn't find out that it had a sequel until years later.  Intrigued by the idea of a sequel to Island, which kind of ends on a cliffhanger, I read Zia.  I was interested in seeing how Scott O'Dell would handle what happens to Karana when she is finally rescued off the island after being stranded for 18 years.  As you probably know, Island of the Blue Dolphins was based on a true story, but the facts are few about the real Lost Woman.  So how would the talented writer Scott O'Dell concoct what happens to Karana?  The result, Zia, is terribly disappointing.  For starters, fans of Karana won't have much to read about.  At least half of the book deals with her niece and nephew trying to go to the island to rescue her.  The story is told completely from the niece's point of view.  We never get to hear what Karana herself thought about experiencing a new land and being reunited with people after so many years, and the sadness she must have faced at finding that her tribe was gone.  We learn almost nothing about what happened to Karana's father and sister, just that her sister's children have ended up orphans in a missionary.  And sadly, there's nothing interesting about Karana's niece Zia and her brother.  They merely serve as plot devices to stretch this paper-thin story out over 100 pages or so.  I now appreciate the "cliffhanger" ending of Island of the Blue Dolphins in its perfect simplicity.  It is better to leave the story when Karana leaves the island, and let it be.  Your own imagination about what it was like for Karana to live at a missionary where no one spoke her language and there was no trace of her tribe left is better than the depressing depiction of her life in Zia.  I wish I could erase Zia from my mind.  Zia truly is a sequel that should not have been written+books
An Excellent Overview+P+This work grabs you immediately with its description of the "standstill" procedure.  A patient is placed into a coma, the blood and body chilled and then the heart actually stopped while the surgeon skillfully digs around in the grey matter.  Fascinating stuff.    The author is a journalist obviously awed by Dr. Spetzler and all that he (and others) have accomplished at the Barrow Institute in Phoenix--the book is primarily a story of Dr. Spetzler's career and secondarily the developing science of neurosurgery.  The reader is treated to descriptions of the daily life of residents--rounds, M&M conferences, surgical procedures, etc.  There are the obligatory descriptions of the hideously expensive gadgetry and imaging technology that has made modern neurosurgery possible.  But something was missing.  In attempting to simultaneously cover the entire field of neurosurgery (as well as a curious diversion into the history of Phoenix) this book lost some of its punch.  This could easily have been an incredibly interesting biography of Dr. Spetzler (and if anyone writes one--I'm buying it), or a surgical techno-thriller about standstill procedures curing otherwise hopeless cases .  Better yet, a treatise on the cost/benefit tradeoffs presented by modern medicine with its increasing dependence upon pricey machines.  Not to mention the peculiar danger of saving a patient from a horrible aneurysm only to find that his or her personality is irrevocably changed--and not for the better.  Unfortunately, the work was somewhat diluted by its lack of focus.  Nevertheless, highly recommended+books
Braiding: Easy Styles+P+Great book, easy to read. Lots of information about different hair types and braiding tips. Step-by-step instruction on braiding techniques and  braiding styles for all age groups and ethnic backgrounds. If you're into hair cosmetology this is a must have.+books
Kids don't  want to spend the time coloring+N+I purchased this book for my 2nd grade classroom.  With a few exceptions, the kids didn't want to take the time necessary to color in all the designs.  They didn't mind doing the math, it was only the coloring that they rushed through.  I was disappointed because it seemed like a way to work some fun into the math lesson, but alas, it didn't work out that way+books
Mosby's Review  Mental Health Nursing+N+As a nursing major the book was difficult to get through.  Possibily due to trouble outside of school.  Definitly not easy reading, but lots of good information.  I recommend this for anyone who is thinking about nursing+books
The Children Speak+P+Finally,, this book was just what I have been looking for.  I've been diligently searching for information on how my lesbianism would effect my  daughter and the sterile studies I found just didn't seem to satisfy my  quest.   I found comfort from this book and  in knowing who she becomes  depends on all the  factors of parenting and not just the fact that I'm a  lesbian.  This collection outweighs the studies because the honesty of the  writers provided rare and precious information.  I hope volume two is in  the works and perhaps we will hear from some more artificial insemination  babies.  Thanks to the writers and editors for letting these voices be  heard loud and proud+books
Great aeronautical reference. Great price.+P+Althought written in 1959, this book covers many subjects related to aeronautical knowledge which are still in use today. High speed aerodynamics & aircraft performance are also covered. You dont have to be a naval aviatior for this book.        +books
Excellent catuionary tale; funny and lively+P+Not too many children's authors could get away with a story in which a bad little boy is eaten up by a lion, but Sendak handles this potentially unsettling story line with a master's touch.   Children will love the repetition of "I don't care," which seems to be Pierre's response to everything, and the varied rhyme scheme keeps the text from becoming a monotonous set of couplets.   After his exasperated parents leave him home alone (the picture of them walking away from Pierre's perspective might actually be more of a threat to the listener than being eaten), a lion shows up at his house. The foolhardy Pierre is not impressed in the slightest, and won't be cowed from his trademark line when the lion asks him if he would like to be eaten. After Pierre's parents return home, they figure out what happened, assault the lion, and take him to the hospital, where a chastened Pierre is extracted uninjured.   Sendak is one of those authors whose work continues to shine more brightly than the hundreds of derivative picture books out there. Like Shel Silverstein and Roald Dahl, there is a hint of wickedness to his work, but it's all in good fun.   This is a classic, pure and simple; a complete Sendak collection is a good idea for any child!+books
Self Reflection+P+I have had this deck for many years now and have not found any better cards to date. They just tell it how it is, simply, without fuss, and without blame. If you don't want to see your reflection, then don't look in the mirror! They articulate human nature exquisitely. Mine come everywhere with me. I used them professionally for a few years very sucessfully. I wouldn't be without them. They are the best friend you could ever have. If you want to develop your better nature/spiritual side, then buy some today. I am not so sure about the enclosed booklet, but I found the book - The Secrets of the Tarot, a valuable backup. I still see new insights into them even now, and I am sure that I will for years to come+books
An excellent introduction to stochastic calculus+P+This my recommendation for people who want to learn stochastic calculus for the first time. The virtue of this book is that it keeps matters simple,well grounded, and intuitive enough to hook the newcomers in the subject. Once you get comfortable enough and want to learn technical detail necessary for scholarly research, there are other excellent expositions such as Karatzas and Shreve(1998) and Protter(1990). Some reviews complained that this book is limited to stochastic integration with respect to Brownian motion, but that is precisely why I recommend this book. By starting with Browning motion readers can form concrete mental image of stochastic integration and get ready to stride to more general setting if necessary. Another virtue of this  book is the plenty (easy) exercise problems. Working through them is perhaps the best way to learn stochastic calculus.+books
lack of examples and horrible explanations make a ghastly diffE text+N+Because the guy who initiated the project of writing the book is here at Rice, the rest of us are unlucky enough to have to use this book. If your class uses this book, prepare to go to class. All the time. That's because if you fall behind, the book does not do a good job of explaining things to you. Examples are generally vague and only apply to a few types of problems provided at the back of each section. A lot of the time, I'd find myself stumped on a problem, looking back, and realizing there was no example problem for me to get ideas from.  Yes there are lots of problems and that's good, in a way. But what's the point of having all those problems if the book never teaches you how to do them?  Furthermore, it is a poorly written book. Generally, reading through the book is like searching for a needle in a haystack. Literally speaking. You spend all that time figuring out what the authors talk about and once you figure it out, it was not even worth all that time.  So go to class. All the time. If the prof isnt that great, get yourself another workbook. I havent seen Schaum's but I'm pretty sure they'll do a better job on covering the topics than this text does+books
Greatful for this book+P+Gives you so much insight into your own world.  Thank you for this book.  It has helped me see the truth as it really is.  Not how I would want to see it+books
Just found my childhood copy.+P+I loved this book as a child.  I read it over and over.  The pictures were great.  Sort of scary but that was half the fun+books
Good history, but.......+N+No doubt about it.  This book covers the history of the Border Patrol.  However, it falls far short of what it ostensibly bills itself and ends up more as a "fluff piece" than anything else.  As someone who has not only served as a Senior Border Patrol Agent (13 years) but also a Border Patrol union president and outspoken critic of the agency, I have studied this agency inside and out without the affects of tunnel vision that typically accompany the job (many say a necessity).  Pacheco, as an active agent (when he wrote the book at least), appears headed in the right direction with the book and then suddenly veers off target.  His somewhat ambiguous message that border security is a difficult task is obviously an attempt to straddle the line (I apologize for the pun) so as not to appear too contentious or controversial.  Did he need to seek agency approval for publication since he was actively employed?  If so, then the credibility issue leaps out and the book is worth the historical content alone if nothing else.  If he did not need agency approval and was truly writing without restraint, then he failed to accurately convey the real state of the Border Patrol and border security.    Simply put, the Border Patrol, as with most of the Homeland Security subcomponents is disintegrating.  Remember the incompetence of FEMA (a Homeland Security subcomponent)?  Well, multiply that incompetence times ten.  Heard about the poor morale of FEMA employees?  Multiply that problem by one-hundred and you have an accurate picture of the Border Patrol.  A Border Patrol in which the vast majority of otherwise employable agents spend ninety-percent of their time trying to get out.  Those that choose to stay in do so only because of the comparatively worse off agencies in DHS.  The bottom line is that as a former agent, I lose sleep at night knowing what I know.     Pacheco did cover the rigorous training regimen accurately even if it bordered on propaganda.  That alone may attract candidates to the difficult and completely unrewarding position of U.S. Border Patrol Agent.  The field stories are completely unappealing to anyone who served more than a week in a law enforcement position unless they are reading about their own exploits.    Read the book for enjoyment and homage.  Just don't expect critical analysis.  In fact, this book would be an enjoyable read at Stewarts Bridge (for you IB agents in San Diego).+books
Refinement Needed+N+There's a ton of paper in this book, overboard, in my opinion. Wading through the pages in search of a hike is downright laborious.  I've taken quite a few of the Sierra hikes and the information hasn't been detailed enough to really give me a feel for what to expect on the trail. They miscalculated the mileage and sometimes the elevation. I think it would be a better book if they chopped out half of the listings and concentrated on the truly best hikes in California+books
A Bore+N+Each story has a different author...however they all use the same verbage.  Their either all friends or the same person.  I do not like this book nor does my husband+books
What was country about the majority of the stories????+N+A book full of heartwarming stories from country stars, singers, writers,  and listeners, or so the back of the book said.  As I read some sentimental  stories, and some down right boring stories I questioned how more than half  of these stories got into the `Country1 edition of the Chicken Soup series.   I loved about three stories, liked about ten, and was puzzled by all the  other entries+books
suks comepletely+N+this joke book suks. if i can give it any star i want, i would give it a -10 stars. i never actually bought it, but i borrowed it from a friend. i needed a joke book for my anouncements on the intercom every morning, and it only lasted 3 days and i ran out of good jokes. some of the jokes arnt appropriate and most of them dont make sense. if your gonna buy a joke book, dont buy this+books
the worst!+N+This book was a huge disappointment. Not only wasn't it funny to me, it has absolutely nothing funny for kids. Too bad its not worth the return shipping charges. I threw it out+books
...why?+N+i would like to know what kind of a wuss needs to use a stradegy guide for a FIRST PERSON SHOOTER!?  i mean, they're pretty straightfoward - walk forward and kill all the bad guys you see!  how hard is that!?  Halo is an awesome game but it's REALLY not hard to figure out what to do!  i mean you'd have to be a complete MORON not to know what to do or where to go.  it tells you more than once what to do during the game - you got that extrememly annoying Cortana yacking in your ear pretty much non-stop, tellin' ya what to do.  but anyway i'm done ranting at you wusses+books
Are we not the supermen?  Super duper supermen?+N+Do you feel different from people around you?  Do they resent your ingenuity?  Have you been kept from achieving your full potential by tradition-bound brutes who live only for base needs?  Do you long for the company of others like yourself, who, tragically but inevitably, are biologically destined to wipe these shorter, darker subhumans from the face of the earth?  Congratulations!  You are either in the aryan nations or the Clan of the Cave Bear fan club, possibly both!  (I exaggerate- you could be a nineteenth century English settler in Australia, or a Boer in South Africa, or maybe you just like Larry Niven, but that's beside the point)  I can forgive Auel for the historical inaccuracies in the book.  In the late 1970's when she did her research, we didn't have the genomic tools to reconstruct the lives of Neanderthals, and even now enough controversy persists to keep the discussion page lively over at Wikipedia.  Ultimately we'll never know for sure what the paleolithic was like, and Auel's is if nothing else a vivacious fictional suggestion.  Similarly, her bloated, almost puffy writing style is excusable in a first-time author, though one wonders what parasite infected her editor.  I haven't read her more recent works, but I imagine she has probably improved.  Even with the pendulous sentences Clan is not unreadable.  What infuriates me is the casually racist subtext of the story, nowhere critiqued or even acknowledged.  The story reads like a near-literal historicization of Helena Blavatsky's Secret Doctrine on the fall of the "aryans"- who interbred with "subhumans" introducing the world to, oh I dunno, domination by the unworthy, blind tradition, suppression of the individual, all the hallmarks of the book's neanderthal culture.  Of course, even in this the blond-haired blue-eyed Ayla is innocent, overpowered by a brutish thug.  Against this master narrative, all the admittedly interesting side notes about plant-based medicine and flintknapping make no impression.  I would recommend anyone interested in paleontology take a trip to a museum or cruise the internet, and give Auel's books a wide berth.  Also?  Enough rape scenes already+books
Don't waste your time or money.......+N+I loved the first Carole Matthews novel I read, "For Better or Worse", and picked this up in an airport hoping to be entertained once again. It kept me entertained while on a three and a half hour flight, but only because I didnt' have anything else to do. I am the type of person who has to finish a book once they start but it was really hard for me to even pick this one up again after getting off the plane.    I totally disagree with the premise behind the whole thing and found it completely pointless. There were no redeeming qualities and few parts in the book even worth mentioning. To me, Matthews expects you to feel sorry for a woman whose married lover decided he needed to be with his wife and kids instead of leaving them for her. I think this is a horrible/unrealistic messgage.   If you want to read something good, pick up a Jane Green novel instead. +books
Book review+P+It's an educational book to read. My child and I like reading it together+books
Wonderful Handbook+P+I'm new at reading about energy healing modalities, so I have little to compare it to.  I found this book to be a really nice book to learn more about Healing Touch and how to be a practitioner.  It has some wonderful stories, some that even made me cry.  I still have a long way to go to make this work for me, but it's the beginning of a new awareness in my life+books
Um, the 50's are over...+N+Robert Putnam's book bemoans the declne in "civic participation" among Americans since its heyday in the 50's and 60's.  Although few would argue that bridge clubs aren't what they used to be, who would have predicted the rise of 20,000 member mega-churches back in 1962?  This underlines the basic problem with this book: it focuses too much on what constituted "communities" and "activities" in the past, without looking at how people form new and different kinds of communities today.  While I agree that television has dramatically increased the couch potato index, and participation in traditional FORMAL organizations has declined, I would argue that membership and participation in new kinds of groups that are more relevant to people in the 21st century has risen.  For example, while young people famously are less likely to vote in our dual-party system, college students today volunteer more that any generation before them.  In addition, while participation in mainline Protestant churches has stedily declined, engagement in evangelical churches has risen dramatically.  While I personally feel that the sterile suburban, drive-everywhere-in-my-SUV existance is soul crushing, and the popularity of reality TV may be a sign of the apocolypse, I also don't pine for the days where mom was expected to stay home with the kids and go to the bridge club once a week, while dad worked 9-5, returned home to supper, and went to the Men's Club on Tuesdays at 8.  And while Putnam's basic premise may resonate with many, its fetishization of days past blunts the strength of his overall argument+books
I bought every edition of this book for 5 years+N+and when didn't buy a new edition and I got out from behind my computer and started making cold calls, I got published. I know the pain of writing for so very long with no recognition. All I can say is that maybe this book can make you feel better temporarily, thinking you have some kind of inside track that nobody else has (LOL), but the only way to get published is to make your own inside track. This book won't help you do it+books
43 years later, we get to know the man, Al Shepard.+P+Alan Shepard was the first American man in space - this occured on May 5th, 1961 with John F. Kennedy in office.  I find it amazing that it took 43 long years to finally get some semblence of the affair in writing.  Well, like the old saying goes - better late than never. Author, Neal Thompson did an excellent job of explaining the growing up years of one of the most famous aviators in the world, Alan B. Shepard.  He was courageous enough to print the truth about the man who was supremely confident in his physical as well as intellectual abilities.  But all great men have their downfalls, as is well-documented in this book. The first man in space may have only been up there for 15 minutes, but it was this brief shining moment of accurate performing that launched the legend that is Alan Shepard.  He conquered Meniere's disease by having to first conquer and overcome his (bogus) Christian Science faith - - - and - - - no surprise, he was cured under the famous healing hand of Dr. House in Los Angeles.   I was intrigued to discover he almost commanded Apollo 13, but was reassigned to the next mission instead, due to preparation contingencies.  This decision saved Shepard the near-disasterous mission that we know occured on Apollo 13 - what a close call! Shepard always did display this lucky streak that never stopped. He also might have been up on Apollo 1 - but his ear problem started around that time and he was grounded. It's as if a higher power was looking out for him and doing creative things to keep Shepard alive and well. His ride was on Apollo 14; he was the commander and he did another perfect job, what else is new?  What else did we expect from Alan Shepard? His wife, Louise stood by his side, in good times and in bad for 50 years - she had a lot of competition out there with the Rocket groupies.  Not to mention the stress of living with a high risk occupation. But he always managed to call her at 5:00pm most nights, except for those times he was staying at the Apollo Motel # 14. This book was so interesting and mesmerizing - I read it non-stop for 2 days.....all 399 pages of it. I could not put it down - I even drug it to work with me today. There are some nice photographs in there, but I would like to see about 1000 more of the life and times of Alan Shepard. Some people are born to live lives of extreme risk, challenge  and unbelievable success.....and the rest of us can only imagine what it must have felt like to be in their shoes. Shepard's life was very exciting indeed, and I wonder why on Earth did it take 43 years for this wonderful book to be published?  THe truth may be a painful and bitter thing to taste, but it's the way things panned out in real life. They had a huge ego and they stroked that ego one times too many.  Why do risk takers take so many risks?  Well, I suppose it comes with the territory of being a risk taker in the first place. TODAY ---All of our famous Apollo astronaughts are aging; many have passed on to the big rocket ship in the sky, so reading about these incredible men and the incredible lives they lived is a real treat for all persons who wonder about such immense challenges.  It is my sincere hope that all of them have books published about their biographies...they have lived and dared to fulfill outrageous dreams.  THey are what make this country great in the eyes of the universe. Before long, the Apollo moon walkers will be gone from the face of this beautiful blue Earth. We need to know them - at least by biographies - we need to hear thier stories and understand their feelings before their ultimate count-down to zero is counted. Please read this book!  It's an excellent book! It's the year 2004 and I can now say I know alot more about this man that held the facination of millions.....Alan Shepard - he was a great man who did great things, and lived life to the fullest possible+books
Please... Leave Godel alone!+N+Godel's theorem has been entirely overused! Lets get one thing straight people: all that theorem says is that in any decently powerful formal system you are forced to decide between either have a complete but inconsistent system, or have an incomplete but consistent system! It has no relevance to AI, so go find some other argument to bolster your bio-bigotry+books
A Phd who deserves the respect he gets+P+As a matter of fact Martin Zweig is one of the few Phds who's "able" to explain even somewhat complicated subjects in plain words. The same thing can't be said about the contemporary authors of various market, finance or economics books published over the last years.     Hands down, this is one of the best and one of the most (again)  simple books ever written on Wall Street. It provided me with new insights on different aspects of trading and economics in general, like the Four percent model indicator, the Monetary model, the Mutual Funds cash/assets ratio, the three crucial conditions for bear markets. There were also other brief and concise ideas which seem to stand the test of time, like "It's ok to monitor the crowd and go against it, but you only want to do so when the crowd is extremely one-sided", "Recognizing the relationship between trends and the industries that might benefit from them can lead to above normal returns", "If you could just eliminate the worst 10% of all stocks and choose even randomly from the rest, you would certainly beat the market". And the most surprising of them all (at least to me): "There seems to be some inborn reasoning in Wall Street that better profits mean higher stock prices, but this simply is not true in aggregate. The best gains made in bull markets tend to come in the first six months of a fresh bull market, when profits are usually declining".     But when it comes to the brass tacks of his methodology, I think the best part of this book is the one about scanning the financial section. His method of picking the winners by simply checking the latest quarterly figures in company sales and earnings in the daily financial section of The Wall Street Journal or The New York Times and the process he goes through afterwards, until deciding in the end which ones to buy is simple, yet very powerful.     I don't know why, but almost every single page of this book reminded me of the legendary Jesse Livermore and his valuable and immortal lessons. After reading M. Zweig's book you'll never invest the same way as before. "Winning on Wall Street" is an intelligent and insightful investing book, yet simple to understand. Rather than trying to razzle-dazzle the reader, this book explains why it is so important to stick to simple concepts and rules such as " buy strength and sell weakness, stay in gear with the tape, the trend is your friend, etc"; rules you have read and heard about a gazillion times before, but which are so easy to violate! As a trader once said: "The market is the train, so be the caboose".  +books
More Pablum For The Dummies+N+I guess Albom will just keep churning out this psychobabble but I'm done with him.  At least I can say I never paid for any of his Oprahlit. Just wasted time at a library. Please don't make this huckster one cent richer. Buy something more edifying.  Like toilet paper+books
Women are from vaginas and men are too+N+F this self-help industry crap. Quasi-astrological poppycock at its worst. I can tell this book clamps on to the mind and squeezes it to death merely by reading the cliched title. Humans are far more complex than the hack Man-Warrior/Female-Maiden title what's-his-name gives them. And remember, this "doctor," is quietly making mucho mucho bucks off your poor purchase. Your goddamned ancestors never needed a book to run their lives, so why do you? Let's push all the life coaches off cliffs and put the self-help industry to the torch. That's a great start to a sane life+books
Stereotypes and Unbelievable Storyline+N+Much too stereotypical for my tastes and the storyline is not only unbelievable- it drags on and on. Sadly, from reading some of the reviews on Amazon, Mr. Hiassen's stereotypical, over the top books on the people of Florida are read by many as real and some reviewers state that they want to visit Florida after reading Mr. Hiaasen's books. This is sad- that  people actually believe that the state is chock full of characters like Twilly Spree, Clinton Skink Tyree and Palmer Stoat. Where does he get these names? During my 25 years in Florida, the people I met  had names like Robert, Jim, Mary, Chris, Michael, etc. By the way, for those of you who think I am just a Floridian with sour grapes- I have been a proud resident of the Northeast for over 20 years. I just dislike stereotyping of groups of people. It causes prejeudice, misunderstanding and in extreme cases- hatred. Read some Christopher Moore for your humor fix. He doesn't stereotype and although his stories are over the top in his own way, he makes them believable and fun+books
disappointing and shallow+N+The two best essays in this book had been previously published (perhaps in Oprah's magazine?). Most of the rest were shallow, not long-term friendships, and one even sounded like her hook-up of the month. Don't bother+books
Not realistic+N+Robert Allen is one of the many real estate "gurus" in the world who probably makes more money selling you the "secrets" to real estate then actually practicing his own advice.  I have noticed that people either hate his stuff or love it.  I am guessing those who love his stuff haven't actually tried to do it.  The book has a lot of wealth building ideas, but many of them are dangerous to the beginning investor and really require a lot of experience and knowledge to pull off successfully, which is not the typical reader of his books.  He is looking for the person who needs to find the "magic bullet" for easy wealth and success, but unfortunately you won't find any magic bullets or fantastic money making secrets in this book.  What you will find is a bunch of average ideas that are painted with a very deceptive picture of how much work, money, and experience you actually need to be successful.  He spends a lot of time discussing real estate investing, which is where he got his start, but a beginning investor should understand that what he teaches is hard, takes a lot of time, and requires experience.  You will probably need some of your own money and will need to have good skills in sales, marketing, construction, and general business.  Some of the actual investing ideas are ok, but not easily and it certainly not without a lot of work, which will exclude a lof of people.  He also offers advice on investing in rare coins and while I know individuals who do this and some actually make a lot of money doing it most people should understand that doing this requires   a lot of experience and knowledge and it not an investment that should be undertaken without a lot of information.  Overall his ideas are average, but they require a lot of work and information and in many cases your own money to truly make them work.  If you can take any of ONE of his ideas and make a lot of money doing it you will definately earn it through the amount of hard work, knowledge learned, and experience you must earn.  It will not be as easy as Mr. Allen makes it out to be and will definately take more time then he suggests.  If you already do some of the types of investing he discusses and you know what you are getting into then you could read the book for a few average ideas but you won't get much more from it.+books
Couldn't finish it...+N+I tried many times to finish this book because once I buy it and start it, I hate to just walk away from it. BUT, this book did it. I was never really interested in the plot, I thought the writing was very basic, elementary actually, slow, and just plain boring. I tried on more than one occasion to pick it back up, but I never did get into to, making this the only book I've ever started and put back on my shelf with no interest in finishing+books
Great ideas and inspiration+P+As proud new owners of an antique home in Marblehead, MA -- built circa 1720 -- we were thrilled to find Treena Crochet's "Colonial Style." It helped greatly in getting our creative juices in motion.  And the author even took time to respond to my e-mail inquiry about a ceiling issue which had us stumped.  The book is a real pleasure to own -- just like our antique home! Ann and Mik+books
Solid foundation and background+P+Not only has this professor studied the country of Iraq, he has studied its language and its history.  Unlike many authors writing about Iraq, he has lived there.  He was also a policy advisor during the Kennedy administration.  Given this, he has a better perspective than most who have written about it.  In highlighting linguistics, Polk points out that not understanding the language will inevitably lead to misunderstanding, which will in turn lead to bad decisions.  Further, by highlighting the history of the country, he underlines the good times and the bad, and in doing so, he points out what is likely to happen.  The last part of the book discusses the current situation in Iraq and the United States' involvement.  Here, the author applies the history and language to show what can be expected.  However, part of this also goes into critique.  Regardless on your take of the United States' presence in Iraq, this book is a good primer for understanding Iraq+books
Made in America+N+I am so sorry I hadn't taken the time to read the customer's reviews of Made in America and The Lost Continent, prior to buying them.  Frankly, I'm not sure which of these two books is more disappointing.  The only thing I was able to take away from them was the idea that Bill Bryson thinks hammering and bashing anything North American (USA only) is considered extremely good fun and humorous+books
agenda here?+N+Well in my opinion, there is no longer any doubt that some things appear to be flying in our skies, and some people have had some unusual experiences (mostly disturbing, but some apparrently enlightening), but the question is, is it all as it seems?  The fact of the matter is, various military branches from around the globe have real hardware that could easily fool us.  Holographic projections can and are used to place images within our skys (this is related to controversial theories surrounding the 911 events); there are devices that can manipulate brain waves and neuronal excitation to have people hallucinate any scenario; advanced, drug manipulated hypnotic techniques can control memories and behaviour; implants have been around for decades and have even gone mainstream now (Verichip).  I'm not saying that other lifeforms don't exist in the Universe (far from it), and perhaps there are a number of entities here on Earth carrying out agendas, but this idea that there are little, menacing Greys abducting us for various sinister reasons without immense COLLUSION seems suspect.  It smells of classic fear mongering that the elite love to push on us.  Historically, there's been the Barbarians, Huns, Mongols,  Pagans, Jews, Christians, Vikings, black Natives, Cannabals, red Natives, Mexicans, Germans, Nazis, Communists, now the Arabs and the next logical conclusion is some evil force off planet because they have used all the boogey men on Earth.  Even President Reagan set us up for this scenario in an infamous speech in the late 80's.  The fact is that with known technology (not including whatever they may have that has not been leaked), they could quite easily pull the hoax off.  Even genetic manipulation and cloning is much further advanced and PRACTICED (albeit "underground") than most people can fathom.  What has become another fact is the major extent to which the UFO community has been infiltrated and compromised, of which Strieber has been front and centre at various times.  My belief is that Strieber is part of this fear mongering campaign, sponsored by the elite and carried out by various military and government groups.  In this book, his "hard-evidence" is flimsey and suspicious.  For example, why wouldn't super advanced Aliens using implants design them such that they are entirely organic and of shapes that mimic human tissue (thus not showing up on any X-ray, MRI, CT, etc)?  And design them such that they quickly break down when removed from the body?  Surely, this would be child's play for Alien scientists?  Why no major discussion or mention of the human military, or NAZI connection with abductions?  There seems to be a growing number of victims who are recalling strange "fragments" of memories that are slipping through various memory covers.  Why are they mentioning cooperation of human doctors and nurses with the Greys?  Why are they mentioning swastikas and other known military insignias on uniforms?  Why are some speaking English, others German?  Why is there a connection with deep, underground bases and specifically Antartica?  These are things Strieber never mentions, which I find curious.  My point is, things are happening, but it has become nearly impossible to ascertain what, and Strieber's books seem to cloud the issues and possibly even advance certain agendas.      +books
What a great teaching tool - nice biographical vignettes+P+I am one of those who loves Booknotes and Book-TV and feels a real loss when my schedule keeps me away from them (yes, I can pick them up on the C-SPAN websites, but it just isn't quite the same).  These books are just one of the additional reasons some of us refer to Brian Lamb as Saint Brian.  The chapters are digests of the information gleaned during the actual Booknotes broadcasts.  Each one is from an individual author and in this case, it is on the lives of famous Americans.  There are something like 80 to 85 of these biographical vignettes.  Some of them are autobiographical when the author being interviewed about their book was also a notable American in their own right.  We all know Mr. Lamb's unique style of quantum interviewing (one can never predict the precise location of his next question).  These edited and assembled pieces have a somewhat more organized and focused feel, but there is still a bit of the Cooks Tour approach to each subject.  Having watched many of the shows from which these articles were made and also having read several of the books by these authors, I can still say that even when the material here is familiar it is still fun to dash through because it is so concisely presented and decently edited.  When the material is unfamiliar it is very delightful and an invitation to more study and investigation.  I am not only happy to have this dandy book, I am actually grateful for it.  It is a marvelous tool for introducing children to biographical subjects!  The book also has an index and a list of all the Booknotes programs through the publishing date of the book+books
Hannity and this book are an example of nonthinking+N+American lives.  Hannity receives his talking points every day from the RNC, and then repeats them like the Summoner from "Canterbury Tales," repeating his two or three Latin phrases.  Hannity's phrases: - Liberals are giving comfort to the enemy when questioning our president when our soldiers are in harm's way.  - Liberals don't want to defend America and fought Homeland Security every step of the way (when it was Bush who fought it)  - Howard Dean hates republicans, he is unhinged, so is Hillary, Al Gore, John Kerry, and every republican except for Ben Nelson and Joe Lieberman.  - Osama bin laden was offered up to Clinton on a silver platter. (never happened)  So, as Al Franken says, Hannity knows 11 facts, all of which are outright lies, or misrepresentations, so please don't try to confuse him with any nuance or qualifications to the 11 facts he knows.  Don't waste your money on this book - it, and he, are the reason the right and the left can no longer talk to each other.  He is laughing all the way to the bank with his tax cut, begotten on his listeners' backs+books
My first J. Kellerman novel. I'll try another one, but...+N+I'm not a fan of psychologists as protagonists in mysteries and I'm even less interested when they deal with children. Children in peril is not entertaining. That said, however, I picked up "Rage" at the airport. And thus, my first Jonathan Kellerman novel.  This was a dumb story and far from believable. I could not suspend disbelief. If you read mysteries, the bad guy screams "IT'S ME! IT'S ME!" in the first 30 pages. I was hoping I was wrong, but unfortunately, that was not the case. So, I tagged along and watched Alex and Milo chase obvious red herrings, useless leads, eat some donuts, theorize and solve the mystery!  I cannot mention how bad I thought the story was without giving away the plot, but let's just say that the antagonists and their behavior is just not believeable over the course of so many years.   I'll try an earlier J. Kellerman book. Maybe it will be better+books
Yes it is an art!+P+Greene has clearly drawn out the ways of the seducer.  Most of the men and women in here are naturals at seduction and are not consciously doing the principles taught.  But those that tend to mess up their seductions can learn quite a few things from these people.  With everything i teach at my site The Seduction Bible, i still believe that this book is excellent for those looking to score that one special girl.  Those wanting to learn how to go out to a bar to pick up a woman are better off on sites like mine.  But this book deserves 5 stars+books
What you don't know IS hurting you+P+Although most of modern day America will not want to hear the research this book relates, it is fascinating - a little infuriating, and very interesting.  The facts and information presented on our health care system and mostly about our Standard American Diet have led me to a complete diet change - and I feel GREAT now!  I also know I'm doing what is best for my body.  The book is easy to read and understandable even with the research statistics.  I would encourage anyone who is interested in their health to read this, but be warned - you may not like what you learn. +books
Bravo!+P+This book is amazing. It explains every energy principle before explaing how to use it. It gives the necessary understanding for both left brained and right brained people. Personally, it gave me the missing piece about manifesting: How to eliminate the inner "chat" or "noise" that prevented me from focusing in what I wanted. It is an excellent reference bor beginners and advanced reality manifestors.  It also gave me many advanced techniques for creating and manifesting thoughts in an easy to understand language but yet in a very inspiring and powerful way.  I have a big pile of excelent resources on the topic, but I definetely need to give an standing ovation to "Professional Dreamer". It is really a must. The results are astounding+books
Spellbound+N+I am returning this book. I have not read it, I am angry the book has 81 pages , I am not sure it is an entire book. You had the audacity to charge me $ 4.98 when on the face of this book it is marked $2.99. If that is the way you do business, I don't want to do business with you .I feel cheated and disappointed+books
Zero stars if there was an option!!+N+This was my first Jance novel and probably my last. I am an open minded progressive reader of many novels and believe that we are all entitled to free speech and thought but throughout this book, men are relegated to subordinate if not subservient roles which is clearly not mainstream or believable. Many false assertions regarding the Catholic church abound with a specific reference to pediphile priests being dumped in New Mexico as if it was a known fact. The most offensive reference being that God clearly must be a woman. Do not buy from this author if morally conservative+books
www.valderbeebeshow.com+P+Living his passion and dreams, Johnson's story is told vicariously by journalist B. Pulley.  Entrepreneurs can absorb much from the determination and success of Bob Johnson+books
Practices What He Preaches+N+So, the author doesn't like Walmart selling decent merchandise at decent prices? I could tell that before I read this book. The 20 dollar price tag for a 160-page paperback book gave it away+books
Spectacular!+P+As a designer in the New York metropolitan area, I thoroughly appreciate the effort that must have gone into making this book, and in particular its illustrations. They are detailed, accurate (as far as I can tell), and above all informative in a way that infrastructure diagrams from other books are not. It is noted that TW:AOAC's lead designer found inspiration in a chance encounter with famed statistician/graphic artist Edward Tufte - a credible claim, if this book is any indicator. Conveying so much about the city yet basking in white space, these spreads are consistently excellent. Ascher's writing, too, is impeccable, and while a free-market standpoint is appropriately engaged in her commentary, the invaluabity of New York's public bureaus is not given short shrift.  Indeed, where politics have clouded issues of development for the city, Ms. Ascher has deftly surmised the issue and given it full and fair treatment. As a major in economics and a professional graphic designer, I am happily forced to recommend this book+books
Presenting to clients+P+This is a great resource for quoting those little sound bites in a design presentation that can really help take the subjectivity out of color choices. A "must" for the design studio+books
A pale copy+N+It seems to me that this author is trying to tell us he is tired of Lucas Davenport.  I feel that he wants to transplant the best of Davenport to a new hero.If so, he failed.  If that is the case, he failed. There are long stretches of boring reading and suddenly a spark of the old haro comes through to us.  Worth to read if you cannot fall asleep; after some half a dozen pages, you can. How sad..+books
Remains solid+P+Got this when it came out and gave it a read. Three years have passed and I just referred to it to support writing a paper on technology. The details are good and the higher level dialogue do a nice job of getting the message across without belaboring anything. If you are about the web and doing business, this is worth the bucks and time+books
Almost Pornographic+N+I enjoy reading books of trivia and fun facts, but I didn't even make it through the first chapter before I put this book down in disgust. Almost every entry had to do with sex or male endowments. As I was flipping through the book, I found x-rated pictures and drawings that I would hate to have to explain to my children if they were to pick up this book. I never would have bought this book if I had seen it in a bookstore, and I regret throwing it in the trash before I could see if I could get my money back+books
They know their stuff...but the book could have been much better+N+The material is fine. They cover most of the basics. However, I found the book to be extremely repetitious. They would often say the same thing over and over, page after page. It was comical really. The book could easily have been edited down to half its size.  The construction of the book lacked any organization at all. I got the feeling that the many topics in it were written at different times and slapped together when it was time to put it together for publishing. You could just as easily read it from back to front because there really is no flow to the book.  I also had a problem with this Abraham thing. It was kind of a turnoff really. I understand it's a nice marketing angle, but enough already. I hope no one out there really believes that this info came from some supernatural entity. It's too bad, really; the writers seem knowledgable enough to have written on this subject without the need for a gimmick.+books
Christian fundamentalism dramatized+N+Even the avid "trekie" reader of the Star Trek science fiction novels, movies and television series must suspend disbelief, when he finds Captain Kirk saying "Beam me up, Scotty."  But the biblical literalist reading this book need make no such effort, when he reads in this book that Jesus will effectively beam millions of true Christians up to heaven in the world-wide "Rapture."  Though the characters and their roles are fictitious, the book specifically references the relevant biblical passages for the believer.   The story line opens with the chaotic moment of discovery after the historic mass Rapture event, and the remainder is a moral melodrama concluding with emotional born-again conversions.   In the September/October 2006 issue of Foreign Affairs Walt Mead writes that fundamentalists are not hospitable to the idea of gradual progress toward a secular utopia driven by technological advances and the cooperation of intelligent people of all religious traditions.    Instead fundamentalists separate themselves from the world and have a premillennial pessimism about prospects for social reform.  Billy Graham's biography by Strober notes that they criticized Graham's "new evangelism" for its inclusiveness and for its involvement in addressing social problems. Yet their separatism does not preclude proselytizing as portrayed in these novels by the "Tribulation Force" or as exemplified by Jerry Falwell's Moral Majority.  They are also committed to an apocalyptic vision of the end of the world and are hostile to international institutions such as the United Nations. Mead notes that it is no coincidence that the Left Behind novels show the Antichrist rising to power as the secretary-general of the United Nations.  The U.S. Statistical Abstract reports that the per capita numbers of fundamentalists are growing exponentially, while evangelicals and liberals - e.g. Southern Baptists, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Methodists - and Catholics are continuing their per capita declines.  Such data and the reported popularity of these Left Behind novels indicate fundamentalism's growing appeal in reaction to contemporary American society.  I see the readers who seriously respond to this book as the "left behind" in the backwash of the tidal flows of cultural change in modern American society, and as conservative Christians who believe it is better to stay behind.  And in not just a few respects, they may be wise to do so.  Thomas J. Hickey +books
Fiction, but non fiction+P+As a long time Civil War buff I found this book utterly fascinating. It takes the true story of General Sherman and his march to the sea and fictionalizes it just enough to make it   intriguing and even difficult for someone to put down who has little interest in the Civil War.  More importantly it explains the reason why he destroyed everything in his path. William Tecumseh Sherman was hated in the south and even today, to a great extent he still is.  However, his intent was by destroying the food supply, to shorten the war. He did succeed in his goal.  Read this book and you will have a true understanding of why the Civil War began and lasted as long as it did.+books
Author sells to minors - Should be rated at 0+N+This book is not a book for minors and no where on this book is a warning as it deals with Sex Magic, BDSM and drugs and even states, "there is nothing wrong with using mind altering drugs."  The author sold this book to a young minor without verification of age and without parental permission+books
Thank You James Patterson!+P+I love James Patterson and am thrilled that he wrote this book for the younger generation. I bought this book for my [...] year old son and he couldn't put it down. He loved it, and it was all he talked about. Now he's reading Schools Out Forever and is glued to that one too! I hope there will more books like these to follow! I am planning to read it myswelf when I finish reading the James Patterson book I am currently reading+books
1st CD is GREAT - Better know Italian from 2nd disc on or you'll be LOST !!!+N+This my first review on Amazon but I was compelled to write based on my experience with this course. The first CD is fantastic. It starts off slow and gives you a solid foundation to build upon as you move from lesson to lesson. Within a few weeks of driving back and forth to work I had mastered all the lessons on the CD and could easily translate the English phrases in the final review lesson into Italian. I was confident and had a good grasp on building sentences and nuances such as how words changed when the subject was masculine or feminine. My opinion is that most people write their review based on the first CD.  And then I put in the second CD. I thought there was some mistake, as if I had switched to a completely different Italian course. The slow, clear speaking narrators were gone and replaced with fast talking Italians who didn't repeat anything, and certainly didn't give you time to repeat in the pause. The assumption appeared to be that I already understood the language and this was merely a refresher course. Within ten minutes I knew this was no longer the course for me. I listened to the entire second CD just in case this was all a joke and at some point they would slow down and actually help me learn Italian. No such luck! I have gone back to using the first CD for practice while I wait for the Pimsleur Italian course to arrive+books
A Masterpiece+P+This book clearly explains the basic guidelines to becoming a millionaire and taking time to enjoy the little things. Michael LeBoeuf is a great author and knows how to get to the point. The dedication and pride that went into this book is tremendous and it clearly beams whenever you read a passage from any part of the book. Always following LeBoeuf's Law: "Invest your time actively and your assets passively." I advise everyone to do themselves a favor and buy this wonderful masterpiece. It's truly made me a better person+books
Essential Dickens+P+Great fun. Dickens' first novel, the first mass-market best seller in world history (coming on the heels of the invention of cheap paper). Essential reading for Victorian Literature and the evolution of Dickens' style. This edition (with footnotes and introduction, two appendices and maps) is fine in all respects, except that the print is too small+books
Beautiful Beginning / Painful (illogical) Ending+N+I hope the ending is illogical at least and is fiction. If thoughts are that powerful, they need to be resrained earlier. I don't know who survivied but he might feel very guilty about the others earlier and question if he had to survive. Logic can be quite painful when left alone, but sometimes it has to be+books
...Okay, I'll come clean.+N+You guessed it.  I'm a cracka from England that has no idea or grasp on African American life; therefore I'm really not qualified to give a justifiable review of this book.  I just figured I would chime in like all racist Saltines do.  Sorry+books
Poor analogies, and no real argument+N+Vanishing Voices does a good job of showing how larger languages are destroying smaller ones, and the methods of language death.  This is all pretty much common knowledge.  However, the authors fail in their attempt to give a reason as to WHY language death is something with which we should be concerned.  The only argument they put forth is in a ecological/enviromental analogy, which says that biological diversity is good and stable, therefore, linguistic diversity must.  However, they only go part way in their analogy and reject natural selection for languages.  They also show that linguistic diversity corresponds to environmental diversity, but state this has nothing to do with the inexcessiblity of the areas.  The violin-playing and loaded words are hard to stomach if you are looking for good social science.  I would not suggest the book unless you are an ecological activist wanting to try to link your cause with "saving cultures" or with yet another critique of the West+books
Sidetracked Home Executives:From Pigpen to Paradise+P+I bought this book in 1981 and lent it to my sister-in-law who promptly lost it.  When my daughter asked me for help to organize her housekeeping,I looked for this book. I like this book because it is an easy organized system that kept me on track with daily,weekly,monthly,and yearly tasks+books
Cross-wise+P+Alex Cross is back, and this time he's after The Butcher, the man who killed Alex's wife some ten years ago and has been raping and killing ever since. This character, The Butcher, is one of the more colorful in Cross' bag of collared criminals, and much of the book is spent in The Butcher's POV, which adds texture and depth to this novel. Alex and his near-constant depression can be boring at times, when he's fretting over Nana's workload, how little time he spends with his kids, whether he could have done more to stop the murder of Maria, his wife, some ten years ago. But Alex gets out of his funk long enough to track down The Butcher, and this is a chase I enjoyed. Whether or not Alex will get bored in private practice and will go back to the FBI is a story line that didn't move me, so I'm hoping he decides to go back, but Patterson has another hit with CROSS, and this series just keeps going. For that, I am thankful+books
Sluggish, Uneventful, Corny and Borrrrring+N+I usually read Stephen King for his interesting ideas and imagery and expect his books to read fast and well. I've read three previous King books that have had the occasional long passages with overstated depictions of horror, doom, and grotesquery in order to immerse his readers into the tone of his story.  This one takes the cake because what is meant to read as terror and horror is really ridiculous and unimaginative. And this is exactly what "Insomnia" is. This isn't a spoiler, just the author's note: at the end of the book we read Sep. 10, 1990- Nov 10, 1993- three years in which King took to write this book.  Three years which were evidently wasted.  The other King books I've read were engrossing for their characterizations and character identification.  "Insomnia's" Ralph Roberts is certainly a character the reader could identify with.  He is strong, kind, has traditional gentlemanly views on aiding women in distress and regards them as beautiful and respectable. His counterpart Lois Chasse doesn't come across as identifiable. Instead she serves as a  secondary character who has no real flair or identity other than being in love with Ralph. King doesn't usually do that with his secondary characters.  Other characters with much smaller roles in this book come across as real and identifiable, like Ed and Helen Deepenau, the three bald doctors, and Ralph's numerous confidantes.  Then there's the whole abortion mess. This central political issue crumbles midway thru and seems to serve no purpose at all in the story. Though King does provide an interesting and seemingly objective commentary on the issue via Detective Leydecker (albeit with a tranparently pro-choice slant), it serves no relevance to the theme of the story but just hangs there on display used for no more than a story device.    I gave the book two stars because I am an inspiring writer and reading this provided me with some of the devices that are important to utilize as part of a writer's arsenal. The devices were obvious and all thru the reading I asked myself, 'How is King going to get through this?' His weapon of choice was most often Ralph Robert's narration (via third person) that analyzed the events of the story and interpreted its meaning and significance. It seemed whenever King was in trouble in the story, he would use Ralph as his solution and let him think it out and guide it for him. This is a useful tool for a beginning writer, but King used it as a crutch to tell a story that had no pulse from the beginning.  One last thing, the villians just don't work. They are not frightening, they are not demonic, they are not vicious or malign. Three little bald doctors with scalpels and scissors? Their defining characteristics are being small and bald- does that really frighten anyone? The real villian among them dances around and jump ropes to reveal his evil madness. Then there's the Crimson King, the evil supernatural mastermind we read about from page 100 who finally enters the story on page 550 as a Catfish in one of the most terrible, anti-climactic scenes ever rendered.  I rest my case.              +books
Double standard when writing about race+N+As a white man, this book offended me several times during the first five minutes of reading it.  If an author wrote in the same way about black people the book would not even be published! I am tired of the double standard! Thank god I didn't pay for this book and only checked it out at the library+books
Boring+N+Big disappointment.  I expected this book to be hysterical.  Her sense of humor is certainly different!  Very shallow material. Marty Wurtz Author of Deceptions and Betrayal+books
Excellent book!!+P+I think this is really an excellent book, one that I would highly recommend.  Everyone should read this and realize the words of wisdom by Dr. Fuhrman.  I have changed my diet radically because of what he has written.  A real wake up call for me!  The diet is easy to follow and one that will revitalize and energize anyone that follows it!  A great read!+books

Why continue to be deceived...+N+Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, "The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea," provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: "The REAL Rapture".  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's "The REAL Rapture" (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site, prophecyhouse dot com, for details on these items)+books
Connecting the Dots+P+I read this book in record time.  Greg Palast took all the pieces of the jigsaw over the last few decades and put them together in a succinctly written way to make me see in a new light this 'government'.  I am ashamed that our own US media is no longer emboldened to fight this hypocrisy we call a government.  From Iran to Iran Contra to Iraq and the Oil fields, from the Halliburtons and all the cronys names who have been hiding for so many years doing so much harm.  Thanks for opening my eyes and giveing me a new insite into how easily our democracy can be turned without the participation of ALL the people.  AND HOW IMPORTANT FREEDOM OF THE PRESS AND THE FOURTH ESTATE is to your Democracy+books
Not Worth the 25-Cent Cost+N+When I found "Hour Game" in paperback at our local library's monthly book sale, I thought I had hit pay dirt.  But I cannot believe that this author who wrote such gripping gems such as "The Winner" and "Absolute Power" could turn out such a dog.  Long, boring, and confusing.  I fear that Mr. Baldacci hired an "aspiring young writer" to "help" him crank out a quick book. I cannot pass this book along to my friends -- I couldn't do that to them.  It will be tossed into our blue recycle bin.  What a waste.  What a shame.+books
I feel dirty now+N+This book is about a writer who splits up with his long-term boyfriend, becomes depressed, and then becomes friends with a young boy (I think 10? 12? I don't remember) over the phone who was abused and used in a kiddy porn ring by his parents before escaping only to learn he had AIDs and writing a book on it. Except as the book goes on, it becomes questionable whether the kid actually exists.  All well and good, but what really makes the book stand out isn't the storyline. Noooo. It's the slashy overtones where there REALLY REALLY SQUICKILY SHOULDN'T BE ANY! I should NOT get the idea that this abused kid is this middle-aged author's fantasy. No, no, NO.  I felt dirty after reading this. I felt even more dirty after finding out via wikipedia that the author based it on a real life experience of it.  This is a scary scary man, and makes me want a long long bath.+books
Why should people not listen to both sides of the story? +N+=== quote   Pay no attention to the negative criticisms by those who are obviously Moonies. This is should be required reading. Nansook Hong had the courage to endure and to finally escape the clutches of this dangerous cult led by the Korean flake who thinks he's God.  === end   Funny, so people should not listen to the story of those who are still within the UM, why is this?   Also Rev. Moon himself doesn't claim to be God, this is always said by others, Rev.Moon stresses the point without God he would be nothing...+books
This is funny?+N+Ok, granted, there ARE a FEW things in here that deserve a chuckle, but for the most part, this stuff is pure drivel.  Definitely not a &quot;sit-down-and-read-it-all-in-one-go&quot; book, but even when broken up into small chunks, you'll spend forever and a day looking for something that's truly funny+books
The best general book out there for WDW+P+My family of five (kids presently aged 9,7,3 yrs) has been to Walt Disney World before.   We love the place and very much look forward to our trips there.   However, experience has taught me that a good guide book is STILL a valuable tool  when traveling to Disney, and well worth the money for the knowledge and tips you gain.   I've bought _The OFFICIAL Guide to WDW_ (not worth the $ in my opinion),  Passporter's (also good), Birnbaum's, etc. but this is still the best-- especially if you are in the planning stages of  your trip. If you have small kids, I'd recommend getting the smaller, more portable  [...+books
A total disappointment and very depressing+N+I've always been a huge fan of Nicholas Sparks, and I couldn't wait to read Dear John. Well, there was no reason to rush. It starts out okay, but then just gets more and more depressing. The main girl character is annoying and you hope that John will find someone who deserves him, instead of just pouting over her for most the book.  I cannot wait for another Nicholas Sparks book, but only because I want to know that he hasn't lost his touch, and that this novel was just a fluck+books
Not worth the money+N+I'm a huge Alton Brown fan. This is one of the books I asked for when my birthday came around. I thought I wanted it after reading the reviews and thought it sounded good. I was very disappointed. While there is some good information in it, it's mostly blank pages that you write your own recipes in w/ your notes. There are a few clear plastic pages so that you can put in recipe clippings and instructions and warranties for various kitchen gadgets, but a simple file folder would solve that. Sadly, I will be returning this book and finding something else to purchase+books
Kudos for Photoshop CS2 Bible+P+You won't be disappointed if you purchase this great reference!  Not only did the book impress me, but so did the help that I received from Laurie Ulrich Fuller, one of the authors. When I had a couple of questions, I sent her an email. Usually one has to wait for quite a while to receive a reply if they even do receive a reply. With Laurie I received a reply in less than 24 hours! She was friendly and didn't seem to mind answering my questions. How wonderful it is to find someone willing to help you. No matter how good a book is, it really makes a book outstanding when you can get responses to any questions that that may come up. It keeps one from feeling frustrated.  I rate the book TOPS+books
This book has a special place in my heart+N+This is one of those rare treats in the literary world that grab your attention, keep you enthralled, and refuse to let you stop reading.  I read this book and literally did not sleep one night because I was too busy trying to finish the book.  But what makes this book so rare is not because of how good it is, but it's because how good everything is until the very end.  That's right, the incredible cop-out of an ending made me mad enough to hate the entire novel.  This is "deus ex machina" in its finest form.  This is unexcusable in my opinion.  I just don't get it.  I just don't understand how one can (seemingly) work so hard on a work of fiction only to screw everyone in the final pages.  I gave it two stars (as opposed to one) for fooling everyone into reading through this book.  This is by far and away my most dissappointing reading ever+books
Don't!+N+Possibly the worst book I have ever read.  The "style" could be bested by a not-too-bright fifth grader.  The plot is an imbecilic rehash of the Divinci Code.  Don't bother keeping track of any details, because everything turns out to be irrelevant.  If you want to entertain yourself and your friends, however, check this out of your local library and get mildly drunk.  Now open the book at random and read aloud.  This should cause hysterical I-can't-believe-this-got-published laughter. +books
Great insight into what I thought was "good for me"+P+Although my trips to fast-food joints have only been reduced (not eliminated), I've found myself referring to fast-food beverages as "Drinking Corn"....you'll need to read the book to find out why.  I recommend this book if you're at all curious about the food you eat.  It was great that the auther was able to give both sides of the story for each of the 4 meals and I've certainly been taking a closer look at where my food comes from+books
So sad that Women can't seem to "live" without men in this novel!!!+N+There was such promise, a woman who had "escaped" her ho-hum marriage, gone back to her roots was finding herself, starting her art work back up, caring for her mysteriously crazy mother, and then she "had" to fall for a monk, and turned this story into a romance novel.  When she "married" herself with knots into the sea, and lovingly talked about mermaids, it had some hope of independence, then it failed, going back to her husband after the "affair" (she got dumped for God.)  She didn't go back stronger, she went back wimpier and needy.  Sure, she had art in a gallery, but whee....where was her growth??  There wasn't any.  Sorry.  This novel leaves the reader disappointed and sad.  Ugh!+books
Moves far too slowly+N+This book is about a man named Ray Atlee whose father has just died, leaving $3 million in unexplained cash.  Someone else knows about the money.  The three major questions for the book to answer are:  1) Where did the money come from? 2) Who is the mystery person (or people) trying to get it? 3) What will Ray do with it?  I have reached page 261 in this book, and NONE of these questions have been answered.  Ray has moved the money around, been vaguely threatened by person or persons unknown and had many conversations with side characters that all led nowhere.  261 pages in, all I know is where the money DIDN'T come from.  This is a legal thriller that does not thrill.  The pacing is deadly dull and I keep waiting, waiting, WAITING for something to happen and nothing does.  Finally I threw the book down in frustration an hour or so ago when I realized how close to 300 pages I'd gotten with nothing happening.  I don't know why I even gave the book this much of a chance.  Nothing bad has happened to him, and even though three million is at stake, none of the bad guys have taken any but the most harmless ways of trying to get it.  If they were really following him as much as it's alluded to in the book, they could have easily put a bullet in his head any time and taken the cash.  He spends half the book carrying it around in the trunk of his car, for God's sake!  I may finish it one day, but as of now I just don't care about the money or the characters who are after it.  Not Grisham's best, by a long shot+books
Thin characterization+N+I agree with one the comments posted below. The main problem with this book is Mitch is a totally one-dimensional character and it's impossible to find any depth in him. Over the course of the book he doesn't change, he's unsympathetic, and by the time we've reached page 500, we don't know anything more about him than we did on page 10. I found myself dying to get to the end of this book, just so I could start another book with some substance and some well-drawn characters.  Another major problem is that most of the characters in this book use the same wise-cracking speaking style so there is no sense of the characters being different from each other in any way.  Overall, I thought this was mediocre and a bit of a waste of time+books
Expand your cultural horizons with this easy to read gem+P+There is a profound need for Americans to read books about non-Western cultures. This is especially true for those in political leadership positions. Things Fall Apart, by Chinua Achebe, is one such book.  I learned about Things Fall Apart for the first time recently on somebody's blog. I picked it up from the library two days ago and finished it today.  Things Fall Apart is the story of Okonkwo, a leader in the village of Umuofia in Nigeria. The story is told from the point of view that the Ibo culture of Okonkwo's people. This culture is profoundly different from that of 21st Century America. A significant part of this book is spent establishing the culture and society for the reader.  In the first part of the book, the cultural constructs hold the society together, even though things fall apart on occasion on a personal level for Okonkwo and others in the book. But things fall apart for the culture as a whole as a result of the arrival of Christian missionaries and British colonial rulers. The story of how this happens to Okonkwo and his village is told in a simple, accessible, but gripping way.  If you read this book, do NOT use the speed reading technique of reading the end first. Just read it through, and will find that the very last paragraph provides the exclamation point that makes this book's message so important+books
the worst of them all+N+Huge disappointment. Trace wasn't that good either. Having read all Scarpetta's previous storiesbut I was hoping Trace would be only bad one. However, the downhill trend seems to continue. These two books are not the usual intelligent plots Cornwell is capable of writing. Save your money, don't buy it. I completely agree with all the reviews posted so far, so I won't go into the plot -or rather lack of a real plot -details+books
VERY ENJOYABLE+P+I love Doris Kearns Goodwin's work, and this book is no exception. It's very different from her other books, but very enjoyable.  It brought me back to my childhood while reading about hers.    Very short in comparison to her other books, but worth the time and the money.  I have heard complaints that she got some of the baseball facts wrong, but I am not a baseball historian, so this didn't bother me in the least bit. +books
just the tip of the iceberg+N+In order to maintain the legal status of your corporation, you need to pass very specific resolutions and keep very specific records.  I had hoped for a "cookbook" for the legal steps required to set up and operate my corporation, but this is not it.    The info on corporate structures is very basic and general - you could easily find this level of detail on the web.  That's my primary complaint with this book...  it mentions what you must do, but doesn't give you the specifics of how.  Instead of this book, I recommend you:  (1)  Get the *basics* from your lawyer or accountant (or even doing some research on the web)  (2)  buy The Corporate Minutes Book by Anothony Mancuso instead of this book+books
Another disappointing job search book+N+I have long been hoping to find the ONE career book that will point me in the write direction of finding the career that I want out of life.  I'm coming to believe that these books are mostly a waste of money.  This book contains a personality test that is not unlike any other career assessment test that you can take online, for FREE.  It then contains a boat load of charts...50 highest paying jobs for this personality type....50 jobs for this personality type with the highest amount of women/men employed...ect ect.  If this sort of thing interests you then by all means this book might be for you.  Most of the book however is a list of different jobs for the different personality types that contains descriptions, experience/education needed, related job, ect but it is all on a VERY BASIC level.  Save your money and speak with a career counsler+books
Terrible+N+This is easily one of the worst written, worst researched, and worst argued books I have ever read.  In fact it is so bad it is laughable.  I do not agree with their views but this has nothing to do with this review.  Turn to the epilogue and read this statement: "For example, all prophecy scholars agree that the generation that saw Israel restored to her land in 1948 could well be the "generation [that] will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened" (Matthew 24:32-34, NIV)."  No one, not even LaHaye can actually believe that statement.  You can't get 10 people to agree on what to have for lunch, how in the world will you ever get people to agree on something as controversial as the interpretation of Bible prophecy.  Other things that had me in stitches was when they said that a past scholar believed there would be 50 years between the rapture and the tribulation.  They then go on to state that they are pretty sure he would change his mind if he were alive today.  That may be true but why even bring it up.  If that makes it in your book you surely must not have much to say.  Don't waste your time, money, or effort on this book.  I had never read any Left Behind or other LaHaye prophecy books.  From the outside in it sure seemed like it was a cash cow with little substance.  This absolutely proved to me that my assumption is probably true.  ****A Side Note**** For those commenting on reviews by partial preterists, you really have no idea what you are talking about.  I understand the futurist view.  I was taught it my whole life and in Bible college.  I have read books about it including this piece of drivel.  The least you can do is read something by DeMar or Gentry and learn what you are arguing against instead of making assumptions.  What has been written so far in the reviews really makes you look like you have no idea what you are talking about+books
Absurd+N+James Glassman should apologize for his stupidity, his arrogance, and this book, which lured in a whole lot of amateur investors just as the stock market was about to go bust. +books
Welcome back, Ms. Plum+P+After the letdown of the previous book in this series, it is nice to see Stephanie Plum back at her real occupation, ace bounty hunter.  Well, maybe ace is not the right term, but let it be.  The characters are fine and funny, as in the first ten books.  The gritty streets of New Jersey are not exactly scenic but they are very real.  And there is an actual plot, rather than a series of humorous sketches that wear thin when not attached to anything.  As for dialogue, that's why Janet Evanovich's fans keep coming back for more.  She has a real knack, an excellent ear for the nuances of street dialogue.  I can now rest easy for a while, knowing the writer has not run out of material.  My greatest hope is that she doesn't have a relapse in the 13th episode, that triskadecaphobia doesn't do in our heroine.  P.S.  This is the very best of the twelve books in the Plum series, and Stephanie holds the record for the most times a central figure is tasered in all of fiction+books
Excellent information+P+I'm so glad that a friend recommended this book to me.  It gave me a better understanding of what's happening to my baby at various stages in his development, which sets my mind at ease.  The book is well-written.  It is divided by ages with a general description of how a baby behaves at that particular age and an explanation of what's happening in the baby's world and how it affects the baby's mood in addition to his behavior+books
As insightful as "Real Men Don't Eat Quiche," but without the humor+N+In "Iron John," Robert Bly announces that American men are all unhappy because the pressures of civilization have caused them to lose touch with their innate maleness.  He illustrates his point with one of the Brothers Grimm's more obscure (and frankly less interesting) stories, interpreting it as an allegory that just happens to prove his point.  He also draws heavily on Freudian and Jungian theories.  He proves his point in the same way Freud and Jung proved theirs' i.e. by saying "This is what I see, I am the expert, so that makes it true, Occham's Razor be darned."  Bly offers no objective evidence to support his positions, nor does he allow room for the possibility of other interpretations or, heaven forbid, that his observations might be wrong.  For example, Bly asserts that men become unhappy around the age of 35 (conveniently neglecting to site research supporting this assertion, despite his objective tone).  Bly explains that this is because at that age men begin to realize that their childhood dreams will not come true.  He does not consider that by age 35, most men have realized that they don't really want to be firemen.  Could this alleged unhappiness possibly be due to media influences that require unhappy customers to sell products to (such as self-help books)?  Naw, it's gotta be that "dreams" thing.  Bly also describes a case where students during the Viet Nam war broke into their college presidents' office to look for proof that the college was collaborating with the CIA.  Bly states that this happened because of the mistrust in male authority figures, because their fathers left home to work, preventing their sons from seeing how men work.  Bly does not consider the possibility that the students may have been righteously angry about the war and confused by their anger.  No, there had to be a "real" reason for the break-in, and aren't we lucky to have Robert Bly to tell us what it is?  Along the way, Bly overloads his writing with literary references, all carefully interpreted to suit his purposes.  It's all very pretentious, er uh, interesting, but so what?  I could interpret the same passages to mean something else.  If I lived at the time the passages were written, my interpretation would most likely be very different, despite Bly's insistence that his ideas are timeless and universal.  Bly' obsession with literary images does more than bog his writing down, however.  It underscores what is wrong with his whole premise.  He tries to build up the notion of the tragedy of lost male identity as objective fact, but uses only subjective views (many not his own and possibly taken wildly out of context) to support the idea.  Sorry Bob, you can't have it both ways.  One gets the impression that "Iron John" was cynically written to fill a niche.  Like all self-help books, "Iron John" targets a specific audience, tells them they are not happy, and insists that only by following his directions can they truly be happy.  Bly's target audience is White men who went to college and felt left out of the various political movements.  If you do not need a political movement to define who you are, then "Iron John" is not for you+books
RmLamatt author of Fears Flutterby+N+I wish Mr. Sparks would find the voice he wrote with in his earlier novels. That flow and voice I understood so well. At First Sight felt like I was reading a deadline novel. Just words, no insight, didn't make this reader think at all. Sorry, just the way I read it.+books
Not worth the read.+N+This was the first book by Danielle Steele that I have read and it will be the last I read by her. I was truly disappointed and believe she is a highly over-rated author. The story was VERY drawn out and I caught myself dozing off a few times because the book was so boring. If you want to fall asleep quick then this is the book for yo+books
Nothing Happens+N+The synopsis on the back cover of Saturday overpromises by several light years when it alludes to Perowne's fight to "preserve the life that is dear to him."  I wasn't exactly hoping for an episode of "24," but why write a book with the single-day gimmick if nothing much happens in that day (save for a few minutes of terror)?  As noted by other reviewers, easily three-quarters of this story is Perowne ruminating and offering painfully minute details of his priviledged life.  Even when there is some tension and action, McEwan ruins it slathering the moment in maudlin narration.  I just wanted something to happen, rather than to hear any more about his squash game and fish stew.  In fact, here's my ugly little confession: By the end of this book, I was rooting for the neurologically doomed thug to off the entire insipid family, grandpa the drunken poet, junior the Clapton wannabe, the whole lot.  If McEwan decides to write "Sunday," we can only hope that the burning plane *is* full of Chechen terrorists, headed right for chez Perowne+books
Disappointing+N+Like "Jurassic Park", this book starts out promisingly but runs out of steam within just a few chapters. My reasons for such an accusation: 1. Crichton overloads the reader with scientific facts. And while these can be quite interesting, they often obstruct the action and progress of the storyline (Dan Brown, for instance, is a writer who can properly balance compelling action with factual sensitivity). As a result, the book comes off as slow and stumbling. 2. The plot isn't all that interesting to begin with. (Vengeful gorillas? Talking gorillas? Misanthropic gorillas? Come on.) 3. The book's ending is utterly terrible. 4. Cricton's writing is weak, and the characters are inconsistent and unconvincing.  Sorry, Michael, but this book just didn't do it for me+books
ME ME ME ME ME+N+Generations of sad dingbats have stood on mountains waiting for some all-important 'End Time', and when the predicted dates come and go, is anyone dissuaded?  Of course not. They just re-interpret the same old ambiguities and come up with another date. "No, really, THIS TIME we KNOW we've got it right."  Because books like this exploit the terminally self-centred, who want it all to be about 'ME'.  "I" will be there when it all happens. It's all for "MY" generation. It's all focused on "ME".  LaHaye and Jenkins  clearly capitalise on these feelings, as have generations before them.  Nobody ever went broke overestimating the gullibility of the human race+books
An interesting, but dishonest and discouraging book+N+&#65279;In the end, it appears that by "anti-Catholic prejudice", Jenkins means a failure to regard what he considers to be the core of the Roman Catholic church with sufficient reverence.   He would probably characterize most of the practicing Catholics I know as near-heretical.  Jenkins uses related but distinct words like "bigotry" and "prejudice" interchangeably. It is clear by the end that a great deal of what he is terming "prejudice", which is usually applied to hostility from outsiders, is in fact internal dissent and dissatisfaction from current and former Catholics.  I refuse to be embarrassed on behalf of my society at large if the hierarchy of any organization is having problems keeping the flock in line.  The book is quite interesting, containing a vast amount of information, including a lot which seems to argue against Jenkin's point.  I don't know whether to congratulate him to have the honesty to include it or to suppose that he has completely failed to understand how others might see it.  Jenkins is attempting to gain momentum from the various "liberation" movements that have arisen in the wake of the Civil Rights movement that became prominent in the 1950s.   To this end, he employs the tried and true propaganda technique of beginning history at a point where one's own side can be made to look like an injured innocent, i.e., the anti-Catholicism of nativists and Know-Nothings.  If he really wants to trace the history of Protestant/Catholic conflict, he needs to go back to the Reformation at least.  It would also be appropriate to mention the Vatican's anti-Americanism during the same period; many churches were offended that Americans considered the people, rather than God,to be the legitimate source of political power.   In any case, it is irrelevant, since the book largely ignores the unfortunately still extant strains of real anti-Catholic prejudice, such as the fundamentalist Protestant groups who regard the Pope as the anti-Christ. Jenkins's real foe is people whose argument with the Catholic Church is not really religious but social.  Representatives of the Church have often argued that it is their duty to enter into debates of public legislation and morality and I can't disapprove of the participation of any citizen in public debates.   They all enter at the same level, however, and those who participate in the brawl of public debate (excuse me, the marketplace of ideas) must expect sometimes very harsh criticism, although I shall always hope, often in vain, for a level of civility and honest consideration of differing viewpoints.  Jenkins feels that the Church should be accorded special reverence by all; he seems to suggest that any criticism borders on bigotry.  The Church should be permitted to make strongly worded pronouncements without risking strongly worded retorts.   To Jenkins, any dispute between the Church and any other group, including dissenting Catholics, is proof of anti-Catholic prejudice.  He would probably deny this and attempts at several points to explain the difference between prejudice/bigotry and acceptable dissent, but the main difference seems to be that acceptable dissent is removed in time and place.  Jenkins mentions that the Masons were originally welcoming to Catholics, but after what he admits to be a campaign of slander and libel by the Church hierarchs, became decidely less friendly.  Jenkins blames the Masons for the ill-will, even though he admits that the Church threw the first rhetorical punch.   In many ways, Jenkins does as much as any "No-Nothing" to argue that "real" Catholics are unable to live in a secular, multireligious society.  It is in his discussion of homosexual issues that this becomes most clear.   I share Jenkins' outrage at the invasion of St. Patrick's Cathedral by Act-Up, but for the most part he discusses the incident as if the police refused their assistance and society at large applauded; he does eventually admit that even many gay activists were appalled.  I have enough sympathy for the points that Jenkins raises about the problems of expecting rapid change with regard to a long-standing and widespread condemnation of homosexually that I would expect to be charged with homophobia.  As an outsider, I would not presume to tell the Church how to regard homosexuality or insist that they sanctify gay marriages.   At the same time, if the church is going to condemn gays as hell-bound and attempt to frustrate their efforts to reach an accomodation with the larger society, it is ridiculous for him to take umbrage at non-violent complaints.     Jenkins completely misses the point in his discussion on pedophilia.   The issue for most people is less that some priests are pedophiles than the apparent inability of the Church to deal with the issue.  People being what they are, this has presumably been an organizational problem for more than 1500 years, yet the Church seems baffled.   Some people do see this as an opportunity to beat the Church and its policy of celibacy over the head, but in fact civil authorities have in the past tried to spare the Church embarrassment by declining to prosecute and trusting the Church to deal with erring priests.   Jenkins ignores this and complains that the organizational strength of the church makes it a tempting target for grandstanding prosecutors, forgetting that this is the very reason that the problems were concealed for so long.  The Church is paying more for its own failure to deal with the problem than for the individual transgressions of certain priests+books
A Bit Disappointed+N+I have read several of Nicholas Sparks' books, but this one was different for me.  It was a very very slow start.  I was more than 150 pages into it before I got interested in the plot.  I had even considered quitting reading it at times.  It ended up being an okay story, but nothing that I couldn't have lived without reading.  What I did enjoy is the way Mr. Sparks writes about male characters in the romantic way women wish men really were.  I would suggest another read from Mr. Sparks like "The Notebook" or "The Wedding" if you want a good romantic read. +books
Definitely NOT just for children!+P+This is one of the most beautiful pop-up books I have ever seen.  As an adult without children, I have to say I would not want them handling it, as the work is so intricate and fragile.  I wouldn't give this book to a child under 12 or so.  That said, this book is truly a delight and a wonder and well worth owning.  I don't know how the authors do it but they're amazing!  Don't hesitate to buy it...just keep it away from your two-year-old.  R-r-r-i-i-i-p!!+books
Increasing rhetorical power that saved the Union and freed the slaves+P+Professor Briggs provides a fresh analysis of Lincoln's speeches -- a subject that is always a joy to study.  Abraham Lincoln had a life-long compulsion to improve his persuasive abilities.  He was constantly studying, constantly seeking a simple eloquence that could persuade ordinary people to adopt great ideas.  Dr. Briggs ably unpacks Lincoln's speeches, showing Lincoln's increasing rhetorical skill.  Professor Briggs also shows how the substance of Lincoln's ideas improved over time, due no doubt to his same addiction to self-improvement.  Lincoln wrestled with many great issues of his day, including national expansion, economic development, the railroads and the Mexican War.  Finally he grappled with slavery, the immense moral dilemma that the Founders, the Federalists and the Whigs had been unable to solve.    The Civil War drew upon all the rhetorical skills Lincoln had developed.  His oratory infused the north with moral purpose, a determination that ultimately saved the Union and freed the slaves.  A lifetime of intellectual, moral and rhetorical improvement broke the back of slavery, giving a priceless gift to the nation he loved.  Briggs' study illustrates all this remarkably well+books
Not what expected at all+N+I bought this book as a gift for a friend based on the great categories it has to offer for recording book information. I was so disappointed to find that the spaces allowed for writing are so small. Also, the book is hard to navigate. The hard cover and hard binding don't allow for anyone to write it in it (inflexible). I gave it as a gift still, but I had to apologize for what a cruddy book it was+books
Good autobiography but bad investing book+N+This book is more about his autobiography, and albiet amusing at times, isn't a real investing book. His other one: Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World is much better+books
An Intellectually Stimulating Treatise on African American Men and Their Auras+P+Scott Poulson-Bryant is a bright young artist with heady credentials and a true gift for creative thinking and well-crafted writing skills.  He joins the growing ranks of young African American strong writers such as E.L. Ayala, E. Lynn Harris, Keith Boykin, J.L. King, Caesar Brunswick, Christopher David, and Stanley Bennett Clay who not only address issues heretofore considered taboo in the Black community, but succeed not only as brave new voices but also as gifted, important writers.  HUNG: A MEDITATION ON THE MEASURE OF BLACK MEN IN AMERICA starts out with a terrific cover, promises revelation of secrets everyone wants to know, addresses his reader with pertinent facts, and then progresses to relax and offer a rather personalized memoir of his experiences as a black man in America, a man who knows the myths and the realities about phallic secrets, and shares his own insights as well as those of gentlemanly unnamed confidents from whom he gathers his facts.  Along the way Poulson-Bryant not only discusses phallus size, but he also explores the mystique of black men who model for books (Mapplethorpe is a frequent reference point), the porn industry, the world of athletes (yes, naming names), the rap world, and the executive world.  But he doesn't limit his meditation to experiences interviewing men: Poulson-Bryant wisely includes women in his foray of questioning the importance of size as a feature of desirability vs. myth vs. disadvantage.  It is a well-rounded book and one that never lets the interest lag.  But what one comes away with from this book is an appreciation of the exceptional style of writing of Scott Poulson-Bryant.  He is a writer of charm, of humor, of wit, and of intelligence.  This reader would like to see how he performs in the field of fiction: in reportage he is up there with the best!  Grady Harp, October 06+books
It doesn't get any more predictable than this...+N+The concept of this book could've worked, but Sparks didn't develop any other characters to throw the reader off track. It's painfully obvious who is driving the car. The dialogue between Miles and Sarah when they are first getting to know each other is extremely annoying, as is their relationship. Interesting how she breezes into their family and is accepted by Jonah with open arms. And the ending to the story is laughable. I won't give it away, but I'm sure you can figure it out within the first 10 pages. I doubt I can read another Sparks novel again.+books
Introspective and longwinded view on suburban male angst...+N+I've been focusing on some prizewinning books as of late, and I thought this would be a necessary prelude to reading Ford's Pulitzer Prize winnning "Independence Day". Ford has insights into what suburban life is and the desire for comfort and mystery in protagonist Frank's life. Frank's struggle to wrestle with the loss of his son and his marriage presents an opportunity to peer inside his mind and see what makes it tick. What you think of this book will depend on what you think of Frank as a narrator. His desire to evade deeper meaning and personal responsibility was maddening to me at times; others will find this a profound truth in the book. I also found him to be longwinded and I had a hard time rooting for and identifying with him as a character.  Slogged through this book and at the end, I don't think it was worth it for me.   2 star+books
Sadly disappointed+N+"The Other Boleyn Girl" and "The Queen's Fool" are two of the best books I've ever read--and I've read a LOT of books, especially about this period, which especially fascinates me. They were gripping to the end, and my involvement with the characters was complete--true masterpieces. So whenever a new book by Philippa Gregory comes out, I buy it, hoping to have the same experience, and lately have been sorely disappointed. "The Virgin's Lover" fell flat, and now I am trying to read this book but not finding myself engaged, must give it up. One reviewer suggested the books were being written too quickly--that is always an easy guess, however it depends on the writer. Anthony Trollope, for instance, was able to turn out amazing book after amazing book with incredible speed. That may or may not be the case with Gregory. I know, as a writer myself, that there are times when the work flows out, feeling almost as if it's channeled from another source, and times when it's harder, more mechanical. The more challenging situations are those when I'm not entirely convinced or in love with my subject. So to me, neither of these books feels as if they spring from a natural impulse. They feel forced, constructed. I'm going back to Trollope+books
I completely agree+N+I completely agree, which is why tomorrow, I suggest every african-american basketball player leave their 40,000,000 contracts behind and exit the game....you know, to make a statement.

Loved the book, hated the reading+N+This review refers to the Audio-book. I'm a huge James Lee Burke fan, but I found the reading of this book to be unbearable. I have listened to Mark Hammer read before and have enjoyed his renditions of other authors like Elmore Leonard, but here he just sounds tired, sloppy and unconvincing as a Cajun reader. His performance is unidimensional and lacks any variety. When he attempts to mimic a southern accent it sounds like someone from Detroit imitating Gomer Pyle. Towards the end of the reading, it sounded like he needed to clear his throat. If you want to hear a stellar reading, try another James Lee Burke work "Purple Cane Road" read by Will Patton. +books
Not Worth the 25-Cent Cost+N+When I found "Hour Game" in paperback at our local library's monthly book sale, I thought I had hit pay dirt.  But I cannot believe that this author who wrote such gripping gems such as "The Winner" and "Absolute Power" could turn out such a dog.  Long, boring, and confusing.  I fear that Mr. Baldacci hired an "aspiring young writer" to "help" him crank out a quick book. I cannot pass this book along to my friends -- I couldn't do that to them.  It will be tossed into our blue recycle bin.  What a waste.  What a shame.+books
literary masturbation+N+I picked up a copy of this pretentious garbage at a library used book sale. I paid one american buck for it, which was about 100 cents too much.  It's obvious from the start that Rush is extremely impressed with his massive vocabulary. Probably giggled himself to sleep each night after he finished his writings, imagining all the ignorant folks who would need the same dictionary he used to write it, in order to decipher his blather. I would recommend any of John Steinbeck's novels to any human who plowed his or her way through this dire drivel, simply to clean their mental palate. Dumpster fodder.+books
worthless+N+I had great hope -- sleep !!!!!!    But it is just yet another book advocating abuse of the child for the ease of the parent.  Yes, I want sleep.  NO I will not sacfice my baby's secure attachment to me, and faith in me and the world to get it.  crying it out is abuse pure and simply.  Don't waest your time and money -- if you think this is how to raise a child, do yourfelf and the child a favor and giv the child to someone who will care. +books
Your choice.+P+Nature's way.   Two of the most powerful words in the English language. And yet we believe it is completely unnatural to relinquish our "three-squares-a-day" mentality. After all, what could be more natural than eating? Problem is ... we are digging our graves ... with our teeth.   If nature's way is powerful, then transformation is even more powerful. If you are ill, if your cholesterol is high, if you are atherosclerotic or hypertensive, if you have diabetes, if you have an autoimmune disorder, could there be a chance that you've developed the foregoing condition(s) one bite at a time? Could there be a chance that you've eaten your way to disease? If so, Dr. Fuhrman's claims of recapturing and restoring ones health are valid.   This isn't quack medicine.   To wit, he cites hundreds of scientific studies which he, himself, collated in his "Chapter Notes."    I must admit I was skeptical upon reading this book. After all, how can we improve our health by cutting off our own fuel supply I reasoned? Upon initiating a gentle refeeding program at the end of a seven-day fast, I found that I had more energy than ever before.   I also made a self-discovery during the fast: I had a sinister food addiction. Sinister, because this addiction was unbeknownst to me until I started to fast. I discovered that throughout my adult life, I had simply been eating when I did not need to eat.   Life-threatening diseases do not always shout at us with warning signs. They rather whisper. Toxins in the body do not always announce their presence. I have always questioned the misnomer of "sudden death." Is a death really sudden if it represents the culmination of self abuse and a behaviorally-driven, ongoing toxic lifestyle?    Don't we give greater precedence to cleaning our cars, than we do to cleaning the machinations of our own bodies? Do we honestly believe that a protein-rich, sugar-saturated, fat-based diet is helping us?   Look around you. Obesity is ubiquitous. Perhaps you, yourself, are overweight or obese, or wallowing in a seemingly endless downward spiral of disease and debilitation. There is hope. You can indeed, as Dr. Fuhrman claims, recoup good health. Not only can you function with a few relatively simple modifications, you can also flourish. Conversely, you can, as they say, "continue to do what you've always done, and you will deserve to get what you've always got."  For the price of six Big Macs, you can do a "180" by simply investing in this book. This book will CHANGE YOUR LIFE ... forever.  Sorry I am indeed to only award it five stars when it deserves a galaxy+books
Readalbe but junky+N+Timeline is equivalent to a 99 cent taco. It's an indulgent bit of junk food. Timeline starts with a Hillerman-esque scientist turning up in the middle of New Mexico - an intriguing idea, but goes to the land of mediocracy right after that filled with cartoon characters. There are so many preposterous story elements that it's just really difficult to take seriously. The story is ever-predictable and ludicrous. But, a 99 cent taco is worth the effort if you're real hungry. Go back and read Andromeda Strain.+books

A depressing story about miserable people living in a desolate place.  +N+After reading "The Kite Runner" - a deeply involving and heart wrenching story of friendship, loyalty and forgiveness amidst the backdrop of life in Afghanistan during the Russian war and the Taliban rule, I set out expecting more of the same from the Swallows of Kabul.  The latter was quite disapointing.    The Swallows of Kabul focusses on 4 main characters struggling to maintain their dignity and humanity amidst the violence, cruelty and desolation of their surroundings.  The dismal context of this story is properly set up.  Enough time is spent in illustrating the violence and suppression of human rights by the Taliban and the desperation of the Afghan people is clearly communicated. Unfortunately, the novel reads like a short story.  Proper character development is not established, so the reader ends up having little or no sympathy for its key characters who want for more redeeming traits.    The novel is successful in  painting a truly depressing picture of Afghanistan, making us thank our lucky stars for being far removed from such a place.  But if you're looking for an inspiring tale of how the human spirit triumphs over such dismal circumstances, then I wouldn't recommend this book for you.  I was glad to have turned the last page and put this book down+books
On This Earth: Photographs from East Africa review+P+This is an incredable book. The images are amazing and it's fun to look at. I highly recomend it to people who are starting out in photography and are looking for some example artists already in the field+books
Best book I've ever read!+P+This book has no doubt been the best book I've ever read.  I credit this book with saving my marriage.  My husband and I had filed for divorce (all we had to do was sign the bottom line) and decided to give it one last chance.  My mother sent us to a marriage conference featuring Dr. Chapman and his book.  After the conference, I just had to buy the book and I read it through almost non-stop.  The principles found in this book are not just applicable to marriage but carry over into every other relationship in your life.  Awesome! +books
Mediocre Maron+N+This is not one of the better entries to this series. After successfully balancing an intriguing mystery with an important wedding in "Rituals of the Season" it is disappointing to have this story be such a mismash. In this book, readers are finally introduced to Dwight's ex-wife and his son, Cal, but there is no development of either as characters. This is such a strong point to Maron's writing--evocative descriptions of people and places--that it disconcerting to put down this book and not feel like I have just been on a trip to North Carolina (or Virginia.) The characters are flat and unlikeable, the "mystery(s)" are odd and the plot just isn't there.  Still, any Margaret Maron/Deborah Knot mystery is better than none, and the actions in this story will have an impact on Deborah and Dwight's future, but don't read this expecting a thrilling or clever mystery; read it as a segue to the next book in the series+books
Misery in St. Tropez+N+Cannot remember a reading a worse book.  Boring, uninteresting story, repetitive dialogue.  The only good think about it is that it is very short+books
relatively useless+N+This book is basically a compilation of different things, most of them pretty useless. In particular, all the mathematical part is in view of the recent developments of network theory, totally obsolete. It seems a better investment to buy a network theory book or a "real" sociology book+books
Book content is excellent, but paper quality is worst ever+P+I am reading the fifth edition of this book. In the earlier editions the book was published in three or four volumes. The fifth edition  is a combination of all volumes. So that is good.  The book is a dense read. But the content is excellent. There are 163 chapters in this book. Each chapter written by different authors - experts in respective areas. So the book provides a best of breed treatment to various assorted topics. However, not all chapters are good (but most are). I'd say about 20 or so are of filler kind of chapters. Nothing really special in them. But the book is worth for the rest of the matter.   The chapters are also written to provoke further thought into each area. Kind of "first principles" approach - which I like compared to the CISSP guide approach of "here is the information, now devour it for the exam". However this book is not an exam guide (and I knew that before hand). I bought this book for the matter in it and I am very satisfied.   If you are the kind of person who want to quickly assimilate and regurgitate the matter for CISSP, then dont even bother. I am kind of person who loves to read things from the basics slowly, getting the concepts and ideas all clear in my mind and hence I plan to finish this book before reading CISSP exam guide (which by the way is also sitting on my bookshelf).  However I have a major complaint againg the publishers. Having charged One hundred thirty dollars for a 2000 page book, I'd expect the quality of paper is decent. The paper is so thin, I invariably turn two pages when I am thiking it is one page. It is so thin, even turning the page carefully damages the paper. I agree that the content is specialized and most authors hold at least two or more certifications (CISSP, CISA, SSCP etc.), but that does not warrant printing the book on really wafer thin transparent paper. Sure, the publishers need to make money, but not by compromising the quality of the paper SO MUCH.  And you'd expect this kind of book to live on your shelf for a long long time than "Teach yourself crap in 24 hours" books, but the quality of paper will make that unlikely. Hence I am giving 4 stars to a book which otherwise would deserve 6 star+books
Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!+P+History has not been kind to this man. Perhaps it is because he was interpreted as being a "penny pincher" or maybe because he was a friend and admirer of Adolf Hitler. Whatever the reason, even though he was at one time the world's richest man, his triumph seems to have faded into the books. This book is one of them.  If I had to pick a favorite book written by a successful businessman, this has to be it. Does it tell you how to become a billionaire? No. What it does teach you is how to succeed, not only financially, but as a person.   It explores the creation of his own wealth, as well as valuable lessons from the construction of his vast oil empire. Also, it covers the things that are greater than wealth, such as health, charity, and personality. Towards the end, it also becomes a sort of social commentary, on man's degradation of morality and kindess, on the disappearance of art and classical music from the mainstream, and on his general dissatisfaction with similar affairs at that time.  It would be difficult to write a thorough review as to why you need to buy this book, because it is so unlike what you have read before. But take my word for it: you will be a better person for reading this book. It may not make you rich, but it will make you wealthy+books
Too Politically Correct+N+I'm glad to see I'm not the only one to notice the anti-White preaching in this book.   Not what I expected at all because this is how History is taught today and this is supposed to be an answer to that.   I was expecting to learn a lot more - most of the things mentioned I already knew.   I graduated from high school in '89 and then got a Bachelor's degree from a state college that wasn't in History.   Perhaps this book would be useful to those who have less education.  +books
The art of teaching old dogs new tricks+P+How is it that the Oakland A's have won the AL West in 2000, 2002, 2003 (and are all but assured of winning this year, 2006), as well as the wild card in 2001, even though they are in the bottom third of all major league baseball teams in total payroll?  That is the narrative that Michael Lewis uses to tell the story of his book Moneyball.  One of the central tenets of Moneyball is that there are objective statistics that although often ignored and undervalued, can, with some specificity, predict certain players' performances in certain areas.  It is, however, only half the story, and as your rotisserie league friends will no doubt tell you, old news.  The real story that Moneyball drives home is the challenge in getting people who actually make the decisions about the baseball teams to listen up.  Lewis repeatedly describes how the Old Boys Club of major league owners (who Lewis affectionately refers to as The Women's Auxiliary), players, and journalists (former Cincinnati Red and current ESPN commentator Joe Morgan is appropriately skewered) reject this statistical approach that has sometimes been referred to as sabermetrics and the teachings of sabermetricians like Billy Beane (the book's main protagonist and current A's GM), Bill James, Dick Cramer, and others.  And on the Old Boys Club the point is lost: that objective statistics have the potential to give small-market teams who cannot afford to compete financially with larger market teams for key players, the best chance of winning.  When people point to the fact that the A's have not won the World Series since 1989 in spite their almost unparalleled success over the past eight years (roughly since 1999) is when Moneyball makes its point. +books
all history is biased+P+These concerns about this historical account of Mao being biased are naive and foolish.  ALL accounts of past and present events and people are biased because that is the nature of how the controlling / ruling elite record what other members of the elite have done or are currently doing.  Very little of the truth can be widely distributed, otherwise the elite would be ousted before dawn.  This reminds me of a quote by Bush Sr. in 1992 where he says that if Americans ever knew what the Bush family had done over the years to America that they would be chased down in the streets and lynched.  Exactly.    Thus, most outlets for information (especially book publishing, and especially books used to teach history) are censored with a fine tooth comb.  In point of fact, historical accounts that are closer to the truth will always come across as bizarre, horrific, and unbelievable to all of us who have been conditioned by our "education".  For example, any book on Hitler and the Nazis that does not delve into the blatant satanism, occultism, "bull" homosexuality and fascination with the ancients (ie. Egypt, Atlantis, and others) is way off course, especially in trying to piece together what happened and why.  Of course, this constant throwing us off course is intentional and very well thought out.  Also, people like Hitler, Stalin, Mao and others are not "self-made", or randomly evil, or "in the right place at the right time" like this book claims, rather they are bred, groomed, trained, and then placed into positions of power in order to achieve specific agendas (sometimes unknown to even them).  Hard to believe?  There is one place that all of the above mentioned mass murderers can be tied to:  The Tavistock Institute of London.  Research this yourselves.  These monsters are created, and although they may be born of flesh and blood in small towns in China, Austria, Russia, Texas, Arkansas, etc., they quickly become nothing like the rest of us and do not consider themselves patriots of any nation.  So, killing us is enjoyable to them, raping and causing us misery is sport to them, and lying about it in the history books is hardly an after-thought.    Therefore, does this book go over-board with brutal details?  I would think not at all and I am sure there are many stomach retching accounts of depravity that were not told.  I have read other accounts of breeding children specifically to sacrifice and then eat (yes, I am refering to canibalism).  Sometimes, children were / are eaten alive after having been sexually violated and skinned so their terror is at an absolute peak.  This was in Mao's regime and MANY others historically. What is really going on here?! Just coincidence?    My major critique of this work is not recognizing Mao as a well made product by the hidden hands that control this planet.  He was no random peasant who cut his own swath through the masses and then appeared on the World stage at just the right time.  Human history does not unfold that way, regardless of what you may have read.+books
Obtuse and Confusing.  Don't buy this book.+N+Since I am a patent attorney specializing in computer-related inventions by trade, as well as an avid photographer, I consider myself extremely well-versed in computer technology and digital photography.  I have been using digital cameras and Photoshop for years.  Suffice it to say that I am not in any way, shape or form a "beginner."  I bought this book in order to learn advanced tips, secrets and techniques that would allow me to improve and streamline my workflow while processing my images using Photoshop CS.  However, this book is poorly written in the extreme.  It seems that almost every other sentence refers to a step, process, function or Photoshop menu item that the author fails to adequately explain, thereby leaving the reader with more questions than answers.  Every few weeks or so I keep trying to plow through another section or chapter in the hope that the descriptions and examples will get better.  But it never does.  I have yet to finish a single section of the book and think to myself, "okay, now I understand this particular concept."  Most often I am left clicking around Photoshop menus and searching for options in dialogue boxes trying in vain and with much frustration to find and use some function that the author says should be used but failed to explain or show. Most often, the author does not bother to give any examples of what he means when he says you should use some function or process buried behind 2 or 3 levels Photoshop menus.  This has turned out to be a complete waste of time and money+books
Mr. Godin Rides Again! A Triumph for those Marching to a Different Drummer!+P+From the remarkable book structuring (the "chapters" are organized in alphabetical order) to the intriguingly insightful commentary, Seth Godin has once again created a work of excellence. The book is an easy read, but at the same time leaves the mind reeling with thoughts of "Oh my, I need to fix that, or do that, or change that." I found the chapter on "Clean Fire Trucks" particularly interesting, as I had just 2 months earlier finished an innovation article on "Retiring the Fire Trucks" -- which deals with the same concept of preventing fires and not letting them start in the first place! (As such, you can then have time to clean the fire trucks, or as I put it, to retire them altogether!). His rants are compelling yet at the same time hilarious (hilarious in the sense of all the silly things we do as a people that we really shouldn't be doing). Take for example his rant on "Wrappers" and how the method of packaging both the tangible and intangible create an aura around the product that determines how the product is perceived, received, and applied. One might say, "It's the WRAPPER, stupid."  Once again, Mr. Godin has helped to "validate my existence" (despite my intense self-certainty!) by showing that the crazy, "outside the box" (hey, can we just shred the box, then burn it in effigy of the outdated strategies and the consultants who promote them?), simplifying, forward-looking, remarkable, visionary adventures we can lead our clients and companies on are really worth the effort. In short, less is more, small is big, and remarkable is just that: REMARKABLE.  This book is REMARKABLE. I strongly encourage adding it to your shelf, then spreading the virus of its contents to others.  P.S. The entire ending "Bonus Section" on blogs and other resources is something not to be missed, and single-handedly justifies the purchase+books
Ooh-la Not +N+Alicia Drake writes well, that's a given - she's a journalist. She makes all the excess of Paris during the 1970's and early 80's come very much to life. Cocaine, Heroin, Disco, Silk and Lace. But the main argument of her book, that Karl Lagerfeld and Yves Saint Laurent are both sociopaths is not that earth shattering. After all, who is she intending to enlighten by this book: Middle America? - They could care less - The fashionistas? - They already know all this stuff.  Drake doesn't seem to understand that when writing a biography the last thing you want to do is create it in a vacuum. In the end, I didn't know anything more about Lagerfeld and YSL than I did when I began this turgid ice-capade. The two enigmas remain enigmatic. Her threads are stretched beyond their breaking points through their endless repetition and as with all fashion journalism, there's a heavy air of self-hatred and revenge hanging over the whole endeavor+books

transcendant translation+P+A writer who undertakes to translate a complicated and nuanced work by an acknowledged literary master puts himself into an unenviable position, especially should the work have already been previously translated by another and be considered definitive.  And yet Heim's update on the classic Lowe-Porter translation has made Mann's Aschenbach more fully human, more tragic and less comic, still every bit as pompous and self-justifying, more insidiously real.  It's a triumph of the translator's art.  To me, anyhow, Mann's book has always been at least as much about the language, the inner self-talk of Aschenbach, as it has been about the story line or plot.  It is fascinating to see how the author enters the mind of a man who has spent his life in rigid self-denial, self-deception really, and slowly - and not without considerable struggle from his ego against it - expands his consciousness.  By book's end Aschenbach has not only found himself, he can no longer deny himself, he accepts himself as he is and then of course he dies.  The journey he undertakes - not just from serious and constricted Germany to a holiday resort on the Lido in Venice, but from stuffy and self-important man living a lie, a life of 'despites', to allowing himself to be fully conscious of one true emotion and impulse and allowing it, even willing it to take him entirely over, to free him from himself, is the thing.  Well, it's a spellbinding book, and one which rewards close rereading+books
one of best sports biographies ever+P+ranks with jerry kramer's "instant replay" as one of the most insightful books about the nfl. a time when love of the game was as important as (if not more than) the money+books
Great book about great books+P+For an avid reader like myself, it's often tough to know what to read next. In this book, Nancy Pearl helped me get quite a few suggestions.  The book is helpfully broken up into little chapters about different genres or subjects, such as Action Heroines. I found it great, because if I'm not interested in that particular subject, I can just skip to the next section.  The only thing that prevented me from giving this book 5 stars was that the summaries about the books are way too short. I really couldn't tell whether I'd like the book or not until I had come and read a few of the book's reviews on Amazon.  All in all, this is a marvelous book, chock full of great suggestions for the casual and avid reader. I recommend it wholeheartedly+books
So freakin' funny...+P+Absolutely hilarious.  I wish I could get amnesia just so I could read it again and be surprised+books
Too popular to bother trying anymore.+N+J.K. Rowling successfully put me off this book series within the first two chapters of this book.  The characters personalities were wavering in book 5, in this they completely vanished or mutated.  I'll only be getting the 7th one because it's the last one and I've read this far so I might as well go the whole way.   In books one through four the trio of Harry, Ron, and Hermione were loveable characters tenaciously and cleverly seeking out the answers to the mysteries that came up each year and saving the day.  Book 5 had them doing more angsting and screaming than mystery solving, and more whining than day saving. Book 6 made them stand in paper doll doing a bad job miming the motions the real characters would have done.  This book Harry seemed to care more about romance.  A very poorly done romance littered with cheezy phrases and romantic moments on par with the worst of bad fanfiction; which had no background or build up from previous books.  A female character from the background, whom Harry barely even notices all through the past five books, is suddenly the most perfect and beautiful girl in the school in mary-sue fashion.  Several other characters in both the foreground and background were also unfortunately treated to Rowlings amature attempts at romance, none of which bore any revelance to plot or story.  Harry also had a significant decline in morality and intelligence.  The clever boy who put clues together with his friends now cheats in one of his classes and makes one stupid mistake after another.  The image of Harry that stuck with me and seemed to glare off the pages every time he spoke or did anything was of him lying, frozen in a curled position on the floor of the train with blood coming out of his broken nose, under his invisibility cloak and rolling around with the trains motion after a particularly stupid episode with Malfoy.  As to the general plot of the book.  Poorly done.  Continually backstaged by sickeningly done romance and angst it barely made an impression on me.  Most of the 'revealations' in the book revealed nothing not already known or obvious from old information, and the culmination of what Harry was not-quite-solving didn't amount to anything.  My final opinion: Don't bother to read past book 4 if you're just starting the series and care anything at all about characterization.  A very disappointing book+books
Movie is ten times better!!+N+The time travel issue(a wierd thing about a box getting smaller) is better solved in the movie. And that thing about Lady Claire?? I can't believe that an intelligent woman could only get by in those times by literally becoming a prostitute+books
Same old stuff+N+I hate to rain on everybody's parade, but I found this book to be a rehash of stuff I've read over and over in other places. There's too many numbers in here. What people need is an attitude about money, not just &quot;save  so much money for so long at 10% interest per year and you'll have so much  saved for retirement at 65, but if you wait until you're 35 to start,  you'll only have this much saved....&quot; (that's not a quote from the  book, but you can place that quote in almost any financial book, and it  will fit just fine). Personally, I thought the Millionaire Next Door was  better and Rich Dad Poor Dad in a leauge of its own. Any book on this  subject will certainly convey &quot;some&quot; information. The problem is  that they are too number oriented. People need to focus on paying  themselves first regularly, having a set savings program and intelligent  investments. This book seems to be more focused on getting rich by  retirement. That's just great, but anybody who saves money over 40+ years  darn well better be rich by retirement or they don't know what they are  doing. On the other hand, I think the authors are realistic in the sense  that this is not get rich quick by any means. If you want to sum it all up,  no matter who you are or what your circumstances are, save money on a  regular and consistent basis, cut up ALL of your credit cards, pay cash for  everything, keep your wants and spending under control and that's about it  really. It's not that hard to get rich. I just wish the book had more  practical information and less technical analysis with all those numbers  and statistics+books
S is for Slow Read+N+Normally, I find it hard to put a Sue Grafton book down once I get started. Not the case with "S". I did not enjoy the plot about Violet and her abusive husand.  The main character Violet was too much of a stereotype - boobs, red hair, just a boozing slut over all.  I didn't get the whole thing about her brother and why he disliked her. The ending wasn't clear either. I did like the development of the relationships with the young girls exposing jealousy and how it ruined relationships over several decades. Most of the characters just weren't that interesting overall.  I missed her interactions with Rosie the restaurant owner and her neighbor, the handsome 80 year old baker Henry. Usually, there is an interesting man in the picture too - not here.  I would vote pass on this one.+books
Introspective and longwinded view on suburban male angst...+N+I've been focusing on some prizewinning books as of late, and I thought this would be a necessary prelude to reading Ford's Pulitzer Prize winnning "Independence Day". Ford has insights into what suburban life is and the desire for comfort and mystery in protagonist Frank's life. Frank's struggle to wrestle with the loss of his son and his marriage presents an opportunity to peer inside his mind and see what makes it tick. What you think of this book will depend on what you think of Frank as a narrator. His desire to evade deeper meaning and personal responsibility was maddening to me at times; others will find this a profound truth in the book. I also found him to be longwinded and I had a hard time rooting for and identifying with him as a character.  Slogged through this book and at the end, I don't think it was worth it for me.   2 star+books
These damn kids these days!+N+As someone who was certainly an undergraduate when Sacks was teaching and who has taught both high school and college, I have to say that I found the book to be quite laughable.  The entire book seems to come down to, "These damn kids today!  Boy, when I was a kid..." and resembles little more than one of Grandpa Simpson's long meandering stories.  (*Gasp!* a reference to popular culture, oh no!) Sacks never had any teaching experience nor training and was somehow suprized to learn that he was horrible at teaching.  What?   You mean to do something well you might need to learn about it and have some experience doing it???  This is, of course, ironic because Sacks was teaching classes on journalism and constantly critiques his students who ignore his journalistic experience and yet throughout the book he ignores and mocks the advice of teachers who have teaching experience.   Dear Kettle,  You are black.   Sincerely, The Pot. Throughout the book he makes constant references to kids who wear baseball hats in class, sloutch, and have piercings as if someone's appearance is indicative of their worth or ability.  I'm sure he would have a heart attack if he walked into my classroom and saw me teaching with a baseball hat on. All of his critiques would be fine if only he had done one thing: research.  He constantly compares his experiences as a teacher in the 90s with his own experiences as a student decades before.  However, all he offers is anecdotal evidence based on his own memories when comparing students then and in the 90s.  If he had taken a minute to get down off of his high horse he might have went and talked to some teachers who had been around for decades and asked them their thoughts on students, or even better, go hunt down his college professors and ask them about classes in which he was a student.  However, rather than go out and do some good investigative reporting and gather all the facts, he chose to write a poorly informed book-length letter to the editor about those damn kids who keep walking on his lawn.   This book is a missed opportunity to have a real look at students in colleges.  It is a shame that someone with no teaching experience and such an inflated self of self-importance (the very things he chastises his students for) chose to think that he was qualified to write it.+books
High IQ Idiots+P+If this book applies to the rest of the world, and all of history, then most of the evil done is not by evil men, but by highly intelligent, highly educated men who wish to possess great political power so they can do good. But, as the old saying informs us, the road to Hell is paved with good intentions. These men had good intentions, but little understanding of how to use it. Or of human nature, for that matter. Graduates of the most prestigous universities, rich, insulated from the rest of the country, they saw the populace merely as pawns to be used for their ends. Halberstam uses the word "hubris" many times, and I think his analysis is correct: the men involved (and in some cases, women) were far too interested in political power. The book is a warning to those who believe in the power of big government to effect beneficial changes; that power, unfornately, does not exist. As always, when human fantasies run up against reality, reality always wins out. Unfortunately, the people are the ones who suffer, not the politicians and other movers and shakers in government+books
Boring, boring, boring. +N+I usually don't review books I didn't finish reading or movies I didn't finish watching, but this was just way too boring to justify wasting more of my time on, even though I listened to it as an audiobook so I could do other things while "reading". I turned it off after six chapters and I'm not likely to finish it. This is my first Nora Roberts book and if they're all like this I really don't have any clue why she's so popular. I'll try one of her mystery novels before judging her, however.   Stay away from this one.+books
Wonderful!+P+From the first page to the very end, you love this crazy family and especially Rebecca.  In this sad and dysfunctional world - to be able to read this book in two days was a wonderful and warm happening!  I actually missed the family when I closed this book with tears and a smile - I love them and will keep this book to cherish with my family - always. Thank you Anne Tyler!+books
This is sick+N+I picked up this book read the reviews on the cover and was up for a funny book.  The book was anything but funny.  I read about half, up to the point where he was in a mental institution and could not read anymore. I consider myself fairly liberal but this was too over the top for me.  The graphic details of his homosexual love affair with a 33 yr. old was just sick. I am not sure where this belongs as a novel or a memoir but I had to throw it away because I did not want my children to get a hold of it.  I found the whole thing disturbing and failed to see the humor in these sick, mentally ill characters. I started hating them for the abuse they put their children through+books
Don't waste your money+N+I was tremendously disappointed in this book.  The cost of $35-50 is definitely a complete rip-off for what you get from the author.  All you need to do is refer to pages 227-246.  Those are the pages that represent the bibliography.  I actually was so pissed off after reading this book that I counted them.  In total the author referenced the words and work of 488 author people.  There are only 223 pages of text and 6 chapters in the book.  I am certain you can do the math but I'll do it for you.   There are on average more than 2 references per page and over 80 per chapter.  It's as though the author has never had an original thought of his own.  If I wanted to hire somebody to go out and look up the work of other people I would have done that.  I was expecting the author to use his own first-hand knowledge and experience in order to help educate and inform others such as myself about the process.  Instead, what I got was something a high school student would do while trying to complete a report for homework.  My only question is who is less ethical:  the author or the publishing company that let this slide through the screening process.  For all of those that gave this book 5 stars I can only guess that you don't enjoy actually reading+books
Anne Frank review+P+It was very interesting and exciting to delve into the life of a family hiding from the Nazis during WWII. I highly recommend this book and I hope I can one day go see the Anne Frank museum where the family lived during this time+books
Great and amazing Item+P+As a matter of fact, I must say my first real love was Star Wars Chronicles, first edition from 1995, Not only because of my likeness for the old Trilogy, but because of the data and images about characters, weapons, landscapes, behind-the-scenes images you can find in the great book. Now I must say, I was interested in this new book just because I read the names and credentials of the authors although my interest in this new George Lucas creation is not my favorite trilogy and I could say something about it. Then I thought, "well, maybe today's young kids will love this second trilogy more than the first one, and their hearts will bit for Darth Maul even more than for Darth Vader". If someone had to write this book, there's no other choice than these huge star wars knowledgemen, these fanfiles Yodas.  Now, Star Wars Chronicles the Prequels is a "had to be written" book and it's absolutelly amazing with its more than 3000 images about the Prequels, all those characters, all those ships, all those light sabers... all those worlds.  Now, Star Wars Chronicles, TP has won a proudly place beside my old and dusty Star Wars Chronicles. Don't you doubt it: this book is your next "need to have".  And why don't I give it a 5 Star rate? I think Chronicle Books should think a bit on Spanish translation for this wideworld phenomena book. I'm absolutely sure they will reach a really important market here.  Darth Khan+books
Scrumptous+P+I absolutely love Paula and this is the first cookbook of hers that I've bought. The book has a great layout (cakes, pies, cookies, bars, etc.) There are a few pictures (they are not on the same pages as their recipes) that make me want to bake even more! Everything in the book sounds so delicious but the thing that really got me was her pound cake. Now she has about 5 or 6 pound cake variations - I tried the cream cheese variation. Over the past 6 months I have been searching for "the" pound cake recipe and have tried a ton of different ones always with disappointment. When I tried Paula's I kept my expectations low and I was blown away!! It actually tasted like pound cake, not too sweet, not to floury--just perfect!!! I can't wait to try the rest of her recipes, for each ten I looked at I would deffinitely try at least 8 and consider the other 2! A minor disappointment is that some of her recipes call for pre-made cake mixes. Although it is great for cutting down on time I suppose, I don't see the sense in putting pre-made mixes into a cookbook. Still doesn't take away from the flavor or temptation of her desserts. Excellence+books
THE encyclopedia of esoteric teachings+P+The book is amazing in its amount of topics covered, from Gnostic beliefs, the lost city of Atlantis, who really wrote Shakespeare, who were the Rosecrucians,secret meanings of the Zodiac, alchemy, Pythagorean math, mystery schools and much,much, much, more at 56 chapters. For an introduction to every esoteric religion in history, buy this book.I read it from cover to cover and it was enthralling for all 672 pages.Also get "lectures on ancient philosophy" to go into more depth+books
Completely idiotic and disgraceful+N+Perhaps Malkin would know better than to write a completely idiotic book that disgracefully bashes liberals while doing nothing to prove that conservatives are any better because they aren't. All fault finding and no solutions. If Malkin really was a conservative, she wouldn't have shown her intolerance to others.

Disappointed with this book+N+I have read all of Patricia Cornwell books and love them all. Except this one.  I just liked it.  It was okay.  Not what I've come to expect from one of my favorite authors.  I was excited to see that there were new characters and I did enjoy them - as much as there was to know about them.  However the whole story did not develop very well, and it left me feeling like I missed a whole bunch of the 'potential' story.  I ended the book feeling like Ms. Cornwell was trying to make a statement to someone with this book rather than telling a story.  Very disappointed.+books
A warning against Islamo - fascism+P+This book is a brilliant expose of Islamic fundamentalism and Arab culture, showing its threat to western civilisation.A true wake-up call to all who think safety can be found in appeasement.Brigitte Gabriel's credibilty is impeccable since she speaks as a Christian Arab who has experienced Islamic terror and Israeli democracy.She also gives the lie to the theory that Israel is the root cause of international terror.  Brigitte Gabriel is a brave beacon of light whom I salute as a truly righteous gentile+books
Wish I hadn't wasted my time, but saved by listening to story+N+I have long had the desire to read a Grisham book, because I have heard good things.  Well, my chance came and I was sorely disappointed.  The audio cd's were on sale at a truck stop and I decided to get them for The Chamber.  The opening to the book kept me going, but by chapter three, I had already decided this, "If Sam Cayhall lives I'm going to be mad because I get furious about hate crimes, and if he dies, he had better not die a martyr or worse yet the "hero" to the story."  Sadly, I pursued curious about the ending.  I'm very glad I got the cds instead of the book, because it only took six hours to get through it.  Sure wish I had those six hours back and the money invested so I could try a diferent author.  Mayber Grisham's other books are better, but I won't be reading them+books
AWSOME!!!!!+P+This was the first Nora Roberts book that I had read and it is now, I think, my most favorite book I have ever read.  I have never been interested in reading a romance before, but this struck me as being different and it was!  It has romance in it difinately...very good romance I might add...but it is a thriller!  I couldn't put it down and I'm not kidding!  I read this book in a week and it normally takes me close to a month because I just don't have that much time to read.  I found my self MAKING time to read THIS book! It is very graphic with the murders, rapes and animal killings, but reading that kind of stuff doesn't really bother me.  It's seeing it in a movie that I can't handle.  But I think Nora Roberts knew what she was doing by making it so graphic.  You just want to KILL this guy, and you find yourself prying your eyes open even when your exhausted and want to go to bed just to see if maybe on the next page you figure out who this guy is.  Not only is the suspense awsome, but her characters are great. You just really get involved with them and really feel what they feel. I loved reading about the girls learning to run a ranch, ride horses, and heard cattle and stuff like that.  Everything about the book is just awsome! +books
Readalbe but junky+N+Timeline is equivalent to a 99 cent taco. It's an indulgent bit of junk food. Timeline starts with a Hillerman-esque scientist turning up in the middle of New Mexico - an intriguing idea, but goes to the land of mediocracy right after that filled with cartoon characters. There are so many preposterous story elements that it's just really difficult to take seriously. The story is ever-predictable and ludicrous. But, a 99 cent taco is worth the effort if you're real hungry. Go back and read Andromeda Strain.+books
This is sick+N+I picked up this book read the reviews on the cover and was up for a funny book.  The book was anything but funny.  I read about half, up to the point where he was in a mental institution and could not read anymore. I consider myself fairly liberal but this was too over the top for me.  The graphic details of his homosexual love affair with a 33 yr. old was just sick. I am not sure where this belongs as a novel or a memoir but I had to throw it away because I did not want my children to get a hold of it.  I found the whole thing disturbing and failed to see the humor in these sick, mentally ill characters. I started hating them for the abuse they put their children through+books
Enthralled+P+This is probably one of my favorites.  She has characters you care about from the beginning and the deceased father's entangling demands to inherit his property and money are an added way of punishing his children for his indifference to them thoughout their lives+books
Agitating+N+I found this book to be an ignorant one-sided look at the near-death experience phenomena.  I have no argument with the fact that it happens, or that many people have this take on the issue.  However, the author shot down every other possible logical explanation with heresay, exageration, and tried to cover up his lack of knowledge on the scientific aspect with psequipedalianism.+books
Captivating global spy thriller - but Ludlum died in 2001; who's actual author?+P+This is as exciting and convoluted as any of the master's thrillers; prior reviewers have detailed the story sufficiently. I'll only add that the plot's twists, turns and surprises continue right on up to the final paragraph in the epilogue.  Although I enjoyed the story immensely, I had the sense that the action scenes lacked the "Ludlum Strategy" of realism and credibility [after all, how can many times can one super-agent overwhelm four or more opponents singlehandedly; or one untrained woman knock out two professional killers?].  On checking the book's front pages, I learn that the 'Ludlum Estate' (the author died 12-Mar-01 in Naples, FL) commissioned a "qualified author and editor"; the unanswered question remains whether this book -- prominently displaying Ludlum's name -- is an updated previously unpublished manuscript, a thriller developed from a premortem story outline, or whether the commissioned author wrote this book singlehandedly.  If this is indeed an original de-novo piece of writing, then the true author deserves not only a great deal of credit, but ought to publish under his/her own name rather than remain anonymous; s(he) would make a genuine contribution as an independent, skilled and accomplished writer of thrillers. I have the uncomfortable gut sense that this ship may be flying under a false flag ... unless and until the authorship provenance is more fully clarified+books
Excellent compilation on Leadershipattributes for innovation+P+Excellent compilation on Leadership attributes for innovation and is a collection of well written articles which made me think and connect to a real world phenomenon. I enjoy reading Peter Drucker's books and the content of the book has Peter Drucker's flavor to it. The Clarity and style of this book is truly outstanding+books
ANY  TONY  HILLERMAN  BOOK+P+A FRIEND RECOMMENDED TONY HILLERMAN AS SHE KNEW I READ MANY MYSTERY BOOKS. I BECAME ADDICTED TO HIS WRITING AFTER THE FIRST BOOK.  I NOW HAVE COPIES OF ALL HIS BOOKS PLUS A MAP OF THE TERRITORY IN WHICH THE STORIES TAKE PLACE. IF YOU LIKE MYSTERIES WITH A SLIGHT TWIST AND A REASONABLE ENDING, YOU WILL ENJOY ANY OF THE HILLERMAN BOOKS. +books
avoid this book at all costs+N+This author claims that the Baudelaire children cannot see through Count Olaf's disguises, which is patently absurd, as any reader of the Snicket series would know.  She has squandered all her credibility by making this absurd claim, and I would not recommend this book to my dog as a chew toy, let alone to anyone to read.   Either she didn't read the books, didn't really absorb what she read, or most likely, merely skimmed the books and paid little attention to them in her haste to capitalize on Snicket's good name.  Don't read this book, don't get it from a library, it is a big waste of time.+books
Failing and Then Succeeding in Creative Efforts+P+The author encourages us to recognize that making mistakes is part of creating.  Experimenting, finding what works and what doesn't work, and going on is the process of creativity. This book is useful for the beginning and the experienced artist+books
Great continuation!  Must Read Series!+P+What a fantastic continuation of the "circle" series. This is a must read for anyone who fancies an escape. Ms. Roberts' keen ability to create characters   as well as her attention to the finest detail is extraordinary! Highly recommend these books+books
Out of Date Before it Was Printed+N+While there are those who would give this 5 stars even if it featured nothing but dancing elephants, those with any amount of knowledge of the present state of scholarship will find these essays somewhere in the range of speculative-outdated-appalling. Cavin -- the man who invented the "Jesus had an evil twin who faked the resurrection" theory -- makes for an intro that may as well have come from Acharya S. Martin and Drange need an education in how an honor and shame society worked. Derrett? I wonder how he gets away with an argument that amounts to racial stereotyping ("Jews are good with money") in this day and age. Carrier does the watusi to get out of the consensus on the meaning and understanding of resurrection.  You know me, then you know where to go+books
Quite Effective+P+...but not all that affective. Which is not a bad thing at all. Unless there are noble attempts at such a thing, which, I suppose, is really up to debate with this work. But what expectations can one have with a work like this? What the reader has here is not really a "novel" but something greater, something post-, something meta- (although in a bearable way, at least Barnes has taste). It is, however, quite educational, very witty, very stylish (in a good way, see "Barnes has taste" in the previous sentence for more on this) but also often quite maladroit, even if in a skillfull way. Sometimes, especially in the times when the focus is shifted to the narrator, it feels like the story is being poked into an uncomfortable position, before it returns to its natural form in the next chapter (like the metal in braces!). But, it is, at the very least, a rewarding book and at the best quite brilliant. Very muchso indeed+books
The translation is a problem - the stories are not+N+My introduction to Borges was through the collection Labyrinths. I immediately fell in love with the stories, the prose, the poetry, and so went on to buy this complete volume. While it is nice to have all Borges's stories in one place, and at a reasonable price, the language doesn't really hold up for me. The translation is... well, not sloppy, but too simple, like those childrens' versions of classic novels they pressed on you in 5th grade. I have nothing against Andrew Hurley, but his translation of Borges leaves me cold. I'd give Borges 5 stars out of 5, but Hurley? No more than 2.+books
Little more than a collection of anecdotes+N+Intrigued by the relative frequency of citation of this book in the new "web 2.0" universe, I was disappointed to find only a sequence of factoids on social experiments and little in the way of analysis.  From the very beginning of the book the reader is invited to agree with the central thesis (that a crowd of independent individuals does better than a smaller elite group) and it very much feels like evidence is carefully selected to reinforce the author's argument.  The book could have been twice as thin without losing much of its substance.  I would qualify it as a light business read, entertaining but not quite convincing if you're not part of the choir+books
A good book, with one reservation.+P+Not only is this a very thorough book, but it is available from  Amazon's 'new & used'  sources  for  quite a low price, considering how recently it was published. I recieved a hard cover edition for 5.94!  I only have one complaint: Most of Ilg's promotional photos on-line show him using an elaborate system of yoga blocks, presumably to enhance the forms' effectiveness. I was quite interested in this aspect of his training, and  was, ( I feel, rightfully), assuming that the book would elaborate in this direction. Unfortunately, there is no mention whatsoever of the blocks and their uses here in the book.  Why+books
Undesirable+N+It's the polar opposite of good writing.  It's so familiar, so conversational, so unturgid, and so padded with fluffy stuff it's unreadable.  Even worse than I figured it would be.  Oh, well, now i know after wondering all these years.+books
How Sad............+N+I think I've read most of Mr. Woods' Stone Barrington novels, enjoying them thoroughly - BUT this is a sad addition to the collection. He just called this one in - unrealistic plot, unresolved plotlines, bad dialogue.......I think he's unfortunately succumbed to the 'publisher's lament': "You just HAVE to release another Stone novel this year!" There's no pride of authorship in this book - it's strictly a throwaway....and the circular bin is where it's ended up......+books
Not what it appears to be+N+The play "Into the Woods" not only contains sinister elements, but has an overall dark message to convey.  It preaches moral relativism as blatantly as any catechism teaches religious doctrine.  It teaches is that lying, stealing, cheating, and even murder can be justified as long as it is not against one's perspective on life.  Also, that life is grim and experiencing things forbidden will help you.  This religious doctrine of corruption is conveyed through the story and through specific lyrics of the songs+books
Mediocre... good for healthy advice, bad for recipes.+N+Like many of the other reviewers, I found this book frought with recipe mistakes (or are they just sloppily written?).  However, many of the recipes, with adaptation, become quite nice.... the problem being that you must have enough cooking knowledge to know how to adapt recipes.  What's great about this book, though, is the plethora of information about food itself, mini-articles about things like mushrooms, green tea and how to grow your own herbs make for some great and informative reading.    Interesting and a great idea, but very poorly executed.  A good and thorough revision would make this book wonderful, but this edition is just not that great+books
Way too boring and confusing - couldn't finish it+N+I have been trying to read this book for over a year.  I can't get into it and I think it's time to throw in the towel.  I have gotten half-way through but the author jumps around too much.  The stories are interesting but don't really seem to have anything to do with one another.  Too many characters - could use a cast of characters or map showing how characters are related at the beginning.  The upside is that the individual stories are well written and it addresses some interesting topics. +books
Good, in a classic sort of way+P+This book is not for everyone. If you do not like to read classics with everything that goes along with that (such as long-winded language that seems outdated to us today), then you should stay away.  For lovers of classical and relatively easy to read literature, this is a good book. A lot of things are amazing, considering how long ago they were written and what overall level of scientific knowledge was at the time. Some of it just boggles my mind.   At the same time, the book is long winded and in the end, not quite as much happens as one would expect. Dan Brown's DaVinci code has more things happening in the first 20 pages than Verne has in his entire book. But that is OK in a way, because when I read a classic, I do not expect to compare it to modern standards. The entertainment is due to different factors. In fact, the way the book is written is part of the entertainment and not just the story.  I do not give this book 5 stars however, because I was disappointed in the end, since not enough of the story really comes to a conclusion. I do not want to spoil the book for you, but there are a lot of unanswered questions, and getting those answers really was what kept me reading. There is quite a bit of build-up, and then in some ways, the book just ends. (I noticed that style in many books of that time, where the narrator just says "here is what I know... but I do not know the whole story...").  Also, to some extent, I agree with some of my fellow reviewers that gave a lower score, in that it is too much of a narration rather than a real story. I do not complain about some of it being like a log book, but I would have wished to get a bit more information about the daily life on board. I just do not buy that the 3 travelers just stayed in their room. They must have found out a bit more about other parts of the boat. Or at least attempted it, and that would have been interesting to read about, without breaking with the overall style of the book+books
One of Koontz's Worst+N+This is truly a disappointing book.  It starts incredibly slowly and I found it very hard to become interested in the plot.  Another disappointment is Koontz's recycling of elements from other novels: (1) plucky, highly intelligent disabled girl (the young female protagonist in "The Hideaway" had almost identical deformities and personality), (2) devoted, super-powered canine companions, (3) bad guys driving around in ultra pimped-out RVs, and (4) evil bioethicists.  The Leilani character is patently ridiculous.  She conveniently has a genius IQ, but that does not make the absurdly adult manner in which she speaks any more believable.  I found it so disconcerting as to detract from the plot.  Koontz clearly has trouble writing for children, and this book is no exception.  Almost all the children featured in his books are either autistic/MR or genius wunderkinds; the latter, however, does not justify his habit of making smart children talk like genius adults.  Dean heaps the hardships on poor Leilani, with all the subtlety of an episode of Walker, Texas Ranger.  In case you miss the anvils, you are supposed to really, really like her and fear for her safety.  I don't know how or where Dean Koontz learned about bioethics, but he has a terribly misguided view of the field, taking an extreme sect of it to represent the main viewpoint of the field.  Further, he states multiple times that these eugenic bioethics principles are being taught to medical students at major universities (who will have to pay for their involvement with evil bioethics) -- as a medical student, I can assure you that this is patently untrue.  That Koontz could be so off-base on a topic that directly relates to the central motive is disconcerting and makes an already weak book even harder to swallow.  The final issue is Koontz's near-deification of dogs, particularly Golden Retrievers, which is a common motif in his more recent works.  It is ridiculous and unintentionally funny to an almost painful degree.  His obsession with dogs and their mystical powers borders on the psychotic (and I like dogs).  This novel probably features the most egregious example of Koontz's tendency to create overly sappy, sugary-sweet endings.  Dean Koontz has written many books better than this one.  Spend your money on one of his stronger efforts+books
Boring Narrator+N+I have heard so much of this book and decided to get the audio CDs from the library. I was extremely disappointed with the narrator - who also happens to be the author. He sounds as if he is about to fall asleep and seems to have trouble annunciating words that end in "w" - it drives me mad. He reads in a monotone - no excitement in his voice - he just drones on and on.   I am a big fan of audio CDs because I can listen to the stories while doing other things - I'm not tied down to the couch. I have listened to many narrators - Jim Dale for one - and have never hated listening until now. Charles Frazier may be a "brilliant" author, and should stick with writing - period! Leave the storytelling to someone who has a personality and brings the story to life+books
Not what I thought!!+N+This book is written more like a textbook and unless you have a degree in Criminal Justice or something of that nature, it reads like stereo instructions!  Not impressed at all+books
Interesting story, difficult to read, see the movie?+N+I almost gave up on this book after the first chapter featured several paragraph-long run on sentences with no punctuation. I was determined to try though. Once I got used to the almost non-existent editing I was able to enjoy the story. It is a challenge, but the reward is an interesting glimpse of the cowboy life. I'm not sure the effort was worth it, though. Note to writers--employ editors so that your story isn't lost due to hard to read prose! It added nothing to the book to create a new "style" and made reading very cumbersome and frustrating. This is one of the few times that I wish I had just watched the movie instead+books
Surprise, surprise, surprise+P+Spellbinding takes on new meaning as this tale twist and turns through treacherous waters.  Just when you think Grisham can't do it again, he does it anyway+books
You could only dream :-()+P+For most people, this kind of lifestyle is only a dream, but wow, what colourful and beautiful dreams.  This book is choc full of stunning photos that reflect the wealth some people luckily or unluckily have.  Their houses (or should I say shrines) are treasures in their own rights, but the possesions inside are also gems.  The Tiffany theme is reflected in here all the way through and there is some stunning pieces.  This is a pricey 'coffee table' book, but it's so beautiful, you'll be glad you treated yourself or someone else+books
A rare perspective that demands a hearing+P+This book really helped coalesce in my mind that sometimes it's not the party, it's the man.  By serving Presidents from both parties, Gergen forces Republican and Democratic readers to set aside their party loyalty to confront the reality that both parties have had recent Presidential successes and failures.  For example, I was a proud Reagan youth who didn't vote for Clinton in 1992 However, by 1996 I had to admit that Clinton was doing an excellent job of leading the country in spite of my party's obstructionist activities that only hurt the country.  Gergen explains how Clinton was able to overcome and succeed in spite of opponents intent on political destruction rather than serving their country.  Gergen also provides excellent examples of what many of us realized by 1984 about Reagan, that while his rhetoric mainly appealed to the conservative right, Reagan was truly a President to all Americans and governed from the middle.  If are you interested in presidential politics and care more about the country than you do about your party, this is a great case study.  If you are a senior manager responsible for large numbers of people, this book is also an excellent manual on managerial success using your own style and approach.  If you are looking for ammunition to do battle against ideological opponents, this is not the book for you+books
Science? I couldn't get more disgusted.+N+Scientific? I couldn't get more disgusted.  This review is written because it can accomplish much, that is, let no one science-interrested person fall in this trap.  I did never read more than 20% of the book, that is a short one, I can only guess that its because there would been to much nonsens even for the most naive readers. I read until I had heard to much about the "revoloutionating discovery" (that you have not heard of in serious papers as Nature or New Scientist, why?)  This revaloutionary discovery etc. was a machine build by someone, that claims it could measure feelings, so for example it could measure in a black room when there was a big group of people feeling the same thing, maybe an OS contestant from USA (where the machine would be) winning the championship in whatever.  Well, then it was tested in superbowl but failed, the author explains this due to commecials distorting the feelings the public felt etc...  How would this machine be able to notice somethings like this? Well they must have checked out a list of "strange" topics from physics and chosen zero point energy that has to do with the vacuum. They could not choose something like electromagnetism, because that might be disregared right away by the public who might know to much about it.  Claims that the machine is working is based on odds for it not to be this way were apperently about 1:1000 (I don't doubt that more than 1000 of these experiments have been made and failed) The author also claims that there was a scientific explaination with the feeling an moon astronaut felt when he was away from earth, he felt connected to earth in some kind of way.  I laugh in disgust, noticing this book is nothing, absolutely nothing, compared to others that actually stand out as great books, giving you an "WOOOW!" but with a scientificually accepted material as background. Examples of these are:  QED: The strange theory of light and matter by Richard Feynman, who was one of three to individually invent Quantum Electro Dynamics, that is the most fundamental description of Electromagnetism. This book is based on a series of lectures Feynman made in University of Auckland, New Zeeland, to a PUBLIC audience.  Deep Down Things: The Breathtaking Beauty of Particle Physics by Bruce A. Schumm. A book staying focused on the subject that lies around particle physics, a Wooow! I got from this book was the connections between the mathematical Lee Groups and the quantum forces of nature (electromagnetism, the weak force, the strong force), discribed greatly on a non professional level+books
It's a gag gift, not as practical as the original+P+The original Worst Case Scenario handbook was a good guide, essential for your paranoid friends. I enjoyed that one, so for some reason my family has given me all the follow-on books as gifts. None of them really compare to the original, but this one comes close in some respects.  Many of the scenarios are completely outlandish, so don't buy this looking for practical advice.  Unlike the original, this isn't a book to buy your paranoid death-fearing friend.  Some advice is practical, like dealing with swallowed mistletoe, driving in a blizzard, or dealing with a canceled plane flight, but it can get lost in the more outlandish, like fending off unwanted kisses, jumping from a runaway sleigh, fending off a charging reindeer, dealing with a meddling parent, etc.  Some situations just don't boil down to 3 easy to follow steps and a diagram.  I do love the section on repurposing a fruitcake, though.  Enjoy this for a small laugh and pass it around amoung the adults for the holiday+books
Boring, boring , boring+N+Blech.  I hated this book.  I read a lot of "high drama" books about teen issues as I work with teens who find themselves in this genre.  Unlike Speak, or Crank, or even Cut, Smack is a book that doesn't connect with anyone.  Oh, and did I mention that it is boring?  Don't be misled by the other reviews, this insipid ride to unbelievable town doesn't belong on your bookshelf+books
not for day traders+P+assuming you are an investor as opposed to a trader, Fisher's book is an astoundingly important read. you will not find formulas or discounted cash flows, you read a genius's thoughts about the truly long view+books
You really wanna get bored...?+N+Read this book! The story of a half-Chinese, half Jewish halfwise autograph man, a drunkard and drug addict who doesn't get along with life, love and religion, sadly isn't even half-interesting or - behave - intelligent. In fact it is really annoying: the initial situation offers some some basic aproaches but Zadie Smith doesn't manage to develope them thrillingly. Anytime I felt just a little bit of excitement and turned the page to read on, it just started to get really boring again.+books
GREAT so far+P+I have only read 60 or so pages so far, but as other readers have accounted, I have a difficult time putting the book down. It reads like a hollywood movie, I have to snap myself to attention every-so-often to remind myslef that these accounts are true to life, that these things actually HAPPENED, which makes it even more gripping. The way the author goes from the experiences of the ghost soldiers and the prisoners on the death march is perfectly mixed.   Nicely Done+books
portrait of a writer as a complete bore.+N+if you ever meet someone who you have heard is a fan of this book, stick a pin in their arm to see if they are alive+books
The ROI of Magic+P+According to the authors, "This book tells the inside story of justhow Disney's success was achieved -- not by epiphanic flashes ofcreative insight that produced a Pinocchio or a Dumbo, but by the forceof a much-considered, carefully wrought process of managing innovationand creativity and by an adherence to a firmly system of beliefs."The material is organized within 11 chapters, followed by an Epiloguein which the authors observe that the integration and interplaybetween and among the ten principles they have examined can be ofsubstantial benefit to other companies. The "Dream, Believe, Dare,and Do Process" does indeed have all manner of potentialapplications for companies in industries wholly unrelated toentertainment. There must be dreams to believe in and courage topursue those dreams. Those who share my high regard for this book areurged to check out Warren Bennis' Organizing Genius, one of whosechapters focuses on the Disney team which produced Snow White and theSeven Dwarfs.+books
A quick read, but not her best+P+I've read almost all of Danielle Steel's books and I don't think I've ever bought one brand new.  I usually get them at Half Price Books for $2-$4.  This one caught my eye at the store when it first came out and after reading the summary in the back cover, I bought it.  Its a quick read, I got through it in only a few days.  Its a more diverse storyline than she's presented in the past, but the ending just wasn't believable.  Most of Steel's books end with a "happy ending" and although most of us want that, sometimes it just doesn't make sense.  The "meat and potatoes" of this book revolves around the tragedy that befalls a once-wealthy family.  The introduction of the 'bad guys', the buildup of the plot, the execution and then finally the resolution.  It seems that with 100 pages to go, Steel wants to toss in a romance.  Doesn't work!  She doesn't build the romance at all, not in a believable way anyway.  It seems one minute she's talking about a cop who's been with his wife for 17 years and "he'll never leave her" and the next thing you know...a week later he's in love with someone else!    Didn't like the ending, doesn't make sense.  This book could have taken about another 100 pages to draw that out, and that's something we didn't need.  Wait for it in the bargain bin+books
For those who loved &quot;She&quot; -- a disappointment.+N+If you expect the same wonderful experience you received from reading &quot;She&quot;, you will be disappointed by this book. Leo and party travel to Asia to search for Ayesha and experience similar, but somehow tiresome, adventures. Reread &quot;She&quot; instead+books
Manning sinks to new low+N+I didn't think that Manning books could get lower than Wrox, but I was very wrong.  Unless you are doing very, very simple Hibernate 2 or want to how to use XDoclet and Ant, this book is a waste of money. If I were the authors, I would return the money to the publisher. You can forget in depth examples.  This book has the most trivial of examples, but it does have pages and pages of exposition on why Hibernate is so cool.  The real meat could be put into a 12 page booklet.  With a publish date of 2006, this book needs to be more up to date. To make matters worse, some diagrams are incorrect, many pages are smudged and smeared and the book reads as an insult.  I remember the days when computer books were actually helpful and useful, this book brings modern tomes to yet another new low. I thought the on-line docs for Hibernate were bad, but this book is worse.  Wow.  Worse than Wrox AND worse than the on-line docs.  Makes me want to read an old VAX manual just for the fun of it.  This is the first and VERY last Manning book I will ever buy. The few I have read before I was able to get the gist by spending 20 minutes in the bookstore reading.  Peak and Heudecker should stick to creative writing as that is what thy do best in this book+books

Maddeningly Hobbyhorsical+N+Imagine a book filled with em dashes separated by the occasional non sequitur. There you have TS, a jumble of a hodgepodge of a melange. Occasionally delightful turns of phrase notwithstanding, TS is recommended only to bookish masochists interested in dogs of the shaggy persuasion. (Sterne's Sentimental Journey, on the other hand, is a masterpiece.+books
Great Read But Where Are the WMD She Claims in the Book?+N+I read this book in 2002 way before the Iraq invasion seemed probable.  After reading it (and believing that I was reading thorough reporting) I supported going after the WMD in Iraq.  However, now that we've seen how Judy can manipulate facts and her proven track record with no WMD found in Iraq I strongly suggest you read this book with a skepticism to truthfulness.  Some of the non-Iraq WMD reporting was very interesting and I learned a bit from that, but how do I separate fact from fiction?  As a result of being 100% wrong in her reporting and Judy's recent comments, "the analysts, the experts and the journalists who covered them -- we were all wrong," which is not true (read John MacArthur, Ian Williams and Joby Warrick), I think this book loses its credibility.  You may want to read it just to attempt to discern fact v. fiction+books
Delightful, My second copy of this book+P+Linnets and Valerians is even better than the Blue Hills, both or delightfully fanciful and intriguing books by my favorite English Author: Elizabeth Goudge.+books
A little long, but...+P+... the basic plot's the work of a genius. Roland and his Tet are carriors of the task to save a "Calla" village from an attack of so - called wolves. The task is fulfilled perfectly, so the newly grown Tet's about to move on which they'd love to do - BUT...  As I said above, the basical happenings are chosen and mostly also narrated afantastically, if the author would only have kept it a LITTLE shorter. E.G. the new Tet member's self - told biography shows some details which don't really wanna fit into the actual Tower story at all; all they show is how the guy came into this world, still Midworld, of course.  Most of the rest, however, is told fantastically, as I said above. When Eddie comes to talk to Calvin Tower about the house ground with the Rose on it ("Waste Lands" readers will know what I mean) or Susannah's mind is caught by another person, differently said: Detta and Odetta receive company, those facts are told GREAT!!+books

Tedious, Meandering, but Worth the Effort+P+Noll identifies twelve "turning points" in the history of Christianity, times at which the faith struck off in a distinctly different direction from that which it had been traveling.  He seeks to set forth the significance of each turning point and set it in its proper place in the broad sweep of history.  You cannot argue with his first few choices, although he seems to read more consequence into the events than may be warranted.  The fall of Jerusalem was indeed a watershed event, but Noll sees its significance in the formation of canon, clergy, and creed.  These three things formed after the fall, and would have formed quite differently but for the fall, but were not the direct result of the fall.  The main significance of the fall is that it freed Christianity from its status as a sect of Judaism.  Until Jerusalem fell, the premier church of Christianity was the Jerusalem Church.  The Jerusalem Church considered itself a sect of Judaism.  Until the death of the Jerusalem Church, all Christians everywhere would feel constrained to follow its lead.  One must wonder whether it was the Council of Nicaea or the Battle of the Milvian Bridge that was the second turning point in Christian history.  Nevertheless, the Nicene Creed's significance cannot be overstated.  The next turning point, the Council of Chalcedon, "settled" Christ's nature.  Although there is still disagreement among  various Christian denominations, most still adhere to the doctrine of Christ hammered out at Chalcedon.  Later "turning points" are more debatable.  Charlemagne's coronation may or may not have laid the foundation for Christendom.  You could make an excellent case for the proposition that we have Constantine, not Charlemagne, to thank for Christendom.  Some "turning points" aren't so much turning points as symptoms of greater movements within Christian history.  The English Act of Supremacy, which was basically an act of convenience for an heirless king, was more symptom than turning point, as were the French Revolution and the ministry of Wesley.  Noll makes this amply clear in the chapters devoted to those "turning points."  His most intriguing chapter is the last, as he maps out the survival of Christianity under Communist repression and the explosion of Christianity in Africa and South America.  This last phenomenon goes far to set at naught the arguments of those who see Christianity as irrelevant in the postmodern world+books
"Evolution Of The Stone"+N+Of all the books which dominated the discussion of analytic philosophy in the 90s, John McDowell's *Mind and World* was actually the one which most nearly brought home the prize of great philosophy without naughty bits: and this most nearly in the form of an inversion of Lukacs, "Reification and the Consciousness of the Professoriat".  His early Oxgaffes having been forgotten, McDowell was here free to offer an "unpolitical" account of contemporary thought drawing heavily from classic works.  But if the result is not quite Robert Brandom's linguistic Leninism, the reader ends up getting a story about "who's to be master" that has a little too much excitement squeezed into McDowell's oscillating queries.  Much as Brandom makes a hash of the relationship between formal semantics and "inferentialism", McDowell's account of Hegel's relationship to *Bildung* does not even crib Gadamer's "historically effective consciousness" as a corrective to his "uncritical" eudaemonism (those interested in Hegel's intellectual relationship to Aristotle would do well to look at Alfredo Ferrarin's book instead) -- and the excitement one is  forever waiting on with respect to Sellars is pressed into service for a thoroughly unserviceable treatment of Hegel's remark "in thinking, I am free, because I am not in an other" -- very much the product of Stoic philosophy, and very much militating against the "therapeutic" story about non-conceptual content directly following (with apologies rendered to Peacocke for his rather more serviceable story).   Is any of this that objectionable?  No, and although McDowell's work was very much "in a vogue" for a while (i.e., served upon you according to his lecture specifications) this (as well as his essays) is fine reading concerning stylistics with respect to thoughts of the form "whereof we cannot speak..."  But none of it is as thoroughly "Wittgensteinian" as presented, and if McDowell can still coherently be accused of rendering a disservice to that philosopher this heavily syncretist work must be counted as one such.  I expect this is not the case, however, and as such cannot in good conscience recommend this book to interested readers: if you are in the grip of a worry, perhaps you should stay there, and if you feel differently perhaps being notified of your pseudo-problems will not help overmuch.  Something of a lecture-stuffer+books
Fig Cheater+N+Huh? What happened to the ingested fig? To the excrement in the park? To the severed thumb buried in the floor? Yes these are major fuel sources that (up to a point) propel the plot forward. What happens, even in the broadest of terms, to the characters? To Wally for instance? Atmospheric yes and in some ways gripping but what a stinker of an ending.  For Amazon to sell this book with (and by implication to compare it to) the exquisite "Shadow of the Wind" shows either a seriously impaired scheme for pairing books (set in 20th century Europe seems the only obvious similarity) or a desperate attempt to pawn off an overrun of lousy books on the coat tails of a great one+books
Gerber Knows His Stuff+P+I'm an engineer.  I had the E-myth stuck in my head.  I KNEW how to run a business, therefore I could run a successful business.    Guess what?  Gerber is right!  Knowing all the technical details of running a business is not enough!  This book is simply awesome!  It perfectly described my mentality and my motivations for starting a business (I've started 2 businesses).  I've worked for 10 different companies and consulted with more than 20 others.  The principles and patterns he describes match with reality.    If you are thinking about starting your own business you MUST read this book!  It can save you YEARS of your life and untold amounts of $.  I lost my life savings starting my first business.  Reading this book helped make my second business a success.  If you are a business owner, you MUST read this book.  Chances are this book will help you understand yourself and your relationship with your company.  Your company and your employees will benefit greatly.  I highly recommend this book to any business owner or person thinking of starting their own business! +books
highly regarded book on design for engineers+P+Doug Montgomery got excellent statistical training at VPI. He also has a wealth of practical experience from his consulting work. His books on regression, statistical design and response surfaces are all well written and understandable to engineers. This 4th edition published in 1997 still contains all the useful information on factorial and fractional factorial designs. Chapter 14 is a wonderful up-to-date chapter that covers important process optimization topics not often covered in traditional design of experiments books. This includes response surface methods, mixture experiments, evolutionary operation and Taguchi methods. It does not require high level mathematics+books
skip the audio version+N+Here's the scoop:  The stories and essays in the book are hilarious, but the audio version is not an exact duplication of the paper copy - some stories are missing, and others have been added.  That's only part of the problem.  David Sedaris narrates, and he has a very monotone voice.  If you sit there and listen carefully, you'll find the stories quite funny, but if you (like me) do mindless tasks while listening, you'll find yourself tuning out the narration without any effort.  Then you'll have to go back and listen over again, only to tune out the next part.  Amy Sedaris has small voice parts in the stories, and her voice is much better at grabbing attention.  However, her parts are very small.  I wish someone with a more enticing voice was chosen to narrate, because then this audiobook would be a gem+books
They killed trees for THIS?+N+What a disastrously bad and unfunny novel.  The self-involved main character is pathetic and whiny, the "plot" is see-through and cliched, and the writing style is far below what can be found on any mediocre blog.  When people criticize chick lit, this is exactly the kind of book they're talking about.  It's shallow to such a shocking degree than when it tries to take itself seriously, or stretches for a literary flourish, it's absolutely cringe-worthy.  I find it hard to believe the people who've praised it here actually read the same book.  This was given to me by an acquaintance shortly after my engagement.  She said she didn't really like it but thought it would be "more my kind of thing."  Obviously not a person who knows me well.  Thankfully, it doesn't appear the author is terribly prolific, so readers don't need to worry about trying to stumble through page after page of show-offy navel-gazing.  I wouldn't say it's one of the worst books I've read, but it's certainly one of the most useless+books
Bad one+N+This book was awful. THe author is a bad writer in general. Also, as you can tell from her scary emaciated grin on the back of the book, she is NOT recovered. This means that she cannot distance herself from her disorders and therefore can't really write about them well. There is a tinge of smugness in her account, like, "Look how thin I am, I just CAN'T eat." It's boring and it's about a really lame person...she is incapable of living her life at all. She still lived with her parents for the majority of her life+books
Interesting time, interesting place+P+This novel tells the haunting story of two generations of a Wisconsin family brought together and torn apart by the lake adjacent to the family home.  Focused on four women, sisters of two generations, the novel develops around the sisters' relationship with the lake, and the tragedy that ensues when it claims one of their lives.  Much of the book is spent untangling the secrets which led to the drowning, and working out the complicated problems which arise from the family's attempts to keep these secrets.    Scwartz's story jumps back and forth across time, from past to present and back again.  This means that the story develops piece by piece, and this is what makes it something of a mystery.  I found the plot development to be one of the more satisfying parts of this book, seeing the pieces of the puzzle fall into place.  I enjoyed the developments leading up to Scwartz's telling of what actually happened the night of the tragedy.  After that point, however, I found the plot to be something of a let-down.  The conclusion seemed a bit too neat, and a bit forced.    The most enjoyable part of this book to me was the way in which Scwartz set the scene- the way in which she managed to capture the sense of a time and place.  The novel is set in the Wisconsin countryside in the first half of the twentieth century, with most of the action focusing on the last years of WWI, and the 1920s.  Scwartz offers a convincing portrait of Wisconsin farm country in the late-1910s and early 1920s.  Her descriptions are vivid, without being overstated, and her story intersects with several significant historical events, including WWI and the influenza epidemic.  Scwartz gives her readers a strong sense of connection to the seasons, the land, the lake.  I really did feel like I was part of the world about which she wrote.    Overall, I enjoyed reading this novel.  The development of the plot engaged me, and the scenery captivated me.  I was a bit disappointed by the ending, but my reading was by and large time well spent.    +books
Not for me thanks--a very incomplete, unsatisfying program+N+Let me first say that I've done this program several times over the past few years, and stayed on it each time for at least 6 months. It did not do much for me. My physique did not change, nor did the way i felt. I'm in good shape anyway, but I certainly did not build muscle mass. As far as strength goes, there's no possible way to test whether these exercises really build strength or not. I suppose you could subjectively say whether you felt stronger doing day to day activities, or test yourself with weights but neither of those is optimal.   I'd say that if you want to exercise without apparatus, and are interested in improving your appearance, conditioning, energy levels etc that there are more effective ways of doing so. Either Ross Enamait's books, or Combat Conditioning and Combat Abs would be an improvement. I do Combat Conditioning and Combat Abs  most days and they've done me a world of good as far as conditioning, strength and flexibility, which are all things Miracle Seven did not.  And, I don't spend more than 20 minutes a day doing them. For all the silly Furey marketing techniques (and he's as egregious as they come regarding his advertising) a combination of both of those Furey books will do far more for you than Miracle Seven, which is a very incomplete program that you'll need to add conditioning and flexibility work to+books
"Which is better - cheap happiness or exalted suffering?"+P+`Notes From The Underground' is a formidable work of philosophy and of psychology, not to mention its worth as a novel. In the space of around one hundred pages, Dostoyevsky manages to expound theories on reason, alienation, suffering, and human inaction. The book's importance and influence on generations of writers cannot be over-emphasised; Sartre and Camus are only two examples of people who have been directly influenced by this book.  The book is presented in two parts. Part one `Underground' is written in the form of the nameless narrator's rambling thoughts on reason and his claim that throughout history, human actions have been anything but influenced by reason. Underground Man's charge is that man values most the freedom to choose to act in opposition to reason's dictates. Dostoyevsky's critique of reason then, although it demands attention and is somewhat difficult to follow, sets the philosophical foundations for the rest of the book.  Part two `A Propos of the Wet Snow' is much easier to read, as the narrator recounts three episodes which happened when he was fifteen years younger and working as a civil servant in St. Petersburg. The first considers an incident in which an army officer insults him and goes on to detail Underground Man's subsequent internal anguish at his inability to commit an act of retribution. The second episode takes place at a farewell dinner for an acquaintance named Zverkov. The narrator is utterly disgusted with the company in which he finds himself but despite this, he is unable - even though he desires it - to make them realise this. The third episode details Underground Man's brief, painful and emotional relationship with a prostitute.  Dostoyevsky is refreshing in this book thanks not only to his incredibly powerful prose, but also for the intense but subtle way in which the stories reflect and indeed embody his philosophical theories. This dark and pessimistic portrayal of the nature of man may not sit very comfortably with many readers, however the ideas expressed in `Notes From The Underground' are as relevant and worthy of deliberation now as I am sure they were in 1864.+books
A Concise History of Italy+P+This book well describes the problems Italy was facing with foreign powers after the Roman Empire fell and how they regained control.  It really describes the Risorgimento well and included all of the major leaders  involved.  France's influence is also well explained and shows the series  of events, including the deaths of leaders and the creation of new leaders,  that shaped modern day Italy+books
A book of leftovers+N+Alas, this book was a VERY disappointing reading.  Its one of the biggest sins is having a misleading title. "SQL Server Architecture and Internals" ? Forget it.  The first whole third of the book is Win32 in a nutshell. It tells you about memory, processes, I/O and everything. But I already have my Richter dog-eared all right, I wouldn't need a reminder in a book on SQL Server.  Then, about the SQL Server. Internals ? What a joke. The only internals that you would find are names of the DLLs where this or  that SQL Server subsystem resides and a few hardcore debugger sessions to show you those DLLs actually get loaded. Uh-huh, thanks.   Can you imagine a book on SQL Server internals which doesn't mention pages and/or extents ? In-depth description of different execution plans ? This is the one.   What this book really is, is 20 chapters worth of overviews for more or less known SQL Server features. Average-to-good overviews of a less known features. Uhm, architecture, internals ? Nope - SQLXML, DTS, notification services, cursors, transactions. Take cursors - it says there are four types of cursors, you know, static, etc. and shows an SQL snippet for each. That's basically it. Take transactions - ACID, isolation levels and usage hints. Oh well, it could be worse...  Difficult to say without reading other books by the same author (not that I have an urge any more), but it appears he has written a whole series of them. You find sentences like "In my other book..." all over the place. Just love it:  [quote] I must confess that I was conflicted when I sat down to write this chapter. I wrestled with whether to update the SQLXML coverage in my last book, which was more focused on the practical application of SQLXML but which I felt really needed updating, or to write something completely new on just the architectural aspects of SQLXML, with little or no discussion of how to apply them in practice. Ultimately, I decided to do both things. [/quote]  Isn't it great ?  Oh, the chapter on Full-Text Search was hilarious. How about this:  [quote] Communication between SQL Server and Microsoft Search occurs via a full-text provider. This provider resides in SQLFTQRY.DLL in the binn folder under your default SQL Server installation. ... The sp_fulltext_... system procedures interact with it via the undocumented DBCC CALLFULLTEXT command ... Table 16.1. DBCC CALLFULLTEXT Functions [*** A TABLE OF FUNCTION IDS TAKING THE ENTIRE PAGE ***] ... As a rule, you shouldn't call DBCC CALLFULLTEXT in your own code. The function IDs and parameters listed above could change between releases  [/quote]  What a heck did I just learn ???  I thought this book would show me how to improve the performance of the applications that I write by knowing the database server architecture deeper. Instead, I got a book of not so bad overviews of different things for which there either was no coverage in the previous books or the author thought a quick reminder would be nice.  To be fair, some of the discussions were reasonably interesting, like chapter 12 "Query Processor", but give me a break, it's like 40 pages in a 1000 pages book.  Don't+books
Murder in Mesa Verde...+P+Ill Wind by Nevada Barr is the third book in her Anna Pigeon series, and the fourth book that I've read.  The more I read of Barr, the more impressed I am with her mysteries.  National Park Service Ranger, Anna Pigeon, finds herself working in Mesa Verde National Park, home of the Anasazi ruins.  This is a delicate assignment, trying to share the park with the public, while protecting the delicate ruins.  When bad things start happening, one of the park employees claim it is the chindi (or spirits) of the Anasazi, who are protesting the desecration of their sacred sites.  Each of these events is preceded by the appearance of a "spirit veil" over the ruins the night before.  But when a fellow ranger is found dead under mysterious circumstances, the National Park Service calls in agent Frederick Stanton of the FBI.    There are many theories as to what is happening in Mesa Verde.  Although unhappy spirits are not ruled out, the lack of truthfulness with almost everyone involved makes for lots of suspicious characters.    Pigeon and Stanton work together to a thrilling conclusion.  As with Tony Hillerman, I enjoy Barr's novels in that they teach the reader something new with each book.  With Ill Wind, we not only learn more about the NPS, but also, the mysterious Anasazi and the ruins they left behind.  It's an unsolved mystery why this civilization lived here for 600 years, and then disappeared without a trace.  We also learn more about Ranger Anna Pigeon with each book.  I would have given it five stars if it hadn't dragged a bit at the beginning.  Still, I have already started reading another Barr, Flashback.+books
The fat, ugly, hyopocrite American speaks+N+Hopefully THIS isnt the image the world has of the AMERICAN. If it is.....no wonder we are such a despised bunch.   First off....this book pretty much said nothing new. It is a "either you toe the line with US...or you are a traitor and giving comfort to the enemy" bunch of re-hash.Standard, neo-con, defense of each and everything that this administration does type thing.  The thing I found funny....I guess...is that he says WHY WE FIGHT? Is is just me....or do all the bloated, fat, wannabe heroes who write this stuff pretty much fit the DRAFT DODGER....sit in the back and start the fight and not get involved mold!!!???  Itis ALSO hard to read about how we should do all this from this virtuous air sack while he preaches to the masses and then does exactaly as he pleases at the gambling table.

Moral clarity....better get some DOCTOR BENNETT before you start pointing your fat fingers at everyone else!!!  I guess this would be good reading to someone who wants their already neo-conistic views confirmed...the same reason to listen to his ridiculous radio show. But the hypocrisy of this arrogant, do-gooder was almost too muc+books
Not one of Stuart Woods best work+N+I usually enjoy his books, even though they are formulaic, but this one was so thin in plot it was sad.  It was obvious from the get go who the bad guys were.  Of course there was the usual requisite sex scenes, even these were thin.  The dialogues were stilted. There was no character building if per chance you hadn't read his other books.  I agree with the reviewer who said this must have been a churn book.  I don't usually write reviews, but felt compelled to comment on this boo+books
Excellent Reference Tool+P+This is an indispensible reference tool whether you are just fascinated by food and drink and all things related or need information for backgrounding purposes. I have found it very useful. (Did you know that Dr. Pepper was created by a pharmacist from Waco, Texas in 1885?) The appendixes listing food websites, food museums, festivals etc. are quite helpful also.  It's well worth the cost and a "must have" for your libary, especially if you work in or deal with the food and beverage world . . . and if you just love knowing random trivia you'll love having these volumes to thumb through!+books
Some interesting insights....but based on faulty assumptions+N+I found the book to be an endless and somewhat unnecessary attack on classical theism.  Her notions of pauline theology, based on a platonic dualism, have been shown to be baseless.  The disparities and divisions of the church and society are not proven in her work to stem from classical theism, but are assumed.  The church which she diminishes has worked to bridge culturally created divisions, which she fails to admit to.  Her pandering into pantheism and panentheism are also disappointing, for she reveals her true intention of not reforming the church, but espousing a new religion+books
Quite Contrairy+P+It was worth waiting thirteen months to read the latest Alex Cross novel, and though it wasn't as good as some of the others, Mary Mary was still a great novel.  It introduced a new villian, and it gave Cross kind of a fresh start.  After finishing it, I was a little sad, but excited for the next Alex Cross novel+books
Survivor in Death+N+the beginning of this book was excellent, but dont be fooled, the first few chapters are the only decent part of this book.  the rest of the book is just filled with sex and the ultimate downfall is that there is no foreshadowing to the killers. what's the point of writing it if the reader cant try to figure out who the murderers were.  this was one of the worst books i have ever read, i'd call it a trashy romance novel with a hint of mystery. dont waste your time reading it+books
Inspirational+P+I was given this book recently and have to say it is probably the most inspirational travel book I have seen for many years.  As a founder of an adventure travel company (Intrepid Travel) I see many books of this ilk - but this is altogether different and better.  The pictures are fantastic and the copy very rreadable.  It looks at 40 destinatiions - some mainstream, some off the beaten track.  It makes you want to travel+books

This book is too fat+N+Rev. Dyson  dissects the great black man of the last century and attempts to get some insight into how his image translates to modern America. I found the chapter concerning Dr. King's embrace of democratic socialism to be enlightening, but I found the Rev. Dyson handing out alibis for King's adultery disappointing. Equally mind blowing is Dyson's using overblown language to assail the King family's efforts to control their loved one's image. I wonder why there are hard feelings, since Dexter and Coretta King talked to him for this book. This is an interesting character study that does draw some modern parallels, but would have been better if it were about 3 chapters shorter+books
A New Study of Lincoln+P+Abraham Lincoln's life and career continue to fascinate and inspire Americans.  Richard Carwardine's recent study: "Lincoln: A Life of Purpose and Power" joins a select number of outstanding works on Lincoln written by a non-American scholar.  Richard Carwardine is the Rhodes Professor of American History at Oxford University.  His book, fittingly, was awarded the Lincoln prize, the first work of a British writer to be so honored.  Professor Carwardine's study tells little of Lincoln's private life: his marriage, prior relationships with women, his personal interests, his depression, his sexual orientation, and other issues that have been explored in some recent works.  He seems to presuppose a knowledge in his readers of the rudimentary facts of Lincoln's life. (A duel in which Lincoln participated as a young man is mentioned twice in passing but never developed.)  Instead, Professor Carwadine explores Lincoln's public career, before and during his presidency, and tries to develop the traits of character and the circumstances that made Lincoln what he was.  Thus, Professor Carwardine devotes a great deal of attention to Lincoln's overwhelming ambition -- noted by virtually every writer on this subject -- and his desire to make something of his life through work and effort.  Professor Carwardine also emphasizes Lincoln's shrewdness, knowledge of human nature, ability to present himself, and facility at working with and blending together disparate groups and ideas.  These pragmatic, practical abilities would prove essential to the tasks Lincoln was called upon to perform as president.  Professor Carwardine emphasizes as well another, more thoughtful side of Lincoln.  His book describes Lincoln's role as a leader who endeavored to shape and mold public opinion rather than to be led by it. Professor Carwarding describes the fundamental role that moral conviction played in Lincoln's political career -- in his lifelong belief in the evil of slavery and in his devotion to the cause of democracy and the union.  The book describes well the development of Lincoln's religious convictions as he assumed the burdens of his presidency.  From his origins as a skeptic and freethinker, Lincoln developed a sense of a just and providential God directing the course of human events for reasons of His own. Lincoln's theology dovetailed at some point with America's evangelical Protestantism, even though Lincoln never became a traditional believer or practicing Christian.  Lincoln's religious sense and moral fervor, for Professor Carwardine, became essential to the leadership he provided during the Civil War, as evidenced by the Emacipation Proclamation and the Second Inaugural Address, among much else.  Professor Carwardine offers an insightful portrayal of American life during Civil War times, particularly in middle-America as he discusses Lincoln's rise to power in Illinois and the 1858 debates with Stephen Douglas.  He shows how Lincoln evolved during his years as president and how both his moral vision and his sense for the politically practicable were essential to holding the Union together and creating a sense of American nationalism.  As does much modern history and biography, Professor Carwardine is at pains to separate Lincoln, the hero and the cultural icon, from Lincoln the man, and from the facts of his life. But in spite of these efforts and of Professor Carwardine's own understated conclusions, this book presents the reader with a remarkable man and a remarkable life.  Professor Carwardine concludes: "While he was certainly not reluctant to wield political authority, his practical policy grew from a strong sense of moral purpose, and his course as president was shaped not by impouslive, self-aggrandizing action or self-righteousness, but by deep thought, breadth of vision, careful concern for consequences, and a remarkable lack of pride."

P L E A S E . . . buy something else+N+Many reviewers on this site read TLGPE in the 70's, when we were young and impressionable. (I happened to be 13 when I read it.) If one could be sued for intellectual forgery, Lindsey would certainly be found at fault.  Most of us, thankfully, have gotten past our fears that plagued our teenage years. After all, when we read TLGPE, we were young. We were searching and seeking. We didn't have all of the facts. There were wolves who knew this, and they preyed upon us. Many people who were older, yet still intellectually undeveloped, read this book and were moved to 'believing'.  For most of us, our minds matured. We began to see the vast chinks in Lindsey's pompous Christian armor. We began to realize that fear is a weapon brandished by madmen, by people who use a subtle, gentle cloth of manipulation to control others.  This is beyond dangerous. It is beyond extreme, as most of us have now found out.  I love a good horror novel. I love a good 'true crime' thriller. But the fact that people read Lindsey's books and take them at face value is, perhaps, one of the scariest notions I have ever imagined.  That, dear reader, is beyond horrific . . . and far more terrifying than anything you'll find in the bible or any of Lindeys 'books'. The only thing scarier is that Mr. Lindsey is still receiving royalties from an outdated, silly, contradictory and completely barbaric book penned over thirty years ago. Please don't be the next sucker. Please don't add this one to your cart. +books
Don't get me Started!+N+Because she is a real-life "Wife Of," Gigi Levangie Grazer has been hailed as the "on the inside" Hollywood chick-litter. Inexplicably, it turns out, because "The Starter Wife" is full of the vapid, name-dropping superficiality that any housewife from Nebraska could dream up.   Gracie is a "Wife Of" -- wealthy, toned, dyed and perfectly preserved, and married to a Hollywood heavyweight with one kid. Until Kenny hits midlife crisis -- he dresses loudly, gets an earring, and then tells Gracie that he wants a divorce. In the dizzying whirlwind of divorce, Gracie finds out that he's having an affair with Britney Spears (presumably in the months before she started slumming it with Kevin Whatsisface).   A concerned pal lends Gracie her Malibu house, so the newly-divorced can get her bearings and life back on track. And as she wanders the California beaches with her gay pal and married neurotic friend, Gracie finds herself desired by not just one but two men -- a handsome homeless man, and Kenny's dissatisfied has-it-all boss. Can she become more than Kenny's "starter wife"?   Okay, it has a different plot -- one that Shar Jackson might find emotional satisfaction in, admittedly. But the core of "The Starter Wife" is yet another thin plot, with a moronic heroine and lots of name-dropping. It's even worse that much of Grazer's name-dropping is out of date -- since this book went to press, Brad and Jen have broken up. So no one's worried about them procreating.   Grazer's lack of inspiration shows through in the storyline itself, which meanders aimlessly between Hollywood-expose cliches and middle-aged-woman-reinvents-self cliches. The writing meanders as well, as if the author is desperately trying to fill up space. Grazer even has the excruciating taste to name Gracie's gay pal "Will." It's not witty or cute, just embarrassing.   Perhaps the biggest flaw is that Gracie -- the wronged Wife Of-turned-Starter Wife -- is a pill. Despite the men going gaga over her, the supposedly smart Gracie comes across as a bitter airhead, obsessed with age even when she's feeling good about herself. Kenny is a cliche of the Selfish Ex, while Will is a cliche of the Lovable Gay Pal. Only Lou, a tired mogul who wants to know what people really think of him, comes across as a real person.   With more Hollywood tale-telling and absurd cliches, Gigi Levangie Grazer slumps even further in her sophomore effort. Sure it's just a fluff book, but it's really BAD fluff+books
Prose that's proud of itself+N+It's taken me a while to get through this book partly because I'm not very excited about the plot and partly because the author's self-conscious writing style really annoys me. There are lovely phrases here and there, but there are plenty of others that read like something you'd find in a greeting card--they try hard to impress and fail. The author makes deliberate, almost constant use of foreshadowing, perhaps in an attempt to get the reader to stick with the book and not lay it down for good. I'm contemplating the latter+books
Great Book+P+I got this book when my son was 2 months old. I find this book very helpful, especially for first time moms. The book is very clear, it tells you when to start your baby on solids, how much to give and how to prepare it, and much more+books
Not a developer book+N+I will have to put myself in the same corner as a few of my fellow reviewers, this is not a developer book, by far. It also has a lot of repetition in it. You can explain the different security groups twice, but 5 times seems like a little too much... The fact that web parts and customisations are not covered is like the biggest dissapointment to me, because that is what I am looking for in a book. How to use Sharepoint is something you can learn in the online help+books
APA  Manual+N+The manual helped my husband in writing his reports in the APA format. The only thing he recommends is that there should be more examples in the book. At times, he has to search for the items that were not clear in the internet+books
From Christianity...To 'Churchianity'+N+The author comes off as a whining, unhappy camper about having to grow up in what he considers a 'stifling' church environment; further apalled by the Church Founder's belief, in that it (the Worlwide Church Of God) was God's True Church through the ages, right on up to the present 'end time'. Feazell spends a good amount of time giving his negative opinions on Herbert W. Armstrong,the Church's actual teachings, and a general trashing and somewhat of a misreprentation of the general denomination as a whole, labeling it a 'cult'...and further damning its Pastor General as a "heretic", despite the Church's humanitarian works, publishing, Colleges and international outreach for world peace over the past seven decades under the leadership of H.W. Armstrong. Since Armstrong's death in 1986, Feazell and his cohort Joseph Tkach Jr. seem to be having a field day jumping up and down on his remains, and writing books on how great it feels to be loosed from having to keep the apostolic Holy Days, sabbaths, ten commandments (which, in his estimation are now the 'ten suggestions') and general lifestyle of this 7th Day Church Of God denomination. Mr. Feazell apparently does not speak for all the Church membership, as over 100,000 members left and formed various smaller independent Church Of God conferences throughout the United States...and continuing the legacy and apostolic, traditional Christian system of worship restored by Herbert W. Armstrong in 1927. Recommended reading: "Autobiography of Herbert W. Armstrong"; "Mystery Of The Ages"; "The Incredible Human Potential"+books
Fascinating+P+This is an excellent book. I have had the grace to see first hand two of the incorruptibles whose stories are detailed here by Joan Carrol Cruz (Saint Catherine Laboure and St. Bernadette Soubirous), and not even this wonderful book can prepare you for the experience.  While her research is sound, even first rate, Cruz has an easy to read prose that does not descend to the dry and academic. Although Cruz's style is reverent, at times even bordering on devotional, this is an excellent book for Catholic and non-Catholic alike, skeptic and believer+books
Long Walk...Worth the Trip!+P+Excellent autobiography that should be required reading! Mr Mandela has written thorough life history of himself and of the struggle for freedom and equality in South Africa. As long as it was, I just couldn't put it down.  Highly recommended!+books
Out of Ideas+N+Back in his day Heinlein was the greatest writer of science fiction for adolescent boys. Unfortunately, that day is long past, and Heinlein has wandered far from his strength.  This book fills in some gaps from Time Enough for Love and is a rehash of much of that story from an alternate viewpoint.  As was the case in Time Enough for Love, sexual coupling of old men and young girls is a recurring theme. Examples: The two female lead characters brag to one another how they had their first sexual experience at ages 12 and 14 and with men 4 times their age.  The male lead goes back in time and has sex with his sister, then a young teen, and he, at this point, the oldest man in human history.  To make all this go down easier, the young females are the sexual aggressors and the old men are pursued, and said to be 'tripped' if she has her way with him.  There is a lot more of this 'weird sex', but I will move on.  This is not really a science fiction story per se, but there are a few trappings of science fiction used to decorate the story.  Most of it takes place in the first half of the 20th century in mid America.  There isn't really a plot.  The book is a series of anecdotes occuring in the life of this unlikely heroine, seemingly Heinlein's feminine ideal.  It is obvious that the author has run out of ideas at this late point in his career.  This book would not have been published if it was the work of an unknown author. +books
Disappointing+N+I actually quite enjoyed this book until the last few pages. The individual stories of the pilgrims are relatively interesting (if a bit clumsy), all having some connection with Hyperion. Progress towards the story's climax on Hyperion seemed slow, but I assumed there would be some kind of closure to the story, which would also lead on to the next book in the series. Sadly, there is no closure to the story, leaving me feeling cheated. Most authors are able to find a good balance between providing a satisfactory ending to one story, and leaving you keen for the next one. Most annoying of all, the author completely pulled me out of his fictional world by dropping in a trite and annoying reference to 20th century fiction at the very end. I felt like the joke was on me, the author was deliberately trying to disrupt my suspension of disbelief. I'm disappointed, I feel betrayed by the cheap ending, and I shan't bother reading any further in the series.+books
Best  Book for  Christian Slaves rediscovering the Natural Earth +P+I really enjoyed this book.It was bound to be published,sooner or later.If the Library of Alexandria did not burn and collapse,society would have seen this kind of book much sooner.Many rebels and magicians would have withered in the piazza's stockades,for circulating such an explosive tome about Nature.Let it be published!Through christianity and islam and communism,these power structures have done nothing to promote world peace and caring for the environment.Those institutions destroy the haptic pagan ,who then becomes numb to the ways of Nature and her Earth-Magick.Scott Cunningham has became a lightening rod for ridicule by the pudibund neo-right.The average Wiccan today ,was still wearing nappies,when Scott passed away.He would be amazed and delighted by the growth of the Old Religion today. Some potentially good Wiccans of the 60's were stymied by drifting into the Red Army Faction,Malcolm X's panthers and the Kirshna-Moonies.This is a great beginners book for all open-minded people ,who want to channel their energies in a more positive way.When one destroys an aspect of Nature,one destroys part of the whole cosmic-web,in which we all live on. Wicca is not about devil-worshipping,or a gateway path into Satantism.Nor an idle trip into Lotusland.The amusing Hollywood b-flicks ,hash-out alot of the wrong sterotypes about true Wicca.Latest being the ridiculously inaccurate ,"Wicker-Man" movie.Use this book as a primer, and then research for more advanced Wiccan studies.-As Jim Morrison once said,"You're all a bunch of slaves!".So,Wiccans of the Earth Unite! You have nothing to lose but your chains of ignorance! +books
Didn't Hold Up Over the Years+N+What was an exciting adventure novel back in the 1970's for a young pre-teen (was I ever so young?) on re-reading now turns out to be a silly James Bond knock-off/Summer beach book. The most grating conceit is the author's habit of giving every *single* female charactor a "clever" name (Anna Bidet - French, Randi Knickers-English, Jemima Brown-African American, etc...). It hasn't aged well+books
Read &quot;As Nature Made Him&quot; by John Colapinto+N+Read &quot;As Nature Made Him&quot; by John Colapint+books
Entertainment and nothing more+N+I probably would have never read this book had I not received it as a gift.  However I am a fan of the occult and unexplained phenomenon, so I gave it a shot.  The book is entertaining; if only for the fact that her assertions about things like crop circles, the pyramids, and Atlantis are outlandish and fanciful.  Her research is morbidly flawed, she sites several websites, and never bothers to site any credible references.  It's important to note that the book has no bibliography.  Many of her conclusions are a result of information received from her spirit guide Francine, and it occurred to me many times while reading this book that perhaps Sylvia should take what Francine has to say with a grain of salt.    The book is rather light on content.  She tackles several "secrets & mysteries", however only dedicates a few pages to each.  Her chapter on alien abductions is barely three pages long.  For someone really looking to delve into unexplained phenomenon, there are plenty of books out there which explore these things in much greater detail and with more credibility.  But if the book happens to fall into your hands, you might as well read it.  It's good for some chuckles.  (Of course, it's not supposed to be funny.+books
Open Minded as I possibly could be!+P+I give this book 4 stars because I still have alot of questions and skepticism in some of the wildly, new to me, ideas in this book.  I like Sylvia Brown's deep sense of spirituality and her abilities have convinced me she is real at what she does. I don't think she is trying to fool anyone.  I am a seeker and am approaching the things she talks about in this book with as much an open mind as I possibly can be. The chapter on The lost continent of Atlantis was the chapter that was pushing me the most.  Although I do believe there is life in the universe beyond our own the Atlantis story is really out there.  Of course, I have not done any reading about this subject before so who am I to judge it. There maybe very similar views in other books about Atlantis and her explaination did make sense when compared the ages of people of Atlantis to those in the book of Genesis reaching in the 800 and 900 yrs old.  From crystal skulls to Loch Ness Monster to spontaneous human combustion it is all an interesting and fun read!!  But if you buy this book you will have to take what you can use and just leave the rest+books
A 'must' for any serious about Middle East affairs+P+Rashid Khalidi is the Edward Said Chair in Arab Studies at Columbia University: his Resurrecting Empire: Western Footprints And America's Perilous Path In The Middle East blends history, current events and social issues in a penetrating examination of America's growing involvement in Middle East affairs. Chapters document the history of such involvements and the likely outcome of the latest, drawing on the author's vast political knowledge to paint a more damning picture than most.

Ms. Seaman does not discuss bio-identical hormones+N+Although I agree with much of what Ms. Seaman writes about synthetic estrogen, (made from mares' urine,) and progestin, (synthetic progesterone), I strongly disagree that all estrogen is potentially "dangerous" to the female body.  (Pls. see Dr. Uzzi Reiss's comments on bio-identical estrogen in his wonderful book, Natural Hormone Balance for Women, in which he, (Dr. Reiss), states: "Currently estrogen is "under attack" as a major risk factor in the epidemic of breast cancer.  I find this ludicrous.  Estrogen is the hormone that distinguishes women's unique gender.  After 2 million yrs. of human evolution, could the female hormone suddently have turned into a serial killer?  Would nature suddenly decide to create a one-gender species?  Of course not.  Incriminating estrogen is as logical as saying that your liver is the cause of liver cancer." (p. 28 of Dr. Reiss's book).  I thoroughly agree with Dr. Reiss.  I, (along with something like 70% of women in menopause), had terrible symptoms of insomnia, lack of energy, lethargic depression, muscle/joint pain, and minor anxiety.  It took me two yrs. of physical symptoms to finally discover bio-identical estrogen, and I consider it a "lifesaver."  It has literally given me back my sense of who I was before menopause.  Within 1-1/2 hrs. of taking the hormone, I became in control of my mind and mood again, regained my stamina, slept better than I had in 2 yrs., and within a few days started to lose the excess wt. I had gained. My recommendation is that in addition to Ms. Seaman's book, readers might like to read Dr. Reiss's book, (from a purely clinician point-of-view,), rather than just a political one. Hooray for Tri-Est!! (name of the bio-identical estrogen formula I used).   +books
Dreadfully Boring+N+How can a best-selling author like Simon Winchester take an event as exciting as the San Francisco Earthquake of 1906 and turn it into a tedious snooze-fest? One answer: write as if you had just discovered an adjective mine and were free to throw in extra descripitive terms on every line until listeners scream for an end to florid phrases. Another: strive to break the record for most clich?s in a single paragraph. Finally: write about events in 1906 as if no one but Simon Winchester had ever before thought about their consequences -- thus, everything in this tedious narrative becomes about Simon. Simon and the raccoons; Simon on the failing American economy; Simon attempting to reproduce American accents. This is a CD set for avoiding+books
Worst book I bought on Amazon+N+I did not like this book at all. I speak clearly but I want to be more articulate and hold my "audiences" attention.    The breathing exercises and banging out the ZZZZs and EE-I-EE-I-OOs did not help me.  Maybe I just don't understand what the author is trying to get across so it could actually be good information.  I also agree with one of the earlier reviewers that this author seems to just drop a lot of names.  It got a little old after a while+books
Comforting+P+This book was a great start to my homeschooling expirience. It goes over all the myths and misconceptions and puts your mind at ease. This book was one of the first books I read about homeschooling and it was really encouraging and comforting. Linda Dobson writes in an easy to read fashion, Like a note from a friend or big sister. I have since bought 3 more of her books and even more from the publishing company 3 Rivers Press. Happy Homeschooling! +books
Gets Mt. Ararat wrong+N+Halley uses 17,000 ft. high Mt. Ararat in eastern Turkey as Noah's Ark's final resting place when the Bible says mountains of ararat in the book of Genesis. Also, old traditions attribute the Ararat range to a different area than where Mt. Ararat (formerly Mt. Masis) is located.   On other points he talks about humankind seemingly only 6,000 years old (as most Biblical versions claim if generations are taken literally in Genesis). Well, like another book written in the early 1960's (The Genesis Flood) this book is out of date badly on the age of humankind as DNA studies have since totally proven human life is much older than the few thousand years these books claim. Unlike the Genesis Flood this book seems to reflect the author's real genuine beliefs+books
Passionate and thoughtful+P+Subtitled "A Scientist's Search for Common Ground Between God and Evolution," this book is a thoughtful and serious attempt to resolve the question of whether a sincere Christian (or adherent of any other Western religion, which is his main focus) can also accept Darwinian evolution. In the first chapter, Miller recounts his religious Catholic upbringing, his introduction to Darwin (dogged by warnings that he was reading a "dangerous" book), and his later decision to enter the field of biology.   The next part of the book looks at the development of the scientific method and the theory of evolution, as well as painstakingly and devastatingly refuting the three major schools of opposition to it. He shows that the proponents of these "alternatives" misunderstand and distort science, continue using obsolete arguments long after they are debunked, and make no effort to do scientific research of their own while demanding that their ideas be accepted as science. He also argues that they present profoundly flawed pictures of God, as evidenced by his chapter titles: "God the Charlatan," "God the Magician," and "God the Mechanic."  Miller also tackles head-on the most legitimate beef of the anti-evolutionists, the use of "Darwinism" by many scientists to attack religion and to claim that if nature can be explained and understood, God is proven not to exist or life proven to be purposeless. He feels that it is as wrong to make these claims as it is to attempt to use science to "prove" that God does exist.  The final third of the book is devoted to a passionate and well thought out case that acceptance of the truth of evolution is not only not a bar to a sincere and committed religious outlook, but can be, in conjunction with other areas of science, an affirmation of it. I won't try to summarize or do justice to his argument here, but I believe that many who are more traditional than I am will find it convincing. I don't think that Miller will convert any atheists to his point of view, but that is not his purpose. What he is doing is reaching out to believers and offering them a place at the table instead of antagonizing them and pushing them away, without compromising his scientific integrity. His obvious enthusiasm for science and love of God make him a perfect person to do this, and given that people are most belligerent when they feel that their core beliefs are being threatened, it seems to me to be a very sensible course to follow+books
Shouldn't have "Raw" in the title+N+This book was disappointing because it was billed as a raw cookbook and it is not raw.  Get Juliano's "Raw" and "Rawsome" by Bridgette Mars and "Green for Life" by Victoria Botenko instead+books
A Very Good Biography Of A Unique Person+P+I've been a fan of W.C. Fields since my youth.  There was always something about him, a certain style that he had on screen, that was unique.  This book does tell the truth behind the real W.C., and dispells many of the myths that still are current about him.  He was a man that was in turn cantankerous, gentle, funny and poignant.    I for one never realized that he was such an avid reader.  Books seemed to be his passion, and all during his world travels as a vaudeville juggler he carried trunks of books along the way.  Anyone that reads so voraciously is bound to be an interesting personality.  His vast reading no doubt contributed to his comedy that involved the word play for which he is famous.  It is astounding to know that for many years in the early part of his career when he was a juggler, that he did his act in almost total silence!    A great biography that reveals the unique character that was W.C. Fields.  Written in a very readable style, we can learn about this man, warts and all through this book.  Highly recommended+books
Perspective Reporting that Are Way Better than The Well Worn War Stories+P+Mr. Minter comes through again with a hard hitting reporting style that comes up with stories that aren't reported adequately elsewhere in the media. Taking investigative journalism to places that other pontificators only dream about Richard Minter tells more stories about the War On Terror that Americans need to read. In a style somewhere between Tom Clancy and Bill Gertz, Minter delivers style and prose that is easy on the brain, flowing and captivating. I was glued to the pages. It was an enjoyable read that provided a great perspective into many under-reported aspects of the war.  His bias leaks through as a conservative and hawkish but the prose doesn't come across as an ideologue. He backs his information up with interviews and facts and provides supportive information that I found to be entirely persuasive. The material is well researched and he presents an exceptional bibliography for further reading. This is a book that everyone should read, conservatives and democrats alike. Minter finds pieces and interviews that no one else has and this niche makes for great exploration of the subject materials at hand. +books
Overly heady writing style+N+I found VERY little useful information in this book...not because it isn't there but because the writing style is too "out there".  I'm sorry I bought it+books
A Classic+P+My husband picked this book up since he remembers it well from his childhood. He wanted it in our classic collection for our children ~~ and this book definitely belongs there. It is a classic novel about life. The narrator ends up in the desert and while looking for water, he runs into a little boy, who just happened to be from another planet. And this is his story.  This is an observation of what it means to live. This is a story that pokes fun at businessmen, kings and so on ... but at the same time, it provides a sad truth that a lot of people miss when rushing around in life. The Little Prince talks about tending his own planet that only has one flower on it. He talks about love. He talks about hope and dreams. It is a very vivid story that makes you stop and think. And it is a classic ~~ I recognize the truths even sixty years after it was first published. It is still the same as it was then. Life is too short to fret over everything.   This is definitely a book everyone should read at one time or another and plan to re-read it over the years, as a reminder that life is precious.   10-27-0+books

high brow advice+N+Clearly John Gardner is a literary genius, however not being one myself I found that his style was a little overbearing, it does not offer the inspired start to writing fiction that I was looking for.  +books
The Definition of Trash+N+Trash sells and this is the definition of trash. Unfortunately many readers see this as history instead of fiction. Shaara who may have had a ghost writer obviously never visited a manuscipt library to do research. Readers should stick to reading the history of these events done by people who know how to research and how to write+books
Damage Control for the current President+N+I found this book to be based on a kernel of truth wrapped in innumerable layers of unconfirmable speculation (how many people really have access to intelligence agency archives?) and one-sided 'analysis'.  It is clear the Bin Ladin was 'lost' at Tora Bora when our troops were called back to garrison, allowing him to escape.  This goes even farther to the right than Micheal Moore goes to the left.  If you want a look at the subject from someone who was involved through several Administrations, read "Against All Enemies: Inside America's War on Terror" by Richard Clarke.  If you buy this book, you are paying for propaganda+books
Mediocre... good for healthy advice, bad for recipes.+N+Like many of the other reviewers, I found this book frought with recipe mistakes (or are they just sloppily written?).  However, many of the recipes, with adaptation, become quite nice.... the problem being that you must have enough cooking knowledge to know how to adapt recipes.  What's great about this book, though, is the plethora of information about food itself, mini-articles about things like mushrooms, green tea and how to grow your own herbs make for some great and informative reading.    Interesting and a great idea, but very poorly executed.  A good and thorough revision would make this book wonderful, but this edition is just not that great+books
Well, I'd like to say I liked the book...but+N+I couldn't read the whole thing in order to know for sure. It was dry. I didn't get the imagery - I know it's supposed to be a classic, and I really wanted to read the book, I did - but it was long and boring and I just don't get why it's so "classicly popular". Sorry, but it's how I feel. Now, that being said, I read a condensed version of it, and I discovered the story was a little bit interesting - but that's as far as I can go, even with the condensed version - it was only "a little bit" interesting+books
Do NOT Read This Book+N+Do not read this book. I attempted to read this book for a college class. This book should be cut down to the size of a magazine article and be published in a scientific journal. The public should not be misled into thinking that this book is readable. It is written at too high of a diction, and Griffin rambles on for 20 pages on one topic, which I won't spoil for those of you unfortunate to read this trash. The subject information is interesting, but this is written poorly, and will bore the reader to tears. Just thought I'd let you all know+books
Well written Mr Norris+P+I brought this book to kill some time on holiday.  But when I picked it up I could not put it down.  Bob Norris, an experienced Naval aviator is also a pretty good author which is not often the case when these millitary types pick up a pen. The novel describes a fly off competition to pick a new fighter/bomber but all is not as it seems as the hosts have a hidden agenda.  Each fighter/bomber has 5 events to prove it's worth and the one fault this book has is Bob should have put more flying sequences into the competion events instead of just giving a brief summary of what they did and the results in some cases.  The parts of the novel dealing with the fly offs are top drawer and if you like your aviation in books then read FLY OFF. Keep those books coming Mr Norri+books
Flynn's Best Effort So Far+P+This is the 5th book in the Rapp series (I've read them in order), and it is definitely the best so far.  The story is highly entertaining and action packed from the very beginning.  Flynn's previous efforts, while still very good, have all left something to be desired.  Transfer of Power was a little slower moving, Third Option and Separation of Power were too drawn out and should have been written as one novel, and Executive Power just wasn't a terrific story.  Memorial Day does not have any of these flaws.  All the strengths of his previous efforts are present without any of the weaknesses.  If you are an anti-military, excessively PC, or pro-bureaucracy, this sort of book is not for you.  But if you are a fan of 24, like one reviewer mentioned, you will be a big fan of the entire Rapp series.  I give it an easy five stars.  Can't wait to start Consent to Kill and Act of Treason+books
How did this ever become a national bestseller?+N+This nonsensical bio is written entirely from a blind feminist perspective.  The research is suspect.  The prose amateurish.  The details gossipy and contrived. If Eleanor Roosevelt was truly a woman of thought and progressivism, then Cook has done her an unforgivable disservice. If you're looking to understand Roosevelt's honest-to-goodness place in history, you will not find it is this intellectually offensive work+books
Garbage+N+I'm not sure why anyone would want or need a PHB2... I mean, come on.

The content is mostly all fluff, about the only thing redeeming about this book is the cover. +books
Better than Road to Serfdom+P+This was a brilliant book.  The language was much shorter and more precise than in Road to Serfdom.  I know that it was one of Hayek's traits to not use mathematics, but it would have been nice if he demonstrated some of his ideas with at least a little math. Or gave us the references if we wanted to look them up right at the bottom of the page.  Particularly neat was his off-setting things that were not critical to the argument in small type.  As it stands, the book is almost 100% empirical evidence of why socialism doesn't work. And kudos to the author for calling Socialism and Communism what they are, which is religion+books
this is what a loving marriage is about+P+Although many readers have commented on Elizabeth (a truly captivating character), her husband Isaac has been given short shift. He appears in one of the book's most poignant scenes as he straightens up after the Rosh Hashana dinner and, in an act of private accounting, chastises himself for his reluctance to support his wife in her desire to open a store. Analyzing his failings with the same critical eye he might bring to a scholarly text, Isaac then resolves to mend his ways. This scene is almost unsurpassed in its portrayal of a tender and intensely religious Jewish sensibility (surpassed, in my reading, only by Chaim Grade in the closing section of the second novella in his magnificant  "Rabbis and Wives").+books

Art is great, story....not so much - Buy when paperback comes out+N+The general feeling I had left after reading through this graphic novel was, That was it? Costing anywhere between 17 and 25 bucks this title hardly pays for itself. The book overall has a couple of different stories split up, all set in the Halo Universe. A good way to describe this book is, it's like the Animatrix, short stories based in a specific fictional landscape that are at best, cool and at worst mediocre. The art in every one of these short stories in this book were all top notch but, the shortness of the short stories just left me with again, the feeling of: That's it? My suggestion to Halo fans out there? Wait till this comes out in trade paperback form when it'll be about 10 bucks, then it might be worth buying.+books
Anger no more+P+From the first few pages, I knew that I'd stumbled on to something that was going to be extremely beneficial to me. The themes in this book are so relevant and I felt relief everytime I read something that was familiar to experience.  Angry women get this book+books
why a classic?+N+I figured if Oprah wanted America to read this book that it couldn't be too bad. I had held out on reading Faulkner, and now I know why. I read alot and love reading but this book, and "As I Lay Dying" makes me question why oh why Faulkner is a classic. My hypothesis is that its so unapproachable therefore people think it must be brilliant. This is a good book for english class when you can sit around and discuss the meanings of it all and read sparknotes together. This is not a book for sitting at home and reading for yourself. If you want to know the story just go read the sparknotes version. The book itself is too hard to figure out and there is little plot. its just a long headache really.+books
The Bible of Economics+P+A masterful volume.  The breadth and scope of this work leaves one breathless.  Oh, if only the world would read and understand this - we'd all be better off..+books
The Most Disgusting Character Ever+N+I actually read this entire book just to see if/how Beatrice would get what was coming to her. Yes, the book is about incest. The ads and cover I've seen for this book state something like "Murder, Incest, Betrayal" or something like that so it should come as no shock that it is about incest. The thing I didn't like was that about 2/3 of the book seemed to be about nothing but sex. Sex scene after sex scene. I frankly belive it's better to leave it to the imagination. We all know what happens when you have sex. But really it seemed more wrong that Beatrice and her brother acted like a couple in love. It wasn't just the incest that was gross. Gregory's descriptions of other physical things left me queasy at times. After everything, I think what Beatrice did to her husband had to be one of the vilest acts I've ever read. This book was at the most okay and I do not recommend it+books
Don't waste 3 hours of lifespan reading this book+N+This book is widely known as a classic, but the reader is left wondering "why?" Protagonist (can't call him a hero) of this novel is poor farmer Ethan Frome, who lives a joyless existence with his hypochondriac wife. He finds some "excitement" when Mattie comes to visit, but again, the reader wonders why, because she's vapid and uninteresting.  To recap: we're presented with characters that aren't the least bit likable to begin with, and turn pages eagerly waiting for The Happy Ending. Instead, Wharton ends with all three characters living together and making each other even more miserable. I feel like I wasted three precious hours of lifetime reading this book. WHY???+books
Huzun Redux.+P+I returned  from my 6th visit to Istanbul a couple of days ago. I took along Pamuk's book thinking it might be fun to read about the city  during my stay... This  is not really a fun book to read, though it is a good one. As one reviewer pointed out the translation is very well done.  The style is smooth and flowing. If you can't visit Istanbul in the grips of winter, Pamuk's  book will give you some idea of what it is to walk alone through this great cities back streets and alleyways  and to  feel history  rising up to meet you at every  turn. There really is a special melancholia to Istanbul in the winter and Pamuk captures it  perfectly.+books
history buff+N+The author could have added so many details that were factual and actual events and, yet, were so compelling and riveting.  This book lacked substance and depth.  You don't really experience the life or the personal conflicts that played out in the French court.  It was also too sympathetic to Marie Antoinette and highly unbelievable.  There were also so many missing pieces that could have explained more clearly what led up to the revolution.  I know this is a work of fiction but the true historical events and figures that took place were much more interesting than all the fictional events and characters the author created. +books
Torrential torrents and other nonsense+N+The first line in the book talks about rain as a torrential torrent.  It gets worse.  But who am I to say?  I quit on page 39, shortly after the black belt 72 year aunt old scares the traumatized dog into the bath by putting on a ninja mask and jumping into the kitchen screeching, "Eyowwww."  Beyond awful+books
Pathetic+N+I'm not surprised that many of the reviewers here gave the books such high marks.  Their reviews, much like the book, are littered with misspellings and other inaccuracies.  Perhaps we can blame this on the evil Conservative Right-Wing establishment known as our education system....oh, wait....it's largely Liberal?  Holy cow.  Oh, sorry, a religious reference.  Shame on me+books
Art classes for young children+P+This is a very well designed book for an art teacher with small children. It gives lots of ideas for art projects+books
Nothing new in this series+N+Mr. Griffin has a formula.  One formula, with one character and nothing changes.  This book, the entire series, and in reality all of Mr Griffin's work is nothing more than the literary equivalent of marshmallow creme only with less flavor and nutritive value.  I recommend it for use as a soporific or in a pinch toilet tissue+books
Censor the Garbage+N+Crying of Lot 49 Flat - Senseless - One dead accumulation of words - In,fact this book is, at times, so porely constructed all reviewers who herald it should be lead directly to the meat grinders. A book worthy of burning.  Has writing become a whim of the well read, a process of linking obsure facts only to then be skewed by prolix innanities as simple segways to streams of consciousness Poor Plot Poor Writing  Read - Umberto Eco's Foucaults Pendulum. If you are looking for conspiracy. Do not read this book (unless you have time to waste or have by some possibility exhausted every other option on earth)  +books
Eye of the Beholder+N+Musty, dated, old boy humor of the kind floating around breakrooms and water-coolers. This stuff wasn't funny when the vaudeville hacks were doing it. I like Mr.Asimov, and probably would have been somewhat charmed by his delivery(maybe). All in all, read Benchley or Woody Allen again for literary laughs and leave Asimov for the 3000 other genres he dabbled in+books
In the mode of a teenage girl's diary+N+The biggest disappointment of this book is that the comments about the CIA - training and operation - are akin to what might have been written at the end of the day into a diary.  There was passage after passage that begged for insight that her (limited) experience brought, but I don't remember a single case of finding this.  The criticism of the CIA training is rendered in terms of the students' shortcomings in the exercises, with no thought to why they didn't do better, or if their performance - while not good - was in fact passable.  I suspect that the people from the intelligence agencies that gave high marks to this book are doing so because they find the public criticisms of the CIA refreshing and useful/needed, and that they could fill in the insights on their own.  Despite having read multiple of the reviews here, I was still unprepared for the sheer amount of time talking about her personal life (one reviewer overstates it as being 75%) and how trite it was.  The reviews here had prepared me for the arrogance of a 30-something, but what I encountered was more the self-absorption of a teenager.  The librarian who shelfed this book in the teen section may have been making a different editorial comment than the reviewer (2006-Aug-15) who reported it (reviewer gave it 5 stars for the teen reader).  The book has many hints and clues that the author is substantial and interesting, and this may keep you reading. However, that person never emerges+books
Disappointed+N+The Professional Edition appears to be missing any information on at least 2 new Photoshop CS2 features; Smart Sharpening and Reduce Noise. It has sections on Sharpening and Noise BUT does not cover the new CS2 commands. I have not been through the whole book but this situation took me by surprise+books
Fascinating!!+P+It really made me think.  As a rule, I don't read religious books, but since this one was recommended to me, I ordered it.  I wasn't sorry.  It's an easy read, and I enjoyed it very much+books
Incredible Book+P+I purchased this book to find out about the publishing industry and more effectively market my book.  Without Mr. Kremer's Book I would have been clueless, however now I am well informed and continue to sell my book.  It has been picked up for a second edition by another publisher, which was my main goal.  ( I self published as a quick way to get review copies out to the public and get the book rolling)I knew the world needed my book and I needed it releasedquick.  Mission accomplished.  I keep 001 ways close to my side and continuously consult it as I continue my publishing journey.  Highly recommended to anyone who wants to sell books and be successful and effective in the process+books
Great read+P+I thought this was a very good book and would recommend it to anyone who likes this type of book+books
A toughie. +N+Considered by many who should know (e.g., E. M. Forester)to be Woolf's most brilliant work of genius, The Waves is a challenging book to read for many reasons, not the least of which is the style she has adopted. More like an extended Greek chorus than anything else, the six characters, whose "voices" sound identical to one another, speak their life stories in short, alternating monologues.  Although the writing is very poetic, it is also very dense and very distancing. We never really warm up to any of the characters or get involved in their stories.  I had to read this book for a class and, though I'm glad I made it through to the end, it was difficult going and I know I never would have finished it (or even gotten through ten pages of it) if I hadn't had the carrot of a grade hanging over it. We had to read the whole thing in a week which is really not a good way to tackle this book. Best read in small segments, leisurely, absorbing each moment Woolf choses to highlight. Definitely not a plane or beach book!  If you haven't read Woolf before, this is not the book to start with.  Mrs. Dalloway is, in my opinion, the best and most accessible of Woolf's experimental fictions and a good starting place for access into this great 20th century author's works. Then, if your brave, move onto "To the Lighthouse" and then, shudder, "The Waves.+books
A brilliant but flawed man+P+After watching the film, "Finding Neverland", I was curious to learn more about the fates of the 5 boys orphaned in the story.  Although Barrie did not gain custody of the boys, he did maintain a strong presence in their lifes. In fact, he did much more than just keep an eye on them over the years.  He showered them with gifts; traveled with them; and of course, financially helped them.  He seemed particularly obsessed with the older boy, George.  Barrie loved to photograph all of the boys and some of the photos included in this book show the children naked.  Was Barrie a pedophile of sorts?  None of the boys ever accused him of such.  And Barrie's love and concern for the boys did not end when they became men who were tall enough to tower over the diminutive playwright.    This is a comprehensive look at Barrie's life without passing any judgement.  That is left to the reader.  And after reading this book, I have to say that I'm STILL unable to figure the man out.  He is an enigma.  There are tons of photographs - one or two on just about every page.  Original correspondence and notes from Barrie's diary/journals add further insight.  A fascinating, and sometimes tragic look back in time+books
Truly a great read, but pornography it is not+P+I love the review before mine by ComicCostumes, the one line dis-- I've read his other review of a japan anime video where he commends the "well placed panty shots."  I can see how Bare disappointed him.  Pornography it is not.  Instead it is a woman examining sexuality, power, control and other dynamics in the context of five women that work in a Seattle peep show.  It is a study of a culture not many of us get to see.  And, as ComicCOstumes learned, little of it has to do with lust for sex.  For some it has to do with survival, for others power, for others simply a freedom to feel good about themselves and their bodies.  For the men on the receiving end of the lap dance it must come as a real let-down.   +books
The complete Dickens+P+Immediately upon starting Dickens' "Our Mutual Friend," I was struck by parallels with Dumas' "The Count of Monte Cristo."  Both big novels revolve around a powerful character who conceals his identity in a complicated plot to obtain social justice.  The Count deals with the darker theme of revenge.  Our Mutual Friend is an exploration of the corrupting influence of wealth.  The novel is lively throughout, as  Dickens displays his tremendous diversity of writing talents.  The tone ranges from heavily ironic criticism of upper-class politics and antisemitism, to delicate romance, to witty visual humor.  The characterizations are highly original; even those at the extremes of vice and virtue display engaging ideosyncracies.  Most impressive to me was the consistency of Dickens' plot.  Our Mutual Friend was written and published in installments, as was The Count of Monte Cristo.  But Dickens keeps his story on track throughout, never dropping a character, while Dumas' tale is full of gaps and inconsistencies+books
Brilliant!!!!!!+P+I love Due and this was no exception. The Between is powerful, wonderfully written and extremely creative.   In her first novel, Due sets the stage for the consequences of what could happen (both mentally and physically)if you could change your FATE and cheat death. We are introduced to Hilton James, whose memories of his beloved grandmother are haunting and confusing...he sees her dead in their kitchen, only to get help and find her alive and cooking at the stove. Years later, he is still troubled by these memories and seeks professional help from his psychiatist/friend. While attempting to salvage his fragile mind, he is overwhelmed with events that change, memories that are not real (cheating on his wife), and events that did not (in reality it would seem) occur, his wife, a candidate for a judgeship is being threatened by a racist stalker. (There also appears to be a connection between Hilton's powers and the stalkers.) Loving his family and wanting what is best for them, he struggles to maintain his hold of reality. In a novel filled with "parallel worlds, doorways to other dimensions and travelers", Hilton seems to be scared, confused and lonely. What we later learn is that Hilton's grandmother (who rescued him from drowning and lost her life) appears to have suffered from the same type of events...she too appears to have the ability to cheat death. But as they say in Final Destination....you really can't cheat death, and that is why the end of the novel is so powerful. In the end, we see Hilton once again faced with the option to "cheat death" or "succumb" and you should read this powerful, well written novel to see what he finally decides.  +books
Saunders is a genius+P+This is one of the best collections I've read in years--perhaps the best since Civilwarland.  Saunders is an entirely unique voice--there really is no one else like him, and he manages to harness such disparate effects that it kind of leaves you breathless when finished.  You're stunned, sad, and above all laughing+books
Who cares.........+N+I just finished reading this book, complaining the whole way how I did not like it.  I should have put it down, but I thought it had to get better at some point.  There was too much sex (graphic sometimes)and no substance.  While You Were Gone by Sue Miller was better+books
An Excellent Story+P+This book is one of the best I've ever read.  I rarely sit for an entire day to read a book but I just couldn't stop reading.  Mr. Richardson starts by explaining the culture of the Yali tribe, then moves to the life and background of Stan Dale.  Seeing the providence of God at work as the third part brings the Yali tribe and Stan Dale together is remarkable.  Stan Dale's conviction, comittment, and compassion is something to inspire any believer concerned with spreading the Gospel of Jesus Christ+books
Pack it for the plane ride+P+A serial killer's pedophilia leads him to disguise cop-suicides as murders and to toy with the investigators who unexpectedly begin to put together the pieces of his bizarre crime. Connelly alternates between the first-person perspective of the reporter who first suspects that all is not as it seems and the point of view of the murderer. Too much description of the plot will give away its many surprises, which come together in the ingenious final pages of the novel. Suffice it to say that the book offers a potent mix of ingredients that will keep most any reader going: love, sex, death, envy, personal ambition.  All of the things that Connelly does well come together in "The Poet": his ability to craft a complicated plot that nonetheless fits together like clockwork, to build a mood, set a scene, put together a tight workmanlike sentence. Best of all, the book displays his trademark noir hero whose own darkly human qualities make him the right man to locate the monster-killer whose trail he follows here. It's just perfect for the story that Jack McEvoy, the protagonist, is a reporter who stands to benefit from uncovering the crime, and that it's his own good twin who was the original murder victim.  As almost every other reviewer here has mentioned, this book is a class-1 page-turner. I read it in a day while on vacation, never slowing down except to eat. What fun! It's also kind of a kick to see how far we have come in the past ten years from the "cutting-edge" technology that helps investigators solve the crime here (the book was published in 1996). Despite the laptops that McAvoy and others lug around, Jack has to read Edgar Allan Poe's entire corpus during one sleepless night in order to identify the quotations the killer leaves as clues. Today, of course, a "google" search would do the trick in about ten seconds+books
few techniques many examples+N+I am not writing in English and try to learn some fiction writing skills. This book has cited many literay fiction and is a good source for you to find fictions good at dialogue, etc. But it provides very few techniques and you have to read  the referred literature to know how to write a dialogue. I jumped many paragraphs. I also can not agree with the author on what attract the readers. Sometimes I feel the opposite about certain classics. Other books I am reading provide me with many techniques such as Techniques of Selling Writer and Immediate Fiction+books
A well written memoir of the horrors of war.+P+I find it quite interesting the one reader who slams Le Ly is also the only reader in all of these posts who neglected to leave a name or email address. Also the following statement was included "The Viet Congs lied, tortured, and killed numerous innocent people to get what they want." Hmmmm that sounds like the exact same things the Americans did! Also the following statement is made "It's pathetic how low she would go to make a buck off the same capitalist system that she and the communists despised do much that they had to engage in a war that turned many people's lives upside down, to drive the Americans out" That's kinda funny accusing the Vietnamese of starting a war because it's likely there never would have been a war had Americans stayed in America. The Vietcong were no more worse human beings than the Americans they were fighting against. The Vietcong were true patriots no different than American patriots and visitors to Vietnam today will find many ex-Vietcong are friendly and civil to American visitors. A good book with one more account of how innocent people are effected by the war+books
The book on intelligence operations during World War II+P+This is an extremely detailed book on Allied (mainly British) deception operations during World War II. While it was written in 1976 it still hold up well, though some new information on the role of GCHQ and signals intelligence has been released since 1976. I am still amazed at the scope of operations the British ran during World War II. A very well written book, though it is by know means a quick read. It took me almost a month to get through it. If you are keenly interested in intelligence operations try to track down this book+books
Good for stupid people.+N+This is a wonderful book for those kids who either have parents paying off all their teachers to pass them or the students that sleep with the right people to pass. Oh, and I don't sit in my room on Saturdays playing card games, either. But having fun doesn't mean "get drunk 24/7 for four years". There's something called HAVING A LIFE that this book totally misses but, well, it's for college kids, and they're mostly idiots+books
THE CHOCOLATEY BOOK EVER!!!+P+*FLASHING LIGHTS*   Roald Dahl dose it again! This is an amazing story. It's about a bot named Charlie, who is pretty poor. Even though he is poor he learns how to have fun, and not ask for much. There's one thing he want's, a golden ticket.As soon as you start this book you will hope the best for Charlie ,and you won't want to put it down.                       +books
This didn't make me happy+N+- Its hard to be emphathetic towards a protagonist who's depressed and decides to have an affair when she already has a great husband, two healthy children and no financial worries.  Two stars because the addition of the "history of happiness" (research for a book she is writing) was interesting.+books
Inspiring. It will transform your therapy practice.+P+Milne,a 3rd generation Scottish osteopath, has the celtic gift of healing through word and touch. He shares the long multi-cultural history, precise techniques and profound implications of cranial work with quiet passion and  reverence. His approach is an extraordinary blend of clinical expertise and  spiritual authenticity. A must for any therapist using this approach+books
Misinterperation of JIHAD+N+First of all, I think that anyone out there who is writing books about anti islam are just out there to make money. I would like to go back to what the author stated about the muslim world dictators. The question is who put them in power to eliminate the true values of Islam? Why today Middle East is the target by the oppressors of the New World Order? Who puts these leaders in throne and try to bring Democracy to a muslim world. What would happen if Islamic constitution would establish in western world. It would be a scary scene for that part of the world. Those who are muslims or studied Islam knows that it is a religion of PEACE. The word JIHAD in Islam corresponds to fighting against the DEVIL who resides within all of us which is 90% of JIHAD and the other 10% of JIHAD is self defence. There is no conflict among any religion branch except those power hungry dictators. Comon people lets not have a religious war, we are all the children of ADAM and beleive in ONE GOD. Let us all join together to fight the DEVIL who is here to destroy each individual of us. We must all wake up before it is too late and see what the soldiers of DEVIL are doing to bring ONE WORLD ORDER and to enslave us under the DEVIL government. Peace to you all+books
Drunks drug addict dying son = one dysfunctional family.+N+Eugene O'Neill may have been the father of American theatre, but the excellent writing he became known for is not portrayed in Long Day's Journey into Night. O'Neill's characters were shallow, pathetic and seemed to have great moodswings.The father-son relationship between James Tyrone and his son, Jamie, is meanspirited, and they tend to blame eachother for the family problems. Tyrone regularly refers to Jamie as a useless failure, and a drunk, not only to his face but to other family members, and in turn Jamie refers to his father as a man who would rather save a dime then save the life of his son, Edmund. Tyrone says such things as "You'd be content to sit back like a lazy lunk and sponge on me for the rest of your life!"(p.32) and comments to Edmund that, "If he's ever had a loftier dream than whores and whiskey, he's never shown it."(p.131). The characters of the parents are pathetic, the mother all fluttery and drugged, and the father as the stereotypical old, cheap, and mean failed celebrity. The only seemingly normal relationship is between Edmund and Jamie as for the most part they exchange brotherly love. The relationships and conversations between the family members seems entirely unnatural, they go from scathingly angry to chipper in a matter of seconds. It is as if they entire family is bipolar.  Long Day's Journey into Night was based on the life of O'Neill himself, with the character of Edmund as O'Neill. The mother of O'Neill was truly a drug addict who had lost the son between O'Neill and his older brother, and his father never accepted O'Neill for who he was. These sad beginnings continued throughout the life of O'Neill and was evident in the writing of this piece. If the characters in Long Day's Journey into Night are closely based on his family members then O'Neill had a more sad life than anyone could possibly imagine+books
A book that stands out among good books!+P+As a big military history reader I have to say this book was excellent.  I don't recommend very many books but this was great especially for people already familiar with WWII.  It takes you inside the dfeat of the German Army.  Very great observations from high ranking German officer mixed with views from the foot soldier.  Gives a great perspective on the German Army and the internal divisions it had+books
One of Better of the Chris Hart books...+P+I have come to the conclusion that the more CARTOONY/FUNNY PAGES Books by Chris Hart  are best written, clearly explained and  better informed.  This book is great to get a GOOD feel for the 60's retro Hanna Barbera/ Pink Panther Cool McCool [giving away my age!!!] style of cartoons.  The part about creating your on style and constructing heads/ bodies is good. The part on showing emotion is well thought out.  As mentioned before; the other books that deal w/ Manga/Mechas, etc are NOT that clear in terms of  expalaining content/ process; but the more HUMEROUS books are.+books
Cat's Cradle - Vonnegut's Absurd Masterpiece+P+Kurt Vonnegut's "Cat's Cradle" is the story of a man, Jonah, who is writing about the "end of the world," or the day when the atom bomb was dropped.  His work on the book encourages him to go on many journeys which ultimately leave him in a somewhat ironic yet very comedic position.  The story features an imaginative religion, a scientific potion, and a far off society as part of Vonnegut's many bizarre episodes.  Jonah, researches the "father of the atom bomb" and his children in order to determine what they were doing on the day the atom bomb was dropped.  Seemingly against his will, Jonah gets pulled into a plethora of discoveries about the children and their father which he never could have imagined to be true.  His journeys ultimately land him, along with the children, on a secluded island with a radically different society from their own.  I did in fact enjoy reading this book because of the absurdity and the unbelievable voyages which the main character undergoes.  However, it is in fact Vonnegut's style that makes the book so enjoyable.  He is able to bring the reader into this world where virtually anything can happen which then leaves the reader totally unaware and clueless as to what comes next.  The world allows him to describe such things as the discovery of the island of San Lorenzo in a two page account where six different countries claim and forget about the nation before escaping African slaves finally claims the land for good.  It is through Vonnegut's voice and style that the reader may not stop to consider such oddities as this one.  Originally, I chose to read this book after finishing Vonnegut's "Slaughterhouse Five," and was absolutely taken away by the combination of absurdity and hilariousness through which he expresses himself in this book.  Though I did not expect this book to be as far out as the alien adventure in "Slaughterhouse Five," it did seem like a pleasant offbeat satire about modern man.  In the end I enjoyed this book more than "Slaughterhouse Five" because of the comedic voice that I found more visible in "Cat's Cradle."  Though the first was rather ridiculous and interesting, for me it did nothing more than provoke thoughts about where such an idea would come from, rather than make me laugh.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is seeking an imaginative and far off satirical story that is sure to create a smile.  While many may think the story to be boring and pointless, it is partly this hollowness that makes it so enjoyable.  The reader is baffled and unable to understand why things happen the way they do creating a randomness that I have found to be attractive.  For those readers that were bored by part of the book and decided to put it down forever, I would encourage you to fight through the beginning.  After all, I did in fact at first believe that this would be a serious account of the day the atom bomb was dropped, until the Bokonon religion was further explained and glorified+books
Even Better than the Four Agreements!+P+"Prayers" is even a better book than the Four Agreements, though the Four Agreements build you a foundation.  It is meant to be a book we will read when at the quest of love and peace.  The book is meant to be read when you are angry, sad, experiencing fear and judgment.  Of course you still need to find other ways to work on your anger, this book simply have the power to help you let go of those nasty thoughts.  This book is not meant to be used to suppress/deny the existence of anger and fear, for, we need to accept human has all ranges of emotions.  There is no right and wrong for whatever and however we feel things.  At the end of the day, we are just saying prayers to let go of the emotional poisons.  That is the essence of this book.  The words of the book can only be experienced and felt.  You cannot use your judgmental mind to think and to understand nor can you try to rush finishing the book.  Some books, for example this one, just are not meant for speed reading because you cannot experience the peace the author wants to give you.  When you open your heart and feel the power of the words, you experience lots of love and compassion to yourself and others.  That is how you want to use this book to open your spiritual eyes and stay there.  This book is easy to understand.  It is meant to be read again and again, especially during turbulent times where we are most easily to slip back to the judgmental self.  I definitely recommend this book to someone who is experiencing some sort of a significant loss in life (whether it is a loved one's death, a lost of job or a loss of marriage).  May we all come out from the turbulent times and experience love and care, which help us return to our authentic self - with love and care and without judgment about self and others+books
A new approach to female relationships+P+I asked for this book because I thought it would give advice on how to raise daughters--it does--and more.  Dr. Northrup begins by explaining how mothers and daughters are connected through the generations, and how we can only create a healthy relationship with our daughter when we heal our relationship with our mother.  As we heal ourselves, we heal all the women who have gone on before us.  This is only a sample of some of the insight she offers into our relationships as women.  I'll admit I was surprised by the holistic approach she takes,  but am glad she offers that insight, as I'm only vaguely familiar with some of the ideas/theories and believe I have more to grow in that area.    Rather than a book geared towards raising children (I've read my share--and I thought that's what this book would be) I would categorize this book as a self-help book geared toward strengthening and creating a healthy relationship with your mother and daughter.  Very pleased with everything I've read+books
Get the Swatter!+N+This book does start with some slight promise. It has a touching opening chapter. And it follows the life story of one of its villains, who is a very unlikely, over-the-top character, but who nevertheless will probably win your sympathy and may even break your heart. The book also has plenty of Cornwell's trademark technical detail. You will be treated to a wide variety of how-to tips on everything from how to fly a helicopter, to what gun to carry for different law enforcement jobs, to how to identify watermarks on paper.   But overall, I found this book to be a big disappointment. First of all, the book is riddled with egomania. Almost every chapter contains some lavish adulation of the protagonist, Kate Scarpetta. Almost every character oozes adoration of Scarpetta, lives only to win her respect, longs for her, even in planning to kill her seeks only to unite with her in ecstasy. What's all this about? Since Scarpetta is so clearly Cornwell's alterego, a reader can only conclude that Cornwell herself is getting lost in a cult of personality.  However, Scarpetta doesn't appear much in person in this book. She remains a presence, inspiring others. When she does make a personal appearance though, the book's tone of adoration doesn't mute into any more seemly modesty, as would seem appropriate when an author is in essence describing herself. If anything, the deification of Scarpetta intensifies in these scenes. For example, a man observing her, notes how deliberately she does everything. Even in the act of reaching for her coffee cup, he sees her "exuding confidence and power." Really, all this reverence for Scarpetta turns these pages into absurdity.  Even apart from their hero worship of Scarpetta though, many of the other characters in the book are manifestly improbable, or even impossible. A book could perhaps stand one over-the-top villain, such as the bizarrely afflicted one I mentioned in the first paragraph of this review. However, most of the characters in Blowfly, evildoers and presumed good guys alike, are leading lives of such mythic proportions, that the book loses all touch with reality. Scarpetta's niece, who has been an on-going character in Cornwell's books, turns into a full-blown cartoon superheroine here, with preternatural command and capabilities across international borders. One of the actions this niece involves herself with in this book is so outrageous and of such questionable morality, that this subplot would seem more appropriate as back-story for a Nintendo game.   There are also specific stylistic problems with the book. Cornwell has often used the technique of short chapters, snapshots of sorts, interlacing the actions of the different characters. The technique can be a valid one, building suspense while you are briefly diverted from one character's pending homicide, to the less crucial actions of some subsidiary player. And the technique can be used like a mosaic, to build a picture tile-by-tile. But with Blowfly, the chapters have become so short that it seems a mere pandering to readers' presumed short attention spans. I'll admit the TV ad pace of the book kept me going through to the end. Snap. Snap. Snap. Now this. Now the other. But I'm not proud of my growing addiction to this kind of hit-and-run narration.   Then there's the persistent, occasionally jarring use of the present tense - in a context in which this couldn't all possibly be happening in real time. And there are too many ongoing, hackneyed analogies between the brain and various machines. Cornwell has always liked these comparisons, but they become constant pebbles in the shoe here. "No frontal lobe alarm sounds" rang... "...her brain can't process"... "jerking her mind out of gear"...   Finally, there is the problem with the book's ending.  It's as if Cornwell ran out of paper, or else was ordered by her publisher to simply turn in her manuscript, finished or not. All her knowledge of CSI investigative technique count for nothing in the end. None of the plot threads get really integrated into coherence.  So there are a few good things about Blowfly. You get to inhabit another serial killer's mind and daily squalid living conditions with creepy intimacy. There are also some interesting psychological insights into the motives of female accomplices or "enablers" of such men. There are things to be learned about defense weapons. But these good things get swamped, like the dead bodies that fall into the bayous of Baton Rouge where much of this book's action takes place. Overall, I'd say if you see this Blowfly coming your way - get out the flyswatter!+books
Not worth the money.+N+Before embarking on a 2 month trip to Italy a friend let me borrow Rick Steve's guide and said that it was better. I was skeptical but took the book anyway figuring it might come in handy on such a long trip. She was right. Rick Steve's organizes information in a much clearer and more intuitive way. This comes in handy when you're standing in a busy square, you haven't eaten all day and everything you've tried so far has been a jip and you just want someone to tell you where you can find a good deal. Flipping through Lonely Planet you might think you've been handed a manual on how to overhaul an engine - overloaded with information poorly organized. Rick Steve's book on the other hand is a breath of fresh air or, to put it more tritely, a helping hand. Not to mention that his guides have a personal touch and some of Rick Steve's own character sewn into them. After some time you really get the sense that he's there with you, helping you along (- now isn't that sweet!).+books
Is he even writing anymore????+N+After reading his last few book with "co-authors" I wonder if he is even writing at all or are all the sub-par novels being churned out under his name coming straight from the "co-author". I have been a fan of Mr. Patterson since my first Alex Cross novel almost 10 years ago. While I still enjoy the Cross books, I find them more and more out of character as each new book comes out. Alex-vs- the vampire cult??? Kyle Craig a serial killer??? Alex joins the FBI??? Give me a break. I can only hope from the description of Cross X the series jumps back over the shark and gets back the glory it deserves+books
Great starter cookbook and great for snacks+P+I bought this book after seeing another book by Raab at a friends house.  I bought a copy for our home so that my then teenagers could have a simple easy to use cookbook . It has good basic food that appeals to teens and young adults. It tells how to stock a pantry, tools you will need and other helpful hints about keeping your kitchen clean and operating kitchen appliances. It even has soup recipes, pizza,meatballs,hummus, cookies and many more yummy recipes.  I was going to send this to my son who is away from home for two years serving a church mission but, I couldn't bear to part with it so I sent him his own copy. Another great book by Raab is "The Clueless Vegetarian" Well worth the price!!! A+books
Same as before+N+Why should I review this book only to have it rejected? ? My review of the first Trudeau book was rejected because I referred to the author. Many other reviews referred to the author more than I did.  Robert Morrisett+books
Falls Flat of Its Potential+N+Elmore Leonard is one of the more respected of popular contemporary authors, and deservingly so.  He has a wonderful ear for dialogue and the impressive ability to both generate plot and develop characters through it.  What many authors may describe in several paragraphs or pages, Leonard does in a few lines of dialogue.  As such, his books are tremendously quick and enjoyable reads.  However, 'Be Cool' is not one of his best.  The concept is interesting enough: a sequel.  And not just that, but a sort of metafictional work poking fun at the whole idea of sequels.  Chili Palmer returns, trying to get his foot in the door of the music industry.  As always, the protagonist is surrounded by an odd assortment of hitmen, cons, and scattered goofballs.  However, when reading 'Be Cool' I couldn't shake the feeling that the book was rushed.  Many of the character (the cop, the gangsta rapper) are scarcely developed at all (the latter, in particular, could have been a rich source of satire).  Also, the ending seemed rushed, as well.  Leonard seemed to be racing towards it without building up much tension.  The reader reaches the last page and wonders what was the point of the second half of the book.  I'd always recommend Elmore Leonard as a quick, enjoyable, "beach" read.  However, go with something else of his instead of 'Be Cool.+books
Sad But Thought Provoking...Good Read+P+I had never read anything by Anna Quindlen before so this was my first book.  I will be picking up more of her books as she proves to be a good author.  The story was on an excellent subject although it did jump back and forth quite a bit.  I am married and have never been in a situation like this character but the author easily made you feel the panic, fear and heart wrenching decision making in a way that made you understand the subject matter at hand with a more attentiveness to the real world. +books
Talk to your doctor instead of wasting $ on this book+N+This book does nothing but help the author make a quick buck by playing on people's fears.  I *am* a believer in the importance of lowering your bad cholesterol, but I think the way to do it is to talk to your doctor (hopefully you have a good doctor) who can monitor your progress and guide you through the process.  This book has some "common sense" information but also a lot if misinformation, such as the stuff on supplements.  None of them has been shown to really work!  Don't waste your money.  Talk to your doctor first, and be sure to find out if your parents also have high cholesterols and let your doctor know+books
I'm a big Margaret Coel fan +P+I find life among the Arapaho as she describes it infinitely fascinating, and wish she would spend more time on that than she does.  She's very good in her description of the setting, also, and I can easily imagine myself on the Wyoming Reservation.  This is the umpteenth book in the series (10th?) in which a Jesuit priest (who is with the St. Francis Mission) and his friend, an Arapaho attorney, solve mysteries on the reservation.  The plot in this series is two-fold (turn of the 20th century and early 21st century) and revolves around an old photograph by Curtis on display in the mission's museum.  The photo depicts a staged attack on a phony Arapaho village.  In the course of shooting that photo, a woman was killed, so some chapters describe the events around this historic murder, while others describe some present day crimes that appear to be linked to the Curtis photographs in some way.  A woman is murdered and her husband is the chief suspect, but on the same night, the newly-hired curator at the museum disappears.  Then there's the visit from the Senator who may be declaring himself as a candidate for President -- how does that tie in?  Coel is an excellent writer, although she makes some blunders that a fact-checker or good editor could help her with.  Like all the other states, for example, Wyoming has two senators, not a sole representative in Washington, and it is highly unlikely that a person who has only been curator for a month would have had time to mount an exhibition, particularly one that involves borrowing materials from another collection.  These things take years, not weeks.    So -- I think perhaps Ms. Coel is under pressure to keep turning these best-selling books out and that's a pity, because this is quite a good book in other respects.  Coel is a great story teller.  I'm also happy to see that the unrequited love theme between the priest and the lawyer is being downplayed+books
Cover design misleading...+N+Call me shallow, but, from the cover of this book (a whimsical, illustration with an equally whimsical font), I thought, being unfamiliar with this author, that I was in for an Anna Maxted/Shannon Olsen type of read. (Sorry if I spelled the last names wrong). I do like reading novels of substance, but I felt that the cover design on this novel completely misrepresented the content. I am disappointed. I am (substance or not) perplexed by the novel's structure and not too interested in the gazillion characters presented (there are too many for my taste!). Also, I felt like the fact that Nora kept commenting on the fact that there were &quot;too many characters&quot; and &quot;no plot&quot; in the protagonist's stories were just excuses for putting in too many characters and failing to develop a plot. It's probably just all way over my head. I can tell the author is talented, it's just not my speed+books
Just About Perfect+P+Written in 1948, this engrossing tale of a group of misplaced wartime Brits in a poor backwater in West Africa touches on so many human qualities that it is a chronicle of our mortality. Foremost is the perfectly presented portrait of a marriage that has turned into a lie for both Henry Scobie, the honest policeman of this coastal town, and his "literary" wife, Louise, who has become the object of pity and contempt for all the frustrated local British "club" members who constantly mind one another's business. Scobie no longer loves his wife but can't bring himself to hurting her. He simply pities her. And Louise no longer loves Henry and wants desperately to escape from West Africa, especially when she finds out that her "Ticki" has been passed up for promotion to Commissioner. The atmosphere becomes dark and twisted as a young man, Wilson, appears on the scene and, in his youthful stupidity, falls in love with Louise while he conducts secret investigations on British authorities suspected of aiding in the smuggling of industrial diamonds through Africa to Germany. Scobie is one of those suspects. A marvelously film noir portrait of a corrupt Syrian merchant, Yusef, is thrown into the mix. I can see Sidney Greenstreet doing this part to perfection in a screen adaptation. Add jealousy, desperation, a contrast of honesty and lies, sex, and the tortured feelings of a deeply religious man and you have most of what this novel contains. O yes, and then, as always, there's the brilliant writing of Graham Greene, his wonderful metaphors, crystal clear descriptions, and fantastic insights into the crabbed and self-defeating thought processes of his characters. All this equals a modern classic. My only complaint is a bit of redundancy and pedantry regarding Catholicism, a religion I cannot stomach anymore, and my personal disbelief that someone like Scobie can take Catholicism so seriously. But this is my own thing. Greene remains brilliant, original, and indeed, "the ultimate chronicler of twentieth-century man's consciousness and anxiety," or at least one of the top five+books
Sets the standard for hard sci-fi+P+Astronomers detect a large object entering the Solar system from deep space.  At first it is thought to be just another large rock, but scientists soon discover that it is actually a colossal space ship called Rama.  A team of scientists blast off from Earth to investigate in a ship called the Endeavor.  What follows is a story of exploration, and one of the best conceived hard sci-fi tales ever written.  Who built Rama?  What is it's purpose?  Why did it come to our solar system?  The story follows the progress of the astronauts/scientists in the not too distant future as they methodically explore the unknown space ship.  Each new discovery brings new surprises as well.  This is also a political tale as well as factions on the ship and on Earth have very different ideas about what Rama is, what is represents, and what should be done.  This book is, in my opinion, one of the most intelligent and well thought-out hard sci-fi novels ever written.  First published in 1973, it remains as fresh as if it were written today.  There are several things that I really like about this novel.  First, the exploration of Rama by the crew of the Endeavor proceeds in an organized and intelligent manner by men and women who are not superhuman. Discoveries are assimilated, risks are weighed, and the plan evolves.  One common problem with this sub-genre of sci-fi (particularly when transfered to TV) is that individuals of superhuman stature (e.g. the main character has a Ph.D. in astrophysics, was in the Special Forces, a fighter pilot, and in their spare time a classically trained French chef, a lyric poet, and fluent in ten languages) go off on their own to make brilliant discoveries while narrowly avoiding death.  This may add drama to the plot, but this cheapens the story and moves the entire story from believable to fantastic.  The characters, while perhaps representing some of the best and brightest of humanity, are not absurdly talented beyond reason.  Second, Rama itself is fascinating.  Clarke constructed a rich world for his intrepid adventures to explore.  Finally, there is a sense of wonder or awe associated with the exploration of Rama that many have tried to duplicate, but none have even come remotely close to succeeding.  This book has `atmosphere'.  Early in the novel Clarke analogizes the exploration of Rama with the opening of Tutankhamen's tomb.  There is something wonderful and mysterious about Rama that goes far beyond current human understanding, but understandable by humans nonetheless by scientific analysis and reflection.  It is this last aspect that really makes this novel better than 2001.  In the latter novel, the aliens are so advanced that they are utterly incomprehensible.  In Rama, the alien technology can be understood by homo sapiens.  If I had any complaint at all, the novel is a bit short by modern standards.  It really seems light at about 240 pages, and it would have been nice if Clarke had further developed several of the story lines.  In any case, this is a book that can be read over and over again.  There are VERY few books that I read a second time, but this has been one of them.  In the end, there are more questions than answers, and many of the questions are not resolved.  I have not read any of the sequels because I heard they are really bad and I don't want to spoil this novel.  This is one of the novels that put Clarke into the great three of sci-fi (with Heinlein and Asimov), and it won both the Hugo and the Nebula award.  This novel really defines and/or sets the standard for the sci-fi sub-genre of exploration/interstellar archaeology+books
A must-read+P+This is, without doubt, the most incredible book I have ever read. It may completely change your opinions on foreign policy or may reinforce what you already believe, but it is sure to generate some response and some discussion. Sharansky respectfully tells it like it is: when politicians have been wrong, why they've been wrong, and what they should have done differently. His governmental criticism transcends party lines, and even Sharansky himself, a Jew and a member of numerous Israeli cabinets, says that a Palestinian state is the only way Israel will have peace. This book is everything you'd expect with everything you wouldn't - read it+books
Ponderous reading!+N+This  is one extremely ponderous book to read.  The author makes several well intentioned points, only to get bogged down in his own research and wordiness.  Read it if you must....be sure you have lots of time to decipher it once you have+books
Loved this book+P+Even though I'm not selling my house, I got some good tips for making my house look bigger and brighter.  Only downside is that some of the pictures are small on the page so it's hard to see the details of what they're talking about in the text.  Overall, you get the idea, though.+books
Weak but worth a look+N+Hope Edelman's book is successfully part memoir and part academic study. She has chosen a narrow scope for her research, and that's fine--that is, until she feels the need to dismiss other related topics (such as the equally intimate bond between granddaughters and paternal grandmothers) by claiming that they are just not as significant instead of acknowledging that she simply did not choose to research them. The second hole in Edelman's research comes when she refers to how maternal grandmothers live longer than paternal ones--where the basis for this statement? I'll believe it when I see it. It's absolutely fine for her to choose to focus specifically on mother to mother to daughther generational relationships; what's not fine is for her to casually brush off related relationships as though they just don't matter as much. Within the context of her thesis, they are not as significant, but this is something that Edelman needs to address instead of pretending that she didn't write about them because they are not as significant. Other than these two crucial holes, Edelman's book holds merit in its well-written accounts of family, both from her own life and from her case studies. It's worth a read, not so much for its actual insights, but perhaps for the insight that it inspires its readers to pursue on their own+books
Tedious+N+The subtitle of this book, The Lives and Films of Akira Kurosawa, is completely deceitful.  There is nothing biographical in this book about either one of its main protagonists.  It is rather a chronicle of the Japanese film industry, not without interest in itself.  However, the voluminous facts, tid-bits of information about every minor actor, director, script-writer, and film composer, as well as the synopsis of every film mentioned, makes for increbibly tedious reading.  While the book has its merit as a source of information, not much credit should be given to the author other than for his ability to put together facts that are available from a number of sources.  Meanwhile, reading all these capsules of data will leave you dry when it comes to the lives of Kurosawa and Mifune.  The author tells us nothing about how they lived, felt, thought, behaved,what motivated them; probably because he doesn't know himself.  A simple gathering of public facts, none researched by the author himself because their sources are many and widely available, especially on the internet, do not make for a worthy book+books
Too easy+N+While containing a number of intersting plans for small homes, this book falls short on several accounds.  First, there is almost no text save what is on the inside of the jacket.  That's right: no introduction, no methodology.  There is no explanation of which competitions the plans were taken from or what awards they won. (Amusingly, I went to show my neighbor one of the plans that I liked.  He said he liked it too but that it was an old plan from a competition in the early 90's. And would you believe that he happened to have a copy of the competition from which the plan was taken!)     Secondly, as to the plans themselves, dimensions are rarely marked and often unclearly.  In the case of two or three of the plans this makes them nearly unintelligable.   The lack of wall sections or descriptions of materials used for the majority of the plans makes it impossible to understand the particulars of what makes the houses energy effecient.   In short, the book far from lives up to its description and isn't worth spending the money for a handful of plans since a person can look at plans all day long for free online.  +books
Very helpful+P+Not only did this book have many helpful pointers and much concrete information, it was written in a direct and funny manner.  I'd recommend it, even if I don't know if it will lead to a breakout novel for me (yet!)+books
The bad boys are good!+P+I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  If you've read as many mountaineering books as I have, eventually you may read a dozen accounts of the same epic mountaineering tragedy.  Even if I'd heard the story before I was enchanted with the Burgess viewpoint.  I also encountered some of the tales about the twins' antics in other books.  And I was delighted to hear them tell their own stories.  Their respect for the local people and customs was very important to me.   It's a much better world with the Burgess twins in it!  Thanks for sharing your stories with the rest of us+books
Capable but strange+N+Gives many examples of Weapons, most of which are useful. Gives no/few examples of Rings/Armours/Rods/Staffs/Shields  Doesn't really think out a lot of the bonuses, also I question a lot of the penalties one has to take to use a Legacy weapon. About the only table worth taking is 4-1, or 4-2. Sure its a minus three to your saves, and a minus 2 to your attack power, and a whole SLEW of HP. The rest of them are so painful they aren't worth taking.   Also all the caster "Tables" the ones your suppost to use if your a caster but losing caster levels and spell slots left and right doesn't make any sense. No matter what feats and wizardry skills its not worth it. Those could have been more thought out.  Also I question the fact that in some cases the lowest tables, A, D, and G. Seem to be a lot better than the B, E and H tables just from the way they interact with things. I do fully agree that the top end capability you can add to your Legacy item is quite powerful, the I table is filled with many useful things the you wish you could have picked two of them. What I wish/want was if they're was some way to trade lower level slots to get you the capacity to get two I table skills. Also some way to get either more or less slots if you take a less dangerous or more dangerous tables of the legacy grid.  The rules for weapons and fighters/barbarians/paladins/rangers. Are very well thought out and are very powerful. Yet for anyone other class they need heavy modification to be workable. In a Caster heavy campaign like the one I run and participate in its a very low value book+books
Boring Narrator+N+I have heard so much of this book and decided to get the audio CDs from the library. I was extremely disappointed with the narrator - who also happens to be the author. He sounds as if he is about to fall asleep and seems to have trouble annunciating words that end in "w" - it drives me mad. He reads in a monotone - no excitement in his voice - he just drones on and on.   I am a big fan of audio CDs because I can listen to the stories while doing other things - I'm not tied down to the couch. I have listened to many narrators - Jim Dale for one - and have never hated listening until now. Charles Frazier may be a "brilliant" author, and should stick with writing - period! Leave the storytelling to someone who has a personality and brings the story to life+books
A good book but like most heinlein's books+P+to surmise, the book is about an actor who is hired to be a political figure.  I will not reveal any more as to not ruin the nature of the plot. I felt that like some of heinlein's books, the book is plauged with  politics, less science fiction, the only sci-fi thing about it is that the plot takes place in space, other than that, it's all politics. Same thing with Citizen of the galaxy, a book that starts off really well and ending with a theme that do not portray sci-fi rather it shows heinlein's knowledge in law.  I felt that the book could have been much better and i don't see how it won the Hugo award. Conclusion: The book is a fun pass, but nothing more. don't expect any groundbreaking plot, or jaw dropping plot twists, just your old fashioned politicians-dear-diary+books
the best poete maudit!+P+Reading a poem by Baudelaire is like sipping chardonnay on the quayside in Paris. Formidable! I always return to this book, and I buy as many translations of it as I can. This one I think is the best. As a poet, Baudelaire was the master of describing the "dark regions" of the human soul. He was the Edgar Allan Poe of poetry.+books
He should change his name to Dinesh Conrad!+N+This is an appaling book, spouting the kind of Africophobism that genocidist writers like Conrad and Haggard did many years ago. This man is a stooge. Avoid at all costs+books
The Old Feint and Switch+N+So you pick up this book and read on the back cover the exciting quote about Hemingway's ghost and you're ready to drop some cash, right?  Guess what--there's zero information about the Hemingway haunting in this book!  In addition, old Ataulfo of Madrid has less words wasted on him than an asthmatic's version of Handel's Halleluja Chorus.  Instead, what's offered here is a rehash of old stories (and old theories about what ghosts could be) with insipid, comic book illustrations.  Why this is called a &quot;field guide&quot; with its connotation of an exhaustive reference to every kind of manifestation of a particular phenomenon--be it birds, plants, or mushrooms--is yet another part of the mystery of why this book exists.  If you're a serious researcher of this subject, then pass this book up and seek Hem's fetch elsewhere+books
Where's the story...?+N+The theme is interesting enough - an American inmate of a British lunatic asylum contributes much to the creation of OED.  Unfortunately the book doesn't have much beyond the outline of the theme.  As some other reviewers have noted, it would have made a decent magazine article, but instead it is filled out to book length with repetition, semi relevant trivia, and melodramatic hyperbole of the "superior" Victorian English kind+books
popular ... but why?+N+After completing my first year of law school, I really wonder why so many professors use this textbook.  More than half the people I spoke with in my class thought the casebook's usability was poor or worse.   Property is not a difficult class, aside from future estates and related issues (Rule Against Perpetuities).  The hardest thing about property is knowing the jurisdictional views on various aspects of property law, and this casebook does only an OK job highlighting that.  It is basically a lot of memorization and the learning of that material could have been substantially aided by organizing the book differently.  Additionally, many of its cases are not sufficiently edited, thereby necessitating that one read through too much irrelevant information to get to the legal issue.  My other case books are much more balanced on this issue.    As a last note, the production quality is lower than what I would expect for its price.  The paper chosen and the fair reproduction of what photos exist in the book contrast strongly with its price.    I suppose this sounds like a laundry list of complaints, but the book compares poorly to my other casebooks, simply stated+books
How Annoying+N+This book is divided into chapters with different religio-social related themes such as "God", "money", "Power", "Love" etc. For each theme, the author presents a few movies relating to it. It didn't take long to realize that Higgins is a liberal Christian who seems more concerned with political ideologies than the salvation of souls. The values promoted are Christian to a degree but only those that overlap with modern liberalism.   Higgins got annoying fast by constantly criticizing the Church (which I think he means Evangelical Christians) though he doesn't name names. And the reason for the criticism is that they don't uphold the 'true message' of Christianity which is that even more annoying buzz word 'social justice' and liberal ethics in general. Higgins uses the typical method of judging the 'Church' for judging other's behaviors as sinful.   The subtitle "Finding Spiritual Fingerprints in Culturally Significant Films" itself is somewhat disturbing. The movie industry is the last place we should hope to find much true spirituality. It is overridden with everything contrary to Christianity. Saying that some of these movies have the fingerprints of God (I know he doesn't actually say that, but its implied) is to overlook the other prevalent messages in these movies that are ungodly to the core. Even a small amount of arsenic in a glass of water is deadly. So even though I do watch movies, I am very cautious to see much holiness in them.   For as much as I didn't like the book, it did introduce me to some new movies which I have now watched and enjoyed.+books
A Forgotten Past+P+Nelson George's arguments are clear, well-organized, and powerful. While reading, I was forced to look at things differently than I ever had before. The ideological vision of integration is an honorable one, but the simple  fact demonstrated in The Death of Rhythm &amp; Blues is that integration is  forever indebted to black utility for white profit. It is likely that race  relations in this country would be quite different if whites had not  benefited from the talent and ingenuity of black athletes and performers in  such a profitable fashion. This is ground that history teachers rarely, if  ever, tread on. It is quite tragic to know that the unique and powerful  black culture from which basically all popular music is derived, can be so  easily forgotten or ignored. George's position is most intriguing in that  it reminded me that history may belong to the teller, but there are many  stories to be told. I consider myself fortunate to have heard this one+books
Very disappointing+N+Bought this book to look up some very old records that my folks had. Maybe 1 out of 50 is listed. This book is a piece of doodoo+books
This book is bad+N+This won a pulitzer for reasons I don't understand.  Maybe it's because I'm not sophisticated enough, but after reading Gunter Grass I'm starting to think literary awards are given out on the basis of how regular and detailed the physical descriptions of male genitalia and its veins are in the book.  This is a leaving Las Vegas style story about a guy who decides to drink himself to death.  The only problem is he's lived his whole life and settled in to die by a quarter of the way through the book.  This book gives you empathy with the main character not by putting you in his skin through skilled storytelling, but by boring you to the point you yourself know what it's like to want to die.  This book seems mainly to be loved by those who deem it a mark of sophistication to like things most people find offensive.  Sex, foul language, crude descriptions - they're all fine as a means to an end but this books parades them for no literary purpose I can detect.  This book has interesting elements, but it's bad+books
Pass+N+If you're new to the postmodernism question, then this book isn't for you. Better to start someplace else. And if you been looking at postmodernism for a while now, you've probably already read other, more extensive works by the authors of this volume, so you don't need to read this book either. So basically, there's no good reason to read this book.  And if you were going to read it, you would have a hard time because of the way its laid out design-wise. Being postmodern and all, Zondervan tried to design the inside of this book as "with-it" as they could. Unfortunately, while I enjoy postmodern book covers, when that same style is applied to the insides of a book it can make for some very tedious reading. Much of the text is printed as a light shade of gray using an italic font, which, as any graphic designer reading this review will tell you, is a big no-no. It just makes for hard reading.  Oh, and future editions of this work should edit out Fredica Mathewes-Green's attemps at humorous commentary throughout Horton's piece.  Cheers+books
Misses the Point+N+After using Dr.Dyer's aaah meditation CD for a month, I decided that I wanted to learn more this meditation. Therefore, I bought the book Manifest Your Destiny.  The book reads like a personal journal about nine insights he has gained from his own search for spiritualism.  There are many things that disturb me about this book.        Dr. Dyer cites quotes from the bible to substantiate some of his points without citing the book, chapter, or verse.  One of the bible quotes he uses is "Is it not written in your law `I have said, You are gods?'" (John 10:34)  This is the passage to which Jesus referred when He said this to the Pharisees who were attempting to charge Him with blasphemy: " God standeth in the congregation of God; He judgeth among the gods. How long will ye judge unjustly, And respect the persons of the wicked? ... I said, Ye are gods, And all of you sons of the Most High."  (Psalms 82:1,2,6). The unjust judges of Israel (i.e., the Pharisees) were the subject of these verses.  They were civil magistrates because of their authority and power; and, they represented divine majesty in the government of the twelve tribes of Israel.  Dr. Dyer uses this verse completely out of context.   Scripture cannot be broken.        Jesus believed in the bible because it is infallible and immutable as are God's other laws.  A true seeker of spiritualism cannot reconfigure God's Word for his own purpose.  Neither can the true spiritual seeker be ignorant about God's Word and actually expect to know God's and come into a relationship with Him.  Dr. Dyer takes a little bit of truth and expands upon it in a somewhat convincing way to fit our desire for an easy road to spiritualism. The fact of the matter is that according to Jesus the door to God's kingdom is narrow (Luke 13:24).   There are no shortcuts.       Lastly, a true spiritual seeker does not strive to become spiritual with the intention of manifesting worldly possessions.  This appears to be a main theme of Dr. Dyer's book.  Those who seek God first gain all they need to be happy in this world as a "gift" from Him.  We do not need to grasp at anything as long as we trust God and put Him first in our lives.  Dr. Dyer seems to miss the point.+books
Nanny Diaries.....with palm trees+N+I usually try to give everything I read a break, but this book was nothing new or exciting. It had a couple of briefly funny spots, but other than that, it was kinda blah. Maybe it would've been more exciting had I not read the Nanny Diaries a couple of years ago. This book did, however, give you insight into why some rich kids are so nuts - because they're nothing more than an accessory for their parents+books
Blah, Blah, Blah+N+Danielle Steel has done it once again. Written a book that must have taken her all of one day. I was really disappointed after Summer in St. Tropez, but thought after a break from her books I'd try again. Sorry I wasted my time. This book is SO repetitive, same phrases are not only repeated chapter after chapter but in the same paragraph. The story line seems to drag on forever. If Steel's goal is to "dumb" her books down for the masses then she has succeeded. This book is written at about an 11-year-old's level. Don't waste your time+books
Wrong content for young children+N+First, I hardly ever write reviews...but after this story, I needed to state something.  Second, I am not considered a conservative and relatively open minded. Third, I always appreciate history and culture...and understand this story was handed down through generations.  However, never reading this story myself and reading it to my three and a half year old for the first time - I had to stop half way through the book after realizing the heart of the story surrounds a monkey killing a baby owl and the jungle searches for the killer while the mother owl grieves.  To complement the story, there is an illustration of the monkey (snarl showing sharp teeth) hitting the baby owl over the head with a branch...not a bedtime story for this family.  It was given as a gift, and will be returned shortly..+books
Classic+P+This classic is one that everyone should read and maybe even read every year!!+books
Excellent info, dry writing, exceedingly PC+P+I'm only half way through this book but I think it has some really great information.  My DH and I are planning to adopt but haven't officially started the process yet.  This book is giving us lots of issues to think about.  It provides good examples of positive language for discussing adoption with your child.  The author doesn't shy away from the hard issues like racism or a history of incest.  She does a great job of integrating child/teen development into all issues.  She cites many studies to support her advice.  The writing is rather dry (much like my own) and academic, which is actually useful.  I trust this author because her writing isn't colored by a lot of emotion.  She uses plenty of real-life examples from the experiences of adoptive families.  The book does suffer a little from being broad and trying to address all flavors of adoption (domestic & international, same race and transracial).  I highly reccomend this book to anyone considering adoption as a way to start conversations with your spouse about the hard issues you will face as adoptive parents.  Might even be a good idea to share it with extended family+books
Eye-catching title as a mistitle+N+This is a philosophy book. There is almost nothing about natural selection and not much more about religion, just plenty of standard philosophy loosely connected to a condemnation of current western culture and its supposed pseudoscience sustenance. Midgley uses the term 'evolution' to mean the philosophizing of scientists and science writers. As religion too is human philosophizing it is hardly difficult to make the two converge.  This 'evolution' Midgley citicizes as being too human-centred. As there is nothing more human-centred than the social sciences, humanities and religion and this 'evolution' is really philosophy then it is an empty criticism. Only the physical sciences look beyond humans but this is unacknowledged.  She is, though, correct in saying that natural selection is not about progress up a ladder nor about a hostile, doom and gloom world. Other than this her grasp of biology is suspect eg she asks how genes can be selfish when they die when the cells they are in die!!!!! No wonder the excellent work of people such as Dawkins is beyond her grasp if she does not understand the connection between body cells and germ-line cells.  Though I generally agree with Midgley's concerns about competitive greed and the destruction of our planet I think she is wrong to blame science, pseudoscience or sociobiology and to disconnect people in modern western culture from their ancestors and their cousins in other cultures. She is clearly out of her depth when it comes to biology, at least.  With a statement that evolution is the creation myth of our age plus the eye-catching mistitle of this book Midgley is far more guilty of hyperbole and melodrama and potentially far more misguided and damaging than, for example, Dawkins when he used the 'as if' selfish gene perspective.  There are a few interesting discussions of works by scientists and philosophers but, especially for the science writers she criticizes, I would very much recommend people read the books themselves and not simply accept Midgley's views on them.+books
fit to read over and over+P+As a card-carrying guy, and card-carrying Dave barry nut, this book is just plain dynamite. it captures how us guys behave beautifully--no, we don't behave beautifully, but it captures the primitive nature of how we behave before, and sometimes during, marriage. Since reading this book, when my wife wants an opinion about almost anything related to her, I say, "I have no opinion about that--I'm a guy! What do you expect?"  She already knew this, but having the book to go by re-enforces it. great bit about how Barry survived hurricane Andrew, which scared the daylights out of anybody, like me, anywhere near Andrew's path. Great bits about exploding vacuums and a group called the "LAwn Rangers," either of which, if I read them wile drinking coffee, would put my life in peril. a dandy little book+books
I WAS DUPED!!!!!+N+OK, people, here's some advice before you think about buying this book. Don't just look at all the 4 and 5 star customer reviews - rank the customer review list from Lowest Rank First and read all the 1 star reviews as well. That way you can REALLY get a broader sense of what you might be getting yourself into. Sure, in both the high reviews and the low reviews there's just basic no-brainer reviews - "it's great!!" or "its sucks!!" But amongst all the one star reviews I discovered some smart punters whom i SHOULD have read before buying the damn book myself. Yup, i bought this monstrous piece of rubbish and after going back and reading all the low reviews I realise that some reviewers had duly warned me. This book is TERRIBLE. It gives only the scantiest of basics on body language, stereotypical stuff which any schmuck with less than half a brain could write. And the photos - MY GOD! Its Mr Steele with his wife and their friends, posing away in their garish shirts and shorts...these are some of the ugliest photos to be used for "flirting" and "body language" I've ever ever seen. And in his blurb photo at the front of the book he's standing there shirtless revealing his copiously hairy chest - there's something about seeing the author of a book posing like this that I find highly disturbing. Yucko. As others have said, if i could give this book a zero star rating, I would. Avoid, everyone, avoid like the plague.+books
The peripatetic mission of global unity+P+The Nomadic Museum, a facility constructed onsite in various locales  (now in Santa Monica, CA) out of boxcars, cartons, and pipes is in itself an artwork and the peripatetic museum houses some wispy photographs by Gregory Colbert of moments of world observation that in context are strangely moving. The object is to bring the spirit of mankind into a space outside the usual exhibition venues and in doing so it becomes an experience for the people.  The catalogue that accompanies this show is equally impressive in its conception.  No two books are alike in that they are created from handmade Italian paper and bound in a  cover made from unique paper from Nepal.  The photographs reproduced well in the catalogue languish from being reductions of the oversized images form the exhibition, but the flavor is there.  Images of robed children and adults, animals both alone and in tandem with humans, bits and pieces of atmosphere form a journeyman's eye take on a significance that surpasses the original works.  The catalogue for the exhibition is pricey due tot he one of a kind quality of presentation.  But for those who want to forgo the expense, there is also a version of the images (paperback with 48 pages as opposed to the 232 pages of this volume) available through this site.  If you are unable to experience the exhibition (for that is truly what the exhibition is about) then this art book form of the catalogue is a substantive  memento of a unique artistic experience.

First One to Fool Me!+P+Vengeance in Death by J.D. Robb is the fifth book in this "In Death" series by this author who is the alter ego of Nora Roberts. This pseudonym is only used for her futuristic series (don't let that genre fool you - these books are fantastic, even if you don't usually like science fiction type stories!)   It seems that each of the books in this series so far has the murders involving Eve Dallas' lover/husband, Roarke, in some form or another and this one is no different. If you've read these from the first book, Naked in Death, then you've followed the relationship evolution between the two strong main characters and you've been given a glimpse of each of their pasts. Vengeance in Death explores, in greater detail, Roarke's past and that of his butler, Summerset.   A killer is loose and he's killing men with Irish links; unfortunately, that Irish link is Roarke and his past crimes. Summerset's daughter, Marlena, had been brutally murdered in Dublin, Ireland many years before and Roarke avenged her death by killing the six men responsible. Now it seems that someone is killing Roarke's informants from the past. It's Eve Dallas' job as primary homicide detective in the cases to find out who this mad man is and stop him before another victim is found.   Sounds like a typical "who dun it?" type book right? Well with J.D. Robb, you can always expect to find a bit more intrigue, romance and humor thrown into the plot. The added character of Ian McNibb (Electronic Detective Division Wonder-boy) is a pure stroke of genius. And the undertones of a romantic entanglement between McNibb and Officer Delia Peabody (Dallas' able assistant) leaves the reader wanting more and not being able to wait to read the next book to find out if these two actually do get together.   One of my favorite support characters, Mavis, is missing from this book - actually, she makes a very brief appearance, and that leaves a bit of fun out of the story line. But don't worry - the other colorful characters are all there - Commander Whitney, Police Chief Tibble, Summerset, Peabody, Dr. Mira, and of course Eve and Roarke.   The identity of the killer wasn't predictable this time, and actually had me guessing up to the end of the book. The clues as to his identity were few and far between, but the outcome made sense once everything was in the open.   Vengeance in Death is more sound writing from J.D. Robb and her versions of the future are impressive. I want a turbo car that can go from New York City to New Los Angeles in three hours just as they have in this book! (With gas prices the way they are now, I'm wondering what kind of gas and gas mileage they're getting in the future!) It will be interesting to see if the world is any closer to these creations in the year 2058 - only 57 more years to go and we'll see! But I'm first in line for one of those AutoChef inventions that cooks your meal upon voice command - no cooking, no cleaning - ah, paradise!   Vengeance in Death isn't the best book in the series that I've read, but it is still excellent. +books
Not Pocket Sized, but very good+P+This book is awesome because it teaches.  I learned so much about what to look for (and what to avoid) while shopping.  For years I thought I was "cursed" with an hourglass figure.  Then I found this book and learned that I was trying to dress as if I were built like Kate Moss.  Now, I buy the fashion magazines and look more at the SHAPE of the clothing instead of the look it has on the model.  I went from feeling dumpy and unattractive to sexy.  I have been a bargain hunter for years, and The Pocket Stylist has helped refined my tactics.  I still buy $30 shoes and $15 pairs of jeans when I come across them, but now I buy the ones that I *know* will work into my wardrobe.  Hello, functional closet.  Goodbye, "I have nothing to wear!"  My dislikes about this book?  It's only pocketsized if you carry a large bag, which I do not.  Also, the author could be more descriptive.  I have no idea what the difference is between an A-line skirt and a circle skirt, and her book does nothing to educate me on the subtleties between the two+books
Mockery from Within+P+This not-quite-debut novel (Fellowes wrote several romance novels in the mid-'70s under the name Rebecca Greville, including "Poison Presented" and "Court in the Terror") ought to appeal to fans of his 2001 Oscar-winning script for the film Gosford Park. A straightforward satirical comedy of manners set among the upper classes of mid-'90s England and those who aspire to join them, the book is a frothy comic brew which skewers both parties with the kind of pitch-perfect subtle writing that it seems only the British can pull off. The story is quite simple, a pretty woman from an upper middle-class family whose mother has pretentions decides to ensnare a hugely wealthy and dull aristocratic man in order to "marry up" into the upper classes which still hold such a mystique and importance in British society. The man's mother, a formidable Marchioness aims to prevent this from occurring but fails. The young woman discovers that life at the top isn't as exciting as she anticipated and runs off with an handsome actor to great scandal. Will anyone find happiness at the end?  This is all more or less narrated by a semi-aristocratic actor (clearly very much like the author) who is able to move between all worlds due to his upbringing and career. He starts the book as a friend of the young woman and a very passing acquaintance of the young man, and ends up becoming a bridge between worlds and at the latter stages, a kind of discreet go-between. It is his penetrating sardonic insights and the witty formulations thereof which lend what substance there is to this otherwise straightforward love story. Much of the novel involves the narrator spelling out the unspoken rules of the game for the reader in deliciously mocking detail. The main flaw in most satire is that it is too broad or unsubtle, but here the narrator's mockery of the artificially preserved world of the aristocracy is all the more effective from its insider position. To be sure, the characters are mostly "types" without a whole lot of substance or depth to them (the boorish rich pig, the nasty arriviste, the brisk no-nonsense wife, the ice queen, the social climber, etc.), but that's kind of the point as well. A great deal of the satire is that these upper crust people have no personality, that they are all just filling the roles they've seen before them and imagine will extend after them forever. Ultimately, the book is somewhat bittersweet in that the writing is quite amusing, but one can't help but feel slightly sorry for how unhappy so many of the characters are (even if they aren't particularly deeply drawn). On the other hand, it's not too hard to feel like it's a case of them getting their just desserts...+books
I wanted to like this book so badly...+N+...because I thought White Oleandar was brilliant. But this book? Not so much. I would not be surprised if Paint it Black were something Fitch wrote before she got her bestseller published. It felt much less fully realized. I found the text to be sprawling, unedited, self-indulgent. I generally have no problem with unreliable and/or unlikable narrators, but this one was more tiring than she was menacing. The whole book was written in one note, so I, too, agree with the "flat" description. I found the characters (the distant, brilliant, rich mother; the sassy best friend; the beautiful, troubled boyfriend) to be very stock and borderline cliche. I absolutely savored every word of Fitch's first book; reading this one, unfortunately, was like returning to a restaurant where you'd had the most amazing creme brulee of your life, only to find it cold and runny the second time you ordered it.+books
Great Book for Engineering Students+P+This book is great for students who are thinking of persuing a course in engineering.  Ferguson adresses what makes a great engineer, and also states that many schools do not stress the courses they should.  Using this  book, students gain insight as to what they should expect from being an  engineer, and what is imporant in the profession.  I definately recommend  this book to those who are about to be college freshman engineers or are  thinking of changing over from liberal arts &amp; sciences to engineering+books
This book has no style.+N+As a new bride, I thought this book was --well--let's say---BORING!. No style..no design and these authors are "lost" as far as what brides want in the 21st century. If you are young, hip and cool, this book is not for you. If you are old on a 4th marriage, you might like it. Also-warning ..these authors have TERRIBLE reviews on their Baby Bargains book. It seems they write all their own great reviews. I think Martha Stewart weddings is OBVIOUSLY much better and I also think I would not recommend a book from Denise and Alan Field's EVER+books
In Love in Italy+P+Hazzard is an elegant, intelligent writer, and GREAT FIRE is one of the finest novels in recent memory, but I was a bit disappointed by EVENING OF THE HOLIDAY, a slim novel which tells the summer love affair of a British traveler with an Italian landowner.  Hazzard has great insight into human nature in general and culutral identity as well, and her lyrical descriptions of the Italian countryside are lovely.  However, the story here never quite engages; the love affair is doomed from the start, we are assured, and Hazzard can't quite keep us enthralled, as she usually does, although, as in all Hazzard's work, there are stunning moments of insight and clarity, and one is astounded how easily she can throw off an aphorism+books
Sue Miller needs to give readers some credit+N+Who is her editor?  The main character self-analyzes to the point of nausea. We got it. We do not need the author to explain to us what she is trying to say.  I felt, as the reader, that the author did not trust me to "get" her own work. It would have been a much better novel had she given her readers more credit. Not to mention, if she grew up in a cold family, with no experiences to open up her sexuality and sensuality, I did not buy that one boyfriend would all of a sudden be a panacea to a lifetime of suppression.+books
Sedaris+P+Sedaris is hillarious.  The book is a compilation of short storis of his family and life history.  If anyone is an Amy Sedaris fan and wonders how she could be so eccentric than read anything by any of the Sedaris'.  "Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim," makes an entertaining leisure read.  I reccomned it+books
The Conservative Mind: From Burke to Eliot+P+This was by far the most informational book I have ever read on conservatism. I learned more about the history both the good and bad about conservatism. Also this book is very practicle and worthwhile. No hype just fact and purpose. Anybody who is a conservative should read this book so as to know the rich history we have and the future direction we are taking.   To those who are not conservative or dont know if they are conservative please read this book. It is a book that should not be taken lightly. The very history and future direction of conservatism lies within its covers. A must have in every library. It is in mine+books
great chess strategy book+P+first of all, I did not go through all examples, but I did read all the chapters. This book is truly super in the depth of coverage. Once you gained an advantageous position, how do you plan your attak? how  do you execute it? all is covered.  Only gripe: the chapter on phases of attack should have placed right after the chapter on different classic mates+books
outstanding book if used properly+P+We use this book in service dog dog when some puppies never out grow their aggressiveness. Cick and treat is used in every phase of the dogs learning in school so it was not surprising it was being in healing aggression. It has helped my personal pet,a cocker spaniel, as well as dogs in service dog school as well+books
A great tour of modern transport systems+P+John McPhee rides with a cross-country trucker who hauls chemicals; takes a course in piloting ocean going vessels; navigates the Illinois River with a thousand foot string of barges; describes how a million packages a night are sorted and shipped from a UPS facility and rides in the cab of a mile long train hauling coal. His descriptions are full, informative and never, ever boring (except once when he describes a canoe trip, but that chapter is easily skipped).    There is a very slight hint of condescension in McPhee's narrative; he is always at pains to remind the reader how little formal education his subjects have. Perhaps this is something ingrained from his New Yorker writing. Fortunately this habit is neither overly intrusive nor obnoxious.    His descriptions of each of his adventures (other than the canoe trip) are wonderfully informative. His sense of awe at UPS's massive and incredibly complex sorting facility comes through to the reader along with a marvelously detailed description of how the of miles and miles of conveyors and automated tools acting with very little human intervention move more than a million packages a night.    McPhee made me wish I could join a tow boat captain as he maneuvers a thousand foot line of barges up and down a narrow river. Or sit in the cab of a locomotive as it loads up more than a hundred cars with tons of call, a train more than a mile long that can be ascending one side of a grade while descending the other.    Overall it's quite a set of adventures and one well worth reading.  Jerr+books
Heaven In Your Life - TODAY+P+Not only does Swedenborg's Heaven &amp; Hell provide rational answers to the question, &quot;What is this life and this world all about anyway?&quot; but it also gives us the combination to unlock the door to happiness.  What's more, one of Swedenborg's central statements is that EVERYONE may choose to enter into heavenly happiness.        This is incredible!  The choices we make in our daily lives, whether from loving or hateful motives, are an expression of the ultimate choice we will make about what kind of place we wish to dwell for eternity.  The further implications of this idea is that as we form our lives by the choices that we make, we can choose to become more and more &quot;heavenly happy,&quot; right here, right now, if we apply the ideas in Swedenborg's book to our lives today.        I found these concepts to be inspirational and informative, a book that could be read over and over, always discovering some new gem of wisdom+books
EXCELLENT INSIGHT INTO THE ARTIST+P+STan really did keep and care for James and his family, including when JAmes briefly returned to Ireland to establish an art cinema chain leaving his family in ITaly.  Excellent insight into the brilliant writer by his also brilliant brother. Please read this book for greater understanding and afection for the specifics of Joyce's work (how stan was pictured in the story A Painful Case), although the view of the universal themes grows dim as we can no longer see the woods for the trees  Essential to any complete James JOyce bookshelf and a wonderful and grateful gift for any member of the fervent Joycean faith+books
An Info Sec Director's Must Have+P+So you now have the honor of creating an information security program!  Where to start and what to do is clearly laid out for you in this book.  This is a must have for anyone setting out to create a new security program within a company.  Also beneficial for IT directors and CIOs to get a broad introduction and discussion on security and disaster recovery planning.  I keep this book handy at my desk+books
...+N+I understand that the whole idea of this book is to make the reader think for himself about 'quality', which is a very interesting philisophical concept...this is presumably why Pirsig makes time for the reader to think about it by making 90% of the book as boring as possible.  This book falls between reference, fiction and biography and satisfies none of these forms. It's quite amazing how by using the right words Pirsig can make a simple theory seem extremely complicated+books
scientific, unfortunately not amusing+N+Although the book's jacket cites a lot of flattering comments like &quot;fascinating&quot; and &quot;to our pleasure, amusement ...&quot; - unfortunately this is simply not true. The book is - for the average reader - overly scientific, dry and boring+books
Boring+N+This was required reading for my 15 year old son and he said: It was boring+books
Well, I'd like to say I liked the book...but+N+I couldn't read the whole thing in order to know for sure. It was dry. I didn't get the imagery - I know it's supposed to be a classic, and I really wanted to read the book, I did - but it was long and boring and I just don't get why it's so "classicly popular". Sorry, but it's how I feel. Now, that being said, I read a condensed version of it, and I discovered the story was a little bit interesting - but that's as far as I can go, even with the condensed version - it was only "a little bit" interesting+books
A Fantastic Exercise in "What If"+P+This isn't really a novel and it isn't really a collection of short stories, but the vignettes are more fable than whimsy because fables are filled with lessons.  Alan Lightman writes about many possibilities of the alternate reality of time, as he imagines Einstein envisioned them.  Each alternate reality builds off a cliched phrase we use to describe time:  Time is Money, Time Flows Uphill, Live in the Present - Forget the Past, Time is Motion, etc.   Lightman writes beautifully and his imagined realities are intriguing, each could be the setting for powerful stories.  It's a quick read, a fun read, and well worth the 'time.'  - CV Ric+books
Magnificent Police Era History+P+The book covered the period of history just at the turn of the 20th Century. I found it to be very informative and made me feel like I was right there strolling the streets with Ted Roosevelt. Although the book is  strong in its era coverage more attention should have been given to the  various laws and acts that were in place at the time preventing  &quot;police&quot; to perform their respective functions+books
What was not to love about this book!!+P+I have read most of Eric J. Dickey's books and this one was a different writing style. It was a great book though. It was interesting and the end was not too easy to figure out. It kept me til the very last page. I do recommend+books
So near, and yet ...+N+Annie Proulx has the ability to paint images with words that most artists and photographers can only dream of doing in their media.  This fact alone makes her book an enjoyable read by anyone who reads a lot.  Unfortunately, imagery is about all there is to recommend Bad Dirt: Wyoming Stories 2.  The narratives tend to drag in many of the stories, in others the author has trouble getting the suspension of belief she seems to be looking for.  All in all, for this reader at least, a major disappointment.  For readers who have enjoyed other works by Proulx, I wouldn't recommend reading this one+books
Acceptable+N+The beginning held my attention well enough, but about halfway through the book I gave up and skipped to the end. Excellent characters and interesting research, but Fiammetta and Bucino drown in a web of plot lines. More like a few episodes of a TV show than a movie.+books
this book misses the point+N+i think Susan Sontag is missing the political nature of illness.  as far as i'm concerned there is a culture of blaming the victim in our society that is not limited to medicine.  the victim is blamed because the victim has little power.  the ill person is blamed because the tobacco companies are powerful, the oil companies are powerful, the sugar companies are powerful, the retail chains are powerful, the manufacturers are powerful, the health insurance companies are powerful and the governments are powerful.  they have armies of lawyers to defend them; they have armies of doctors, scientists, and psychiatrists to fabricate pseudo-scientific evidence to support their self interest, but the victim is powerless to defend themselves against blame.  this isn't about language, it's about politics of money and power.  language is only one of the tools that the powerful use to blame the ill, and victims more generally+books
for the most part, very good :)+P+i liked the story line a lot, the only thing i did not like was that the author -repeatedly- had to say what a perfect body the main character had. lol. i mean after the sixth time.. we got it! lol.. definitely a guy and definitely fantasizing when he wrote it i'm guessing..  perfectly toned, perfect everywhere else. good, now move on! :)  other than that, i really liked the description of what the "bad guy" mechanisms were. too bad i can't use those kinds of disguises in real life. very interesting :)  i'd still recommend the book :+books
Quick, enjoyable read...quirky, comical writing!  :-)+P+I've seen several not-so-good reviews of this book so I wanted to write a good one.  I'm not finished reading it yet, but I only have about 60 pages left and I've read enough of it to know that I'm thoroughly enjoying it.  There are parts of the book that are laugh-out-loud funny and other parts that are so detailed and insightful that I am enjoying this novel on many levels.  If you like authors whose writing is what I call "quirky" (a little on the weird side but I mean that in a good way...interesting and funny details on almost every page), you'll love this book.  I know that my local library has at least three other books by this author and I intend to get every last one of them during my next trip to the library.  The kind of quirky, comical, insightful writing that I like is best represented by the following book, which I actualy bought instead of borrowing it from the library, and I don't buy books very often:  A Girl Named Zippy: Growing Up Small in Mooreland Indiana by Haven Kimmel  http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0767915054/ref=pd_sxp_f/104-1969313-5510321?v=glance&s=books  If you liked "Until the Real Thing Comes Along" by Elizabeth Berg, you will absolutely love "A Girl Named Zippy" by Haven Kimmel+books
0 stars, actually!+N+In a nutshell, the ludicrous scenarios and insinuations in this book are so stupid and insulting to ANYONE's intelligence that I'm surprised it got published at all. A lawyer wrote this garbage, huh? I wonder where he graduated from. Perhaps he obtained his 'degree' from the same place Scott Peterson got the 3 fake ones hanging on HIS wall? Unbelievable! Did this 'author', and I use this term loosely, EVER do any real research on this case?  This Dalton character who wrote this book obviously just needed a money fix. Must be a mediocre-at-best attorney to have to stoop to this level of ethical malfeasance. A total lack of integrity on his part is an issue as well.  For those who care about Laci Peterson and the TRUTH of her murder read Sharon Rocha's book, "For Laci" as well as Catherine Crier's Book, "A Deadly Game". Also, do some research on the investigation itself-a lot of information is in the public domain. If I could find information on this case myself, a lowly civilian, then surely Dalton could have. I just don't think he wanted to, frankly. I believe I could write a better and more accurate book all on my lonesome!  Skip this book unless you truly don't think Scott Peterson killed his wife and son. +books

Disappointing+N+Having travelled all over the USA by automobile, I was disappointed at the paucity of information and the highly selective coverage in this book.  I had hoped to obtain an update, and more comprehensive coverage of all 50 states.  I found it too selective with major ommissions by state (e.g. Kentucky has no entries at all) and smaller to mid-size communities such as Champaign, Illinois, or the beautiful Rock River valley of NW Illinois are conspicuous by their absence.  Most disturbing is this.  I live in the Greater Houston, TX, area, and read the authors' motel recommendation on US-59.  Not only is that motel and immediate area known for being a place of constant drug raids, but also it is a major area of known street prostitution and that motel seems to house them.  I hardly consider that "family friendly"+books
5 stars? Really?+N+Mark Rank proposes many interesting ideas that attempt redefine how we think about poverty in America.  Most of his ideas are solid, but my deepest concern is with the readers who gave this book 5 stars and used the word "interesting" to describe it.  Did they actually read it?  This book is an unending parade of boring and repeated ideas presented in different, yet equally boring ways.  I honestly beleive that this book has destroyed the thrill of musical chairs for me forever.  This book could have been written in about 150 pages instead of the 250 it actually took if he simply used his original, not to mention solid, ideas.  The nature of the book greatly weakened his overall argument.    Not only was the book dry, but it also seemed to fail to acknowledge the global system the US is a part of, and in particular, the role that immigration plays on poverty in the US.  He talks about the US and the people in it as if they were static, but we live in a very fluid world, growing more fluid everyday, and I feel that his failure to ackowledge this fact truly hurts his overall argument. +books
A superb book - highly recommended+P+This is the best book about dogs in general and Daxies in particular that I have held in my hands. Don't let the title fool you - this is a book that, while written in plain English, will teach you a multitude of things - how to care, train, and bond with your Dax from puppyhood to old age. I have already recommended it to any dog owner I know, regardless of their breed, because many of the things inside the book are applicable to all breeds, not just the Daxies. I highly recommend that you add this book to your cart, you will not be sorry you did+books
One unused to dispose of+N+Turn of the century continues to serve a most useful purpose, months after I gave up on it. I have a door that rattles if it's not wedged open and T-o-C is just big enough and heavy enough to do the job on its own. I struggled, oh how I struggled to try and even begin to understand some of the characters. I stirred the pages wildly while I waited for the plot to thicken. I fought against closing eyelids while the book became heavier and heavier. I searched my abridged guide to good grammar to see if I had missed a couple of chapters explaining that sentences after all don't need a subject, a verb and an object - or even a permutation of two out of three. I left it on the front doorstep hoping somebody would steal it. I offered it to my  neighbor so he could jack up his car. I considered lighting the fire with it. I wondered whether, if I took just a few pages a day, I could eat it and get rid of the evidence. I offered it to my mother-in-law for Christmas. I took it scuba diving with me instead of a weight belt. And then, eventually, voila! The rattling door! What a fine tome T-o-C is. Another few hundred pages [...] and I could have used it as a sea anchor for the Titanic+books
Pretty Great Book+P+I liked the stories and thought they were entertaining and erotic, but I think they could have gone a little further into true eroticism, and less further into simple vulgarity.It's not often that I like every story in any book with several, but that's just what happened with this book. I really did enjoy each and every story. It contains enough stories that at least several almost undoubtedly will hit with each reader. This book was great fun and never once even tried to convince me, the reader, that it was anything more than a collection of stories designed to excite and titillate. But this one remains my favorite.The book includes some really good writers too+books
Three Points About this Book+N+After reading this book, I would like to make three points about it:  1.) First of all, DON'T MAKE THIS YOUR FIRST DEAN KOONTZ BOOK.  This is the second book of the so-called Christopher Snow trilogy.  Read the first book in the trilogy first -- FEAR NOTHING.  The first book introduces pretty much all the key characters that you find in this book.  2.) Second, please be aware that Koontz has yet to write the third book in the Christopher Snow trilogy.  This is a real shame, because SEIZE THE NIGHT ends on a cliffhanger of sorts.  Koontz has claimed that he will write the third book someday, under the title RIDE THE STORM.  But since it's been over eight years since Koontz has written a Snow novel, I wouldn't expect this book anytime soon.    3.) Third, I must admit I didn't really care for this book at all, and I say that as a Koontz fan.  Lots of padding -- the action doesn't really start until page 250.  Koontz wastes a LOT of space repeating things he originally wrote in FEAR NOTHING.   I found myself skipping through this book quite a bit to get to the good parts.  The plot here is also too over the top -- plot elements include time travel, killer monkeys, alternate realities, serial killers conducting government experiments -- and that's just the tip of the iceberg!  Even the characters in the book don't seem to take any of it seriously.  All the dialogue in this book is whimsical and unrealistic.  I was therefore never able to suspend disbelief for this book.  It was just too silly for my tastes.  Koontz is a great writer, but his best novels are the ones that have a more believable, fast-paced plot.  Instead of this book, I would therefore recommend WATCHERS, INTENSITY, ODD THOMAS or VELOCITY. +books
Addicted to this Cookbook+P+I learned about Debra Ponzek from a Nick Jr. Newsletter at my child's daycare center in Connecticut.  I tried her Cowboy Cookies recipe from the article and I was hooked on Ponzek.  It's pretty cool that she is a Connecticut resident as well.  I love the fact that recipes are kid-friendly with adult appeal.  No smiley faced plates,...just yummy food.  I've only had the cookbook for 3 weeks and have enjoyed the following recipes:  tuna, pasta & celery salad, fresh mayo,spinach salad with dried cherries, almonds, & blue cheese, ham, cheddar & tom quesadillas, arugula and proscuitto pizza, aux delices marinara, rigatoni with ricotta, tomato, and basil, two simple sauces of basil-lemon pesto and sweet tom marmalade which i served with pan-seared tilapia, and vegetable fried rice.  My hands-down fave has been the pizza.  The aux delice sauce is my fave to date & i've made many from the food tv network chefs+books
Great Information for the Restorer+P+This is an excellent guide for the person that is considering restoring a bungalow, not just a gardener .  The pictures show many outside amenities including walkways, doors, fencing, lighting, and porches.  Great source  for ideas and models+books
Laura+P+In an inventive, imaginative plot, John Dunning successfully combines elements from 20th century literary and film history into a tale of deceit and psychological manipulation. Each of the players in this intricate plot of murder is lying - but about who, about what? Cliff Janeway tackles the conundrum in his usual style - intelligent, canny, suspicious, and sometimes over-emotional - and nearly comes to grief himself. What makes him such an appealing kind of guy is his need to act on his principles, regardless of risk. An intriguing backstory, twisty subplot, and surprise ending make Sign of the Book another page-turner+books
Environmental Psychology+P+Fascinating look at how architecture and interior design influence our mood and behavior. You gain general priciples and insights into what makes an space inviting or unappealing.  This is a great book for an architect or interior designer with an interest in environmental psychology.  This is NOT a "how to" book for consumers who want remodeling ideas+books
Some love it, some hate it...I love it!+P+I read this in high school and could certainly relate to Holden at the time. He's an angry, rebellious, sarcastic teen with a serious attitude problem. Throughout the story, he grows, he learns and he faces some really horrible things in his past. The story is 'badly' written to some standards but in an artistic way which reflects the character. There are a lot of intense situations and some profanity (as a teen I was like "Cool!" hehe). In the beginning, Holden seems to hate te world. You start out hating Holden and thinking he is a jerk but through the course of the story you learn so much about him and you share his pain. You learn that benieth a tough mask, lies a smart, sensitive and thoughtful person. It's a flawed story, with a flawed character in a flawed world but it all seems so real that you feel like you are there. It has a lot of dry, sarcasic humor which had me laughing out loud in class. Mostly it's a story about growing up and the journey of a young man discovering who he really is in a world full of phony people. I can see why this is a classic! A warning though to those who are sensitive or easily offended: There are some sad parts and lots of foul language but without this it would not be the same story! It's a timeless story and I would certainly read this book again+books
Not as funny as I hoped+N+Written a little bit too ironically. I did enjoy the reference to Encyclopedia Brown. Fun for a quick read and perhaps for those who are more enmeshed in the ND world than I+books
...A bit fiddly in my opinion...+N+Well, my wife and I tried this diet plan, and lost a little, BUT... CON: some of the ingredients and just a marketing ploy. CON: It makes no mention of what to do if you're lactose intolerant. CON: How do you thicken a sauce without cornstarch?  Arrowroot?  Pretty hard to locate in most grocery stores.  File Gumbo? Makes a green gloppy mess out of your meal. CON: Somewhat poorly written, more poorly compiled into a book, and the person or persons in charge of the index need to be educated (back to school with you now!) in compiling a COMPREHENSIVE index.  Facts and figures are just too hard to find in this book. PRO: SHe's probably rich from sales of this re-hash of Atkins, Sugar-busters, and Carb Addicts. PRO: She's easier on the eyes than Atkins was+books
Best Trilogy Since "Lord of The Rings"+P+Steve Schirripa's  "The Goomba Diet" does for Italian cuisine what "The Da Vinci Code" does for Catholicism -- the only difference is that once the Pope reads Schirripa's book, he's going to make Steve an official Saint.  Following in the tradition of his previous literary masterpieces,  ("The Goomba's Guide to Life" and "The Goomba's Guide to Love")   Schirripa has accomplished the impossible by  writing a book that's even funnier than his first two.  Whether you're Italian or Jewish, fat or thin, heterosexual or a fanook, "The Goomba Diet"  delivers a powerful message from which the world can benefit. And by "the world",  I mean overweight Italian criminals  indicted under the RICO Statute who enjoy Penne Arrabiata.   Not only is "The Goomba Diet"  superior to any book currrently on the New York Times bestseller list, but it proves why  Steve Schirripa  deserves to host his own late night  network television talk show -- he's far more talented than Jimmy Kimmel, Carson Daly, and or that annoying Scottish guy on CBS.  And if boring idiots  like "Jerry R. from Montreal" like this book, then it can be enjoyed by EVERYONE.+books
Priceless resource+P+I bought and devoured Will Write for Food and completely loved it. It's readable, entertaining, informative, and most of all, inspiring. As a food writer for nine years who is continually struggling to build up my career, I found the book to be full of practical, useful ideas and possibilities for exciting new directions for my work. I can't wait to see more from this author.+books
Good advice overall+P+This is a great book for anyone in advertising or who is in a lead role or is an entrepeneur.  That is what the author is: the head and founder of a leading advertising company or at least what he used to be until he sold the company.  I find most of the advice to be legit because I've been working in corporate America for a long time and I have come across good and bad managers, but mostly bad ones, unfortunately.  There are some ideas or values that are obviously his personal preference or it may be just talk so he stands out from other people.  I think it is a must-read for anyone in advertising or thinking of starting a business as advertising is a major area if not the most important area that will help drive your business in the right direction.  My only caveat about the book is that it is too long.  This is somewhat not surprising since the author is not a writer and the writing is not as concised and well-written as if written by someone more professional in the craft+books
A Way to Destroy the Declaration of Independence+N+In this book, the author tries to encourage Americans to forget the Declaration of Independence because even though a plurality of men have rights, the rights of individuals have never been identified.  So, the author becomes a member of Marilyn Ferguson's Aquarian Conspiracy and the New Age movement, which place individuals above `the people' of the USA and its Union.  On p. 277, the author says that the truth or falsities of the natural rights philosophy of the Declaration of Independence is a meaningless question.  While the author's conclusions can be challenged, his book has been out-dated by advanced knowledge.  First, his writing is out-dated by the 1920 discovery that' all empirical data are symbolic.' Thus, one must ask, 'How can the meaning of the Declaration of Independence become a meaningless when the Declaration is formed out of symbols that must be given meaning in order to interpret it correctly?  Second, modern science has recently led to the scientific proof of God's existence.  How can man have no natural rights if God exists?  If the author's succeeding generations are accepting this book, the USA is in deep trouble.+books
GREAT+P+This book arrived in adequate time and was in great condition. There was no trouble with delivery, it was on time+books
Another self-indulgent Heinlein novel+N+Heinlein loads this book up with hooks in the early pages to catch your attention.  Unfortunately, these hooks turn out to be superfluous and lead nowhere.  This shoddy technique is found in all four of Hienlein's final books.  We are also treated to some of Heinlein's stock characters, dirty old men, horny female computers, naked adolescent girls, and dominant beauties who would be right at home in leather and whips.  Without these archetype characters most Heinlein novels written after 1970 would have a sparse population indeed.  As if this isn't enough, Heinlein drags in his usual cast of characters from his other novels as he is so prone to doing.  In spite of all their cameo appearances, this group remains dull and one dimensional throughout.  Heinlein's earlier novels written prior to 1960 are still fine fare for young people, especially boys.  This novel, as well as most of Heinlein's later work will be enjoyed primarily by a group of die hard fans and is definitely not for general consumption+books
An Exciting Modern Classic+P+I picked this book up not knowing what it was about, just knowing that it had won the Pulitzer.  I have now read it twice; the first time I read it I thought very highly of it, but the second time I read it I not only looked at it as one of the greatest American Classics of our time but I looked at it as a fun, early 1900's, college book.  One part of the book I exspecially liked was when Martin confesed to both of his girlfriends that he was engaged to both of them at the same time!  I love it!  Sinclair Lewis was so ahead of his time with that episode!  This is Lewis' finest work, a homage to the art of medicine and the spirit of a young man searching for himself and his career.  A must have book+books
Healthy Forgiveness is True Forgiveness+P+Written in a compassionate and wise manner intended for those who have experienced a very harrowing situation, this book explores and offers emotionally healthy tools for healing the deepest hurts inflicted by someone very close to us. Based on real-life case stories the book explores in a reality-oriented manner the paradox of true forgiveness that allows deep and complete healing for a person. This is not about blaming the victim or sugar-coated attempts at glossing over mud with whip cream ... it is getting to the core hurt and really mending a broken heart so it is stronger and wiser and safer than before. A must read+books
Very profitable reading.+P+I really liked this book. It is a classic book for those who are interested in managing their finances according to Biblical principles, and for those who have landed themselves into debt. Larry Burkett teaches biblical principles of debt-management by telling stories... stories collected over years of counseling thousands of struggling individuals and couples. Some of the previous reviewers have said that these stories are just anecdotal scare-tactics, but the intriguing thing is that I see highly-educated people around me making the same "anecdotal" mistakes with their finances (and reaping the consequences). Americans (in general) have no clue how much house they can afford, etc. and regard debt as a necessary evil... or even as a good thing. This book helps you to see debt in a more balanced light, and is highly recommended to anyone who struggles in this area.  As you can see by some of the other reviews, if you're not a Christian, you'll probably get hung up on some of the biblical principles: such things like keeping your word even when it costs you money, family leadership principles, living within your means, and the husband-wife relationship. So if you're not a Christian, I would suggest taking a serious look at the Bible (by studying what it says) and then compare it to the principles in this book. I think you'll find that the Bible is reliable and timeless in its guidelines for finances just as it is for every other area of life+books
Not very useful and poorly put together+N+This book was not at all what I expected.  I have NO desire to use burlap as a window treatment.  In additon, the photography is very poor.  The colors are washed out and the windows are just bright white.  I would not have bought this book if I could have seen it before hand.  I do not recommend this book+books
overrated+N+This book came highly recommended and got some great blurbs, but in my opinion is quite overrated. The writing isn't particularly good, and there really isn't much meat. There are actually no REAL descriptions of most of the action. For instance, we know she and her two pals hated turning to cannibalism, but that's all (compare/contrast to "Life of Pi" by Yann Martel, which if full of gory detail of being stranded at sea, but that's what makes it real!). By the way, when one starving animal eats another starving animal, they still starve to death, because of the lack of essential fatty acids. Most mainstream fiction editors appear to have little if any knowledge of science, unfortunately. I came away from this read with very little in the way of vicarious experience and only a few (repetitive) visual images. It reads like a pretentious but untalented teenager's diary+books
ugggh+N+I've read every one of Iris Johansen's "suspense" novels and have loved most of them.  The last couple though have been so painful to get through. This one however, I don't think I can even finish.  I read where someone called these characters "cardboard," and I couldn't agree more.  The female heroine randomly throws in curse words in a cheap attempt to create tension between herself and the supposed male protagonist.  Whereas in the Eve Duncan Books and the Wind Dancer books we are drawn into the story and come to care for the characters, it is patently obvious what will happen with each of these characters - makes me think of a writing 101 class.  "Now this should happen here, and this here, and this here and boom, climax, happily every after."    I hope that Iris can get her groove back and begin writing novels worth my time. +books
Disappointing+N+I've read all of Iris Johansen's novels and thoroughly enjoyed many of them--this, however was not one of them.  I found the plot hard to follow with too many references to her previous book.  What mysterious event happened to Jock and Royd?  Who is MacDuff--well if you haven't read the previous novel, you'll never know+books
Quick & Easy???+N+Very disappointed!!  I am a very busy mom who tries very hard to cook healthy & low cal for the whole family.  When I buy a cookbook that claims it's quick & easy, I do not expect the recipes to have an average of 15 to 20 ingredients in them.  I don't know what this author considers quick, but I sure don't think there is anything quick about these recipes!  No pictures either+books
Signifying Nothing+N+Macbeth V.v 25-30: "A tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing."   Stream-of-conscieness technique (no punctuation), southern accents (no spell check), mixed and matched timecrawls (flashbacks without warning), sequencing narrators (voice change with no scene break), first and third person viewpoints (confused yet?), and slapped-your-faceee! symbolism.  For literature, I choose Hemingway (who can be subtle or direct, but is always clear).  Good books should be enjoyable and understandable.  I understand the story Faulkner was trying to tell about a Jerry-Springeresque southern family, but I didn't like the novel.  If you want to enjoy dsyfunctional American families with blistering social commentary watch 'South Park'-- much funnier.  I'll let one of Faulkner's contemporaries speak:  "Poor Faulkner. Does he really think big emotions come from big words? He thinks I don't know the ten-dollar words. I know them all right. But there are older and simpler and better words, and those are the ones I use." --Ernest Hemingway  Unless you are forced into this book for a literature class, don't buy it and don't read it.  If you look hard enough, anything can become meaninful, even this tripe.  Victor Hugo, Shakespeare, and those ancient greeks are excellent in that their works have themes and meanings already.  You don't have to overanalyze and create meaning where none exists in order to enjoy those works.    Faulkner is babble and murky and opaque with circular symbolism fading into tempestous violence only an idiot pretending genius or an eleemosynary prententious genius enjoying idiocy might love and obtuse run-on sentences longer than this one are exactly what you'll find all over this classical work+books
absolute bosh+N+Gray is so far off the target when it comes to nutrition and exercise.He says women might gain weight from exercise? Didn't he ever hear about if you burn more calories than you take in you'll lose weight? Simple math Gray!Everything about this book smacks of sell,sell,sell! snail oil salesmanship.When will he  realize people have different needs bssed on individuality rather than gender.No one has any business making the blanket statements he makes,it's irresponsible. Another very corny statement is women get good brain chemistry from affection and cuddling,while men get good brain chemistry from sex.How much longer is society going to promote these  myths? Bad advice,irresposible and plain corny+books
Better and Better+P+Book #13 in the In Death Series. In this book there is a serial killer on the loose and he is murdering people connected to Roarke.  Eve is in a race to figure out who hired this hitman and whats the connection with Roarke.  There is also a visit from an old Irish friend of Roarkes who was thought to be dead. There is also some development in the McNab/Peabody relationship.  While there are some tears shed, Eve is forced to take a Timeout to be a good friend to Peabody. I love these books and as each one is so different, the quality is still excellent+books
The Biology of Doom+N+This book seems more like a review of records then adding anymore info. I doubt if any more research has gone in to this book then average high school graduate goes through. I felt it was a waste of time and money  Panka+books
The Bible....+P+I can't think of a single REAL JAZZ MUSICIAN who has not read this book...if not they are reading it PRESENTLY!!!!!!! It is the ultimate reference guide. When the Jazz community lost Mr. Feather we lost an invaluable friend and supporter of the artform we affectionately refer to as JAZZ+books
A Timeless Classic+P+The Black Jacobins is a timeless classic in both the  history and practice of liberation theory.I enjoyed the distinct pleasure  of taking undergraduate work with CLR James in the early eighties. His undimmed  passion and clarity shaped me deeply. He was quite arguably the greatest  unabashed dialectical materialist of the Harlem Renaissance. I heartily  recommend that you treat yourself to this,his signature creation+books
Half magic+N+I purchased this book as a read aloud for my two oldest children.  I liked the story but the chapters were way too long.  My children kept asking, "how many more pages?"+books
WISH I HAD SWITCHED FROM THE SWITCH!!!+N+Have read several Leonard books and this may be the worst one I have read. The two so called "bad men" remind me of my self if I tried to do what they did. NOTHING goes right. Ordell Robbie and Louis Gara grab Mickey Dawson, wife of Frank Dawson, to hold for ransom. Frank could care less. He has a mistress and does not want his wife back. This makes Mickey very upset and she decides she wants part of the action with Ordell and Louis. Meanwhile, the mistress decides she wants to be part of their plan too. You will meet crazy Richard, who likes to shoot people. There was page after page of just talk. Nothing happening. I kept thinking it would get better but no such luck. If you are having trouble sleeping try this book+books
A GOOD STORY, TOLD+P+Stephen Ambrose's book tells the story of D company, 6th para. and the taking of the bridges over the Orne canal and river.  It is an excellent, if skimpy, telling of one of the facinating stories of WWII.  I have always found the incident interesting since seeing it portrayed in &quot;The Longest Day&quot;  It is a quick read, and I'd have liked more detail, but it is a good book none the less+books
Weak Link in a Great Series+N+I read A is for Alphabet years ago and did not get pulled into the series.  Years later I read S is for Silence and was hooked. I started to read the series--backwards at first and then jumped to the beginning.  I have really enjoyed the books and felt a connection to the heroine (and forgiven Ms. Grafton for making her weigh 118 lbs on her 5'6" frame).  However, I agree with the other readers who feel like this is not Grafton at her best.  You just can't believe that Kinsey would put herself in these ridiculous positions---belting a police officer to endear herself to a woman she is investigating, remaining in an incredibly (and unbelievable) dangerous situation, to name a few.  The dialogue is weak,the sexual situations seem gratutitous, and there is a fair amount of stereotyping of hispanics.  But even with these issues, I did finish the book.  Grafton at her low point is still a good read+books
eh, whatever.+N+I bought this cookbook expecting it to have a few fun, easy recipes for wraps that I could toss together with stuff I had around the kitchen.  Although the recipes and certainly the pictures look delicious, fun and easy they're not.  It's not uncommon for recipes to have over a dozen  ingredients.  When I want to toss together a little lunch, I don't have  time to track down 1/4 cup chopped pickled ginger or 2 cups cooked jasmine  rice or 1/4 teaspoon orange oil.  I have yet to make a single recipe from  this book, despite having owned it for over nine months+books
Not Recommended, Especially Considering the Much Superior Alternatives+N+I was quite disappointed with Ballast's Graphic Division review.  Not only is the book itself sloppily laid out, and quite incomplete in regard to the information provided within it, there are much better alternatives out there.  Norman Dorf's "Solutions" guide is a much better preparation guide, one that I wholeheartedly recommend to anybody about to tackle the ARE Graphic Exams+books
The Feminist War on Women.+P+One of the major reasons why radical feminism remains such a destructive influence on the lives of Americans is that it claims to speak for women when it really only represents a minute percentage of them. The feminista activist has proved quite adept at obscuring this fact by labeling their critics as "patriarchal, anti-woman" and "sexist." The irony lost on many is that no social movement in history has so thoroughly undermined the constituency they pretended to represent.  As always, the opinions of males are discounted, and whatever words men write are deemed compromised, so let us be grateful that Carrie Lukas came along. She is an equity feminist in the mold of Christina Hoff Sommers and Daphne Patai, and what many readers already know is that equity feminist is to gender or radical feminist what the Green Berets are to terrorists. Lukas's new book is an insightful answer to the pervasive lies so often told about men. Her main theme is that differences between the sexes exist, and there's no reason to label them as good or evil. Viva la difference should be the order of every day. By the end, you'll be pleased that she took the time to pen such an eloquent refutation of the alleged, and fictional, patriarchy.   Lukas rationally cuts through the lies and distortions which so poison our ether. You'll find skillful refutations to canards like men being the primary cause of domestic violence, that divorce is beneficial to women, and that being born with a particular kind of genitalia enables one to "have it all." The real problem with gender feminists is that their need to dominate and control others is far more important to them than their supposed goal of bettering the lives of women. Behind their hysterical passion hides a collective of dominatrixes. The only thing that their politics uniformly promote is an increase in their own status and increased feelings of self-righteousness.   On aggregate, Lukas's narrative voice is outstanding as she is the possessor of an analytical and dispassionate mind. In my opinion, she even provides a more balanced assessment of radical positions than they actually deserve. The only negative thing I can say about this book is that I suspect few women will read it. My guess is that this is due to its not being feel good or warm-fuzzy enough for them. What those who habitually avoid the non-comforting forget is that knowing the truth is an end in itself, and that a hard chair made of wood is still more soothing than one made wholly from imagination.+books
With friends like these...+N+This book is trash written by a man with no faculty for research and no clear understanding of the subject. First define eccentric people as unconventional  types who are healthy, happy and functional (unhappy, nonfunctional types are after all neurotic- not eccentric).  Then make the astounding discovery that eccentrics are happier,healthier and more functional than the average.  If this sounds like science to you then you might enjoy the book.    The author fails to distinguish between eccentrics who  don't care about conformity , and those unfortunates who are grossly deluded or constitutionally incapable of conformity.  The author fails to recognise cold-blooded social sarcasm as oppposed to eccentricity.    As an experienced eccentric I  found the book  poorly thought out, self contradictory, and somewhat patronizing+books
Not For Everyone+N+I gave this book to 45 participants in an innovative leadership training class as a pre-reading exercise.  They gave it back to me because of the following reasons: the layout is difficult to follow, you need a glossary  to keep up with the acronyms. and what exactly is the point here+books
Ponnuru Is All Mixed Up, right from his book's title!+N+Title begins:  "The Party of Death: The Democrats..."   Just tonight - August 14, 2006 - while being interviewed about this book on the Colbert Report, Ponnuru *clarified* that what he calls "The Party of Death" is really a collective of all who are pro abortion, regardless of political party! Ponnuru explained that he knows it's NOT ALL Democrats that are pro abortion, and he openly admitted there are Republicans who are pro abortion!  So Colbert asked Ponnuru if he had also included the word "Republican" on the book's cover (to be fair) to show that some Republicans are in Ponnuru's collective "Party of Death", and Ponnuru said no, he did not include the word "Republican" on his book's cover, and Colbert then asked that maybe Ponnuru didn't have enough ink to print the word "Republican" on the cover, or maybe Ponnuru didn't think he had enough room on the cover to include the word "Republicans" along with "Democrats" for the reader to understand his collective "Party of Death," which again, according to Ponnuru on national TV, is a group category that includes all who are pro abortion, not just Democrats.   Yet the inside flap of this book asks, Is the Democratic Party the "Party of Death"?   Does Ponnuru even know what he's talking about when he's this mixed up, completely contradicting his book's cover and inside flap on national TV?+books
My favorite Connelly book because he starts with what he knows, journalism+P+Michael Connelly used to be a crime journalist. THat's why I think this mystery, which has a journalist as the main character (a guy named Jack McEvoy) works so very well, with every scene jumping off the page and certain scenes making the hairs on the back of my neck stand up!       Now about the plot...McEvoy's brother, a cop, is dead and the death is declared a suicide. But McEvoy doesn't buy it, knowing his brother as well as he does. Of course, others think he is simply in "denial" but as McEvoy digs deeper, suspicious patterns start to emerge, linking cop "suicides" with a network of pedophiles and, in particular, one pedophile, nicknamed "The Poet" for his use of lines of Poe poems, lines which he leaves at the scenes of his crimes.      Every chapter, every page, seems realistic, believable. I was immediately riveted and even though I did sense the killer before the final pages, it took nothing away from reading a book so well-crafted with such fine detais. Connelly made me feel like I was walking around IN McEvoy's shoes, looking through his eyes.      So there you have it - a bare plot outline and an opinion about a very fine writer. I DO suggest you start with this book, as Connelly's quality can go up and down from book to book - or perhaps some of his works simply resonate with me more than others. This book is a top notch mystery+books
Warning: this novel may be dangerous to diabetics+N+I sat down to read about this after hearing about it for years, and I want my week back. It only took that long because I had to push myself to finish it.  SPOILERS AHEAD: Meggie and Father Ralph (who everyone always seems to refer to as Ralph de Bricassart, even when they're talking to him) meet when he is twenty-six and Meggie is...ten. She speaks, acts and thinks like a 5-year-old, though. As the years go by, Father Ralph de Bricassart becomes sort of a father figure to little Meggie, and she develops a girlish crush on him. As Meggie is also "developing a very feminine figure," Ralph comes to love her in return but realizes that their love can never be. They discuss this in approximately fifteen thousand "Don't love me, my darling, for I love you but you know our love is forbidden and can never be" conversations throughout the book. Finally, after years of smothering their passion, they do it. In a really very boring scene that's all inner ruminating and blurred descriptions. And wouldn't ya know it, she gets pregnant. Ralph de Bricassart realizes (again) that their love can never be, and leaves. Meggie has his baby, and capers about gleefully that she's "stolen" something back from God. But wouldn't ya know it, the kid (who's as angelic and one-dimensional a boy I've ever encountered in literature) decides to be a priest. So she sends him to Father Ralph de Bricassart for training, who--get this--is so totally brain dead that IT NEVER ONCE OCCURS TO HIM THAT THIS MIGHT BE HIS CHILD!!!!!!! Apparently arithmetic is not a compulsory part of training for the priesthood; this guy also misses an incredibly broad hint from Meggie, when even the other priests figure it out. The Big Secret finally does come out (again in a very brief, anticlimactic scene) toward the end, but by then we're too busy skimming to really care.  All this leaves out a great many things--including immortal dialogue that makes Meggie sound perpetually ten years old ("I'll tell you something else about your roses, Ralph de Bricassart--they've got nasty, hooky thorns!"), endless, heavyhanded symbolism (ashes of roses, thorn birds...we get it! we get it!), some dumb subplot concerning a brother who is absent for 90% of the book, and one of the most unintentionally hilarious "tragic" scenes I've ever read (death by pig). Yet the Ralph-and-Meggie storyline really is the only major thing going on. And we never really get to see what it is that draws these two people together. I was expecting other subplots and development of other characters, and this never really happened. Many of the other relationships were sketchy and/or very confusing: Meggie's cruel judgment of her daughter Justine as a "monster" and a "b* tch," for example, seemed to have no basis. The last third or so involves Meggie making peace with her mother and daughter, and it just doesn't matter. The quick "the end" wrap-up would have been an even greater letdown if I'd still cared by that point. Even the most developed characters are flat and lifeless, and thoroughly unlikable. Scarlett O'Hara was selfish, but she was fun; these people are selfish and boring. Sickly-sweet quasi-romantic trash.+books
Seems pretty right wing to me+N+From what I can tell by the reviews on this page, all the proposals in this book are basically libertarian. It is thus highly misleading that the book calls itself centrist. The fact that only one person on this page has realized this, yet seems to think it's a good thing, is also rather disturbing.  The book seems like a thinly veiled attempt to move political dialogue rightward by making radical neoconservative proposals--many of which the Bush administration clearly supports--seem moderate.  Let's call a spade a spade+books
Support Science NOT Superstition !!!!!+N+The rampant lunacy and blatant buffoonery in this book is such that it should not be read in one sitting.    Genesis 1:1-2:3 The Genesis 1 creation account conflicts with the order of events that are known to science. In Genesis, the earth is created before light and stars, birds and whales before reptiles and insects, and flowering plants before any animals. The true order of events was just the opposite.  God creates light and separates light from darkness, and day from night, on the first day. Yet he didn't make the light producing objects (the sun and the stars) until the fourth day (Gen 1:14-19).  And how could there be "the evening and the morning" on the first day if there was no sun to mark them? Gen 1:3-5 In Genesis 1 the entire creation takes 6 days, but the universe is at least 12 billion years old, with new stars constantly being formed. 1:31.... Let's not fall for "One day in Genesis is not 24hrs but rather a really long period of time" ......Its is stated that "evening and the morning was the first DAY!!!!! Hence, 1 day = 24hrs.   Besides, plants were created BEFORE light, if one day was a long period of time the plants would have died before god got around to creating light.    God curses the serpent. From now on the serpent will crawl on his belly and eat dust. One wonders how he got around before -- by hopping on his tail, perhaps? But snakes don't eat dust, do they? 3:14 "There were giants in the earth in those days." Well, I suppose it's good to know that. But why is there no archaeological evidence for the existence of these giants? 6:4  THE FLOOD Gen 7:20 The flood covered the highest mountain tops (Mount Everest?) with fifteen cubits to spare.....GOOD GRIEF!!!! Every eighth-grader knows that Mount Everest is so high that it has its own weather at its summit.  It could be sunny and calm in the valley but on its peak a swirling snow blizzard.  The atmosphere at the top is so thin it's unbeatable.  Yet good ol' Noah and a boat fill with two of every "kind" of animals bobbing around, floating free with now problems.  I get it!!!! Noah and the gang had individual breathing apparatus for the thin air and sub-zero thermal protection for could.  OR ....Mt. Everest was just a mole hill way back then..... Oh Please!!!!!!!  The flood story was adapted by the Hebrews from an earlier Babylonian myth called the Epic of Gilgamesh which is a lot older than the biblical tale and virtually identical.   Gerald spilled much ink trying to harmonize scientific facts with the Genesis mythology that I cant help wondering who on earth he would reconcile other biblical nonsense such as:   James 5:7 By praying, Elias was able to keep it from raining for three and a half years.  Act 5: 15-16 The sick were healed just by touching the shadow of Peter. Luke 9 39 Epilepsy is caused by devils.  2 Kings 13:21 A dead body is brought to life when it accidentally touches the bones of Elisha.    Be afraid, be very afraid.  This is the sort of trash proposed by creationists for inclusion in our high school science curriculum. ......WHAT PLANET DO WE LIVE ON AGAIN???????                     +books
Child's Play:A Paper Doll Collection+P+The collection is very nice, with a large amount of clothing for the dolls, and hours worth of play time+books
Who is really writing these??+N+I'll be honest, the last three novels have me thinking that Patricia Cornwell has sold off the franchise of her name- the "voice" the writer uses bears no similarity to her other novels, and its very frustrating. Leaves a dedicated reader feeling like she'd been attacked by the pod people or something!  I hold firm to the idea that she hasn't been writing these novels. There is just no way+books
True Colours+N+This is a fine example of a respected intellectual lining up in defense of a difficult-to-justify war and coming out quite convincing.  Of course, to come out quite convincing, Hanson has to resort to some classic and tired old tricks like attacking the protesters of the (then-upcoming Gulf War II), questioning the patriotism of people who dare to question authority, questioning Europe (they can't possibly understand us, he writes, even though we basically came from them), and other howlers.    There are some points here, and some moments where Hanson shows that he may be approaching sense.  This is an educated, intelligent man.  He has notable insights into immigration, and multi-cultural societies, with California (or Mexifornia) as an example of multi-cultural change.  He's very well rounded, and he's not an outright conservative pundit or intellectual.    But too often, I found him repeating what I hear on cable TV, the same old lines, the same old tired arguments about the war on terror.  He loves the anti-American argument.  He thinks people 'don't get it', when they complain about the USA but meanwhile want to act and be like Americans.  There are some points to be made here, but too often I found Hanson comfortably settling into the easy chair to wax on about American greatness and international cluelessness.   I like how he throws out lines like "Second, the Europeans also don't have a clue about America's world role--past, present, or future."  Huh?  I take this to mean that they a) actually don't know any history, or b) don't 'get' our role in history from the American point of view, meaning unconditional support for the world's superpower.  It's funny, of course, considering we as a culture filtered down from Europe.  He settles into a veiled 'love it or leave it' attitude, with the classic, 'why do so many people flock to America?'  I don't think they flock here because they don't like our policy in Iraq, I think they value the freedoms and opportunity available here.  Hanson is either clueless, as is a President who can ask with a straight face, 'why do they hate us?' or he simply knows the answer but...   It's funny, and sad, really, that Hanson, and millions of others still don't seem to 'get it'--namely, that there may actually be a separation between the people, the culture, and values of a country (America) and then the actions of the government abroad and at home.  I guess you can never get enough mileage out of pointing at people and saying 'anti-American'.    By the time you finish the book, if you can, you might wonder whether Hanson himself believes what he's writing, or if he's an outright cynic.  I guess it doesn't really matter in the end, since if he's a good enough writer, then the effect will be the same.  You may agree with much of what he writes, but on the war on terror, on Bush's pipe dream of bringing democracy to the Middle East, well, he's either buying it (with a wink and nudge), or he's honestly hopeful+books
Pitiful At Best+N+I bought this book for .25 cents at a yard sale. Boy did I waste my quarter!   I found NO new meditation techniques in this little rag. It is clear to understand why the sales ranking of this book is only 608,394.   This is your basic, "You know the envision white light garbage and hold your breath to the count of ......". You know the same junk that all charlatons teach.  This book is pitiful at best.+books
Packed with Knowledge!+P+Anyone who wants to grow and improve can benefit from reading John Eliot's book, which teaches you how to develop the power of focused thinking and, thus, to develop yourself in whatever you do. Eliot explains how to use focus to become an exceptional thinker and performer so you can achieve extraordinary things. He believes in following your passion, learning to live in the moment and incorporating some fun into your life and your job. These concepts can help anyone perform better, but they particularly call to those who want to transcend being "average" and to live with passion and purpose. Eliot explains that the human body is physiologically designed to perform exceptionally well under stress. Therefore, he says, don't focus on eliminating stress from your life. Instead, make good use of it. Although Eliot uses numerous examples from sports to illustrate his fundamental principles, readers without a great interest in athletics will still find his stories very interesting, applicable and helpful. Even if this sensible self-help book contradicts some popular self-perfecting advice, it provides a strategy for putting your passions and mental powers to work. We recommend it to those who lead stressful lives - here's how to make stress work for you+books
A Good Book, AGAIN!+P+This is oe of my favorite suspense authors.  I wish she would write faster.  I really have enjoyed all of her books.  They are well written and interesting, exciting stories.  Definitely recommended+books
A fantastic intro to Cortazar+P+Cortazar was one of the more unearthly literary geniuses of the 20th century; like Borges and Nabokov I return to his short stories often (more than a decade after first discovering them), and can still get new things out of them.  I agree with previous reviewers - Cortazar's precision with language rivals Nabokov, Kafka, Proust or Borges.  I would add another comparison as well - though the intent is quite different, the very musical and rhythmic sensuality of the writing also recalls the best of Ferlinghetti - Cortazar is confident enough in his expertise to be willing to play with language in a similar fashion, and creates extraordinary and unforgettable worlds throught this (and other) collections.  This is a great introduction to Cortazar, with many personal favorites: "Night Face Up," "Idol Of The Cyclades," "House Taken Over" and "Axolotl" are all unforgettable short fictions.  I wouldn't stop there - Cortazar's other writing is well worth investigating (especially the second story collection, ALL FIRES THE FIRE).  Cortazar seems to be sliding into unfortunate obscurity as of late, with a number of key works currently out of print.  Thankfully, and for the time being, this is not one of them.  -David Alsto+books
Dry-Augusten Burroughs+P+Great read!  Love all his stuff.  Much of a deeper memoir than "Running with Scissors".  If you enjoyed that book, you will rip through "Dry" in no time.  Currently reading "Possible Side Effects", which is also very good.   Highly recommend this author in general+books
Series hits a brick wall+N+This is the third installment in the Mitch Rapp series and the author's fourth book overall. (I'd suggest reading the previous books both for chronology reasons and that they're better reads.) Mitch is America's #1 "go to" guy when it comes to fighting terrorism. In "Separation of Power" he is faced with cleaning up some open issues from his last mission (someone tried to kill him), the political "in-fighting" surrounding the naming of a new CIA chief, rogue Mossad agents, Iraq gaining nuclear weapons and falling in love. One could be forgiven in thinking this last issue would make for a pleasant diversion while our hero prevents WW III. Not so. Mitch's romance takes a front and center position and in a word is well ... comedic. The "action" threads of the plot - which this author has worked so well in his previous books - is hinted at in the first 100 pages, doesn't really begin until after 200 pages - and then proceeds in fits and starts. There is an inordinate amount of "character development" - self-serving, amoral, scheming politicans & our world weary, battle scarred reluctant hero Mitch, who must once again pick up the sword to do what no other man can do - which like the "romance" impedes the plot. The book hastily concludes, (20+ pages), in an unsatisfying and simplistic finale. Hopefully this book is an anomaly in the series because the author's previous books were great roller coaster rides and provided entertaining reading at the beach and in airports. Unfortunately the much rushed conclusion and Mitch's "new" situation doesn't guarantee that.  +books
A Growing Eve+P+Book #22 in the In Death Series. In this book you have several brutal rapes and murders.  The victims are posed and tied with the same red ribbon.  As no links but basic body type and the red ribbon are found Eve's investigation is tough. Celina Sanchez is a Psychic claiming to have "seen" the murders.  Eve is skeptical, but willing to use any help she can get. As the rapes take their toll on Eve, she finally confides in Peabody her heartbreaking childhood.  It is about time! One of the funniest scenes ever written is when Mavis and Leonardo ask Roarke and Eve to be in the delivery room for the birth of their baby.  I laughed so hard!  It's classic. SPOILER... At one point a key member of Eve's "family" is taken down by the killer.  You feel every blow.  Roarke just couldn't be any better :+books

No pictures+N+My main gripe with this book is that there is not 1 picture.  It makes it really hard to figure out what you are even making+books
Shocked and disgusted+N+I was exposed to this book in what I think is the most unfortunate way possible, it was read to my child in her public school Kindergarten class. I was stunned and emotional when she came home and told me her teacher told her that a candy cane was a J for Jesus, and that the red stripes were his blood, and if she loved Jesus the white would wash it away. My child is five years old, and was disturbed by the whole thing.  This book has no part of the Christmas story in it, and the tasteless metaphor of it is impossible for a young child to understand.  The illustration is graphic and also not age appropriate.  The only good that has come from this absurd destruction of an innocent holiday treat is that now I am even more communicative and vigilant about my child's education and exposure, even in the school I trust with my child's life and well-being+books
The AK of Poker Books+N+It looks pretty, and has shiny pictures, but if you want to learn something new about no limit holdem, this is not the book for you.  This book is filled with Barry's opinion on appropriate ettiquette at a game, money management (nothing specific, just him saying don't blow it - seriously) and is basically his autobiography.  I play online professionally for a living (small stakes) but am developing into a pro.  I would recommend The Theory of Poker - David Sklansky.  Tournament Poker for Advanced Players - David Sklansky.  And of course Super System - 1 or 2 is the same for the NL Holdem section.  I mean no book is going to turn you into a pro, it takes a combination of things, and alot alot of play.  This book will not make you a better poker player, simple as that+books
Best C Reference+P+I used the first edition of Stroustrip's The C Programming Language until it was dog-eared and the binding fell apart.  I'm glad that this edition is hard-backed so I won't wear it out.  C is a complex language and it's impossible to write a program of any size in C without a good reference on your desk.  I have not found any other C reference that is as complete or as useful as this book.  This is not an introduction to C but rather a reference book.  I learned C from Lippman's C Primer but that's on my bookshelf and Stroustrip is on my desk. +books
The start to a series you won't put down.+P+This is the start to a story that will bring every emotion out of you.  The characters, landscapes, different worlds, languages, fantasy, majic all tie in together and create a simply wonderful journey for a reader.  To read this book and the entire story, please keep an open mind, let your imagination runn wild, and remember that this is a story that came out of a writer who struggled with this for 23 years yet he leaves enough for you to decided a lot of things for yourself.  All the loose ends become tied together so keep reading.  But above all read the books for the story not the ending, but I promise you'll be suprised and hopefully as I was, incredibly enlightened. +books
A Tale of One City Would Have Been Plenty+N+Dont buy this book!  Or buy it and tear it in two pieces because it is much to long.  Wow I mean talk about boreing.

Means well, but short, repetitive, and unsubstantial+N+Daniel B. Clendenin's EASTERN ORTHODOXY CHRISTIAN: A Western Perspective seeks to introduce the history and theology of this little-known branch of Christianity to Protestants. An evangelical Protestant, Clendenin became acquainted with Eastern Orthodoxy while teaching at Moscow State University. He is convinced that Protestants and Orthodox have much to learn from each other, and that Protestants should approach the East with a "hermeneutic of love".  The work is divided into seven sections. The first is a general introduction and the second a brief history. The next four sections each deal with an aspect of Orthodox theology unfamiliar or confusing to Protestants. These are the emphasis on apophatic revelation, the use of icons, the relationship of Scripture and Tradition, and theosis. In the final section Clendenin critiques Orthodoxy from his Protestant perspective--dealing frankly with the frequency of nationalism and even racism in Orthodox churches--but nonetheless trying to appreciate its many fine qualities. Clendenin does not have the space to go into much depth on any of these topics, however.  I was not too impressed by the book. Much of the work is repetitive, and in a volume of only 180 pages such repetition makes the work very insubstantial indeed. Clendenin also makes several errors which caused me to doubt his familiarity with the history of the Church. He writes, for example, that the Slavs were converted in 988, when this marked only the conversion of Kyiv Rus and most Slavs were already evangelised over a century earlier. His focus is entirely on the church in Russia and Greece/Byzantium and the contributions of other regions are ignored. The work is written in a journalistic style with frequent resorts to quotations and a great deal of footnotes, suggesting that the author is not terribly specialised in the subject at hand.  For Westerners curious about Orthodoxy, I think there is no better introduction than Kallistos Ware's THE ORTHODOX CHURCH, an instant classic when it was first published over forty years ago, and available in a relatively new updated edition. Clendenin's work is admirable for its attempt to build dialogue between Protestants and Orthodox, but his work is really too short+books
This Hypocrit Actually Hates the Military+N+I already knew that Michael Savage was a draft dodger since I always check the New Hampshire Chickenhawk Database. From some reason they do not have his birthday. According to the official "Name Authority" from the Library of Congress database, his real name is Michael A. Weiner and he was born March 31, 1942. But why is he a hypocrit regarding American soldiers like me?  Dr. Weiner/Savage does the usual butter-me-up, like on page 104. He talks about former Hollywood actors who served in WWII, "True American heroes yes...They, unlike the empty suits of today, fought shoulder-to-shoulder alongside America's finest young boys. The farmers, the steelworkers, the taxi drivers. The people who made this country great." The only problem here is that he is describing MY family and not his.  His image of former soldiers is extremely negative and very offensive to me. In describing a veteran expressing his true feelings about war "war is awful..he never wanted to fight, he didn't believe in fighting although he wore the uniform [what do you mean Weiner?] and yes he was a hero and has many medals even though he naver actually fought." This isn't even the pot calling the kettle black. "Their anti-war comments both undermine our troops' morale and encourage our enemies by creating a picture of a divided front." Weiner also states, "[t]he ill-informed comments of these camera-craving, ex-military types in the attempt to prop-up a sagging self-esteem, do extensive damage to the war on terror and our military." Keep that second comment in mind, but who is the guy with the self-esteem problem? He doesn't have any "fake" medals so who is he to criticize a person who actually served?  If anybody is harming our troops it is Weiner/Savage. On page 88 he actually tells us it is okay for al-Qaida to kill our soldiers. Really. "If you were a leader or an intellectual in the Muslim world and you saw the debauchery promulgated by the West...and saw your young people gravitating toward the filth pumped over your airwaves, what would you do? Frankly you would support al-Qaida or any organization [like al-Qaida in Iraq or the Taliban in Afghanistan?] that would want to stop that flood of pollution from entering your country." Thanks for clearing up why it is okay for these guys to kill our soldiers. And here I thought they just hated our freedoms.   There are other problems with this book. On page 108 he decries the "intense use of drugs." Yeah, like Limbaugh's abuse of Oxycontin that he forgot to mention. Most diturbing to me is his use of words such as "sheeple," which is word coined by racist Aryan Nations members. Why he would use a favorite word of anti-Semites, seeing as how Weiner/Savage is a Jew, as well as a word used extensively by Timothy McVey is quite strange. He also uses dismissive language like "leg-crossers," (page 85)which I assume is a substitute for "bitch." And, finally, for all of you steelworkers, taxi drivers, etc., who are his fans: this guy thinks you're dumb. All you need to do is read page 106 to see what he thinks about opinions of non-college graduates.  As one last snipe on this guy, I just love that photo of him (all photos are of him) in the book, under the line "my ship has come in." That is one big yacht he is at the helm of. To his question of where to steer his yacht, how about towards the Gulf and to join the fight? I did ny combat, now you do yours.+books
Read because it considered a classic+N+The book is written about an empire in the future.  I'm not really sure why Asimov thought that the future galaxy would be ruled by an emporer, which is a dying system of government, instead of a democratic republic.  I know this is nit-picking, but I didn't like this book.    Apparently, the future can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy using math and statistics.  Anyone who works as a mathematician or statistician, as I do, knows that it's difficult to predict what's going to happen in anyone's life tomorrow, much less the entire world 500 to 1000 years into the future using statistics.  This book is intellectual worship, which is something I can't stand.  Intellectual worship is when people think they are intellecually superior to everyone else, so feel they should rule over everyone else, if only you would listen to them.  This idea drips off the page as event after event is predicted by some really smart dude.  This smart dude predicted a collapse of civilization and treated it as inevitable.  Another idea that's patently absurd- that any event that occurs is inevitable.  If this guy was so smart as to predict, with a high degree of accuracy, the downfall of civilization, and the rising of a new one, along with the traumatic events this new civilization would go through, why wasn't he smart enough to avert the downfall of the original civilization.  Surely, with his predictive ability people would listen to him, but he decides to let it crumble for whatever reason.  And Asimov is a mediocre writer.  The story is only moderately interesting because no character really gets developed.  I read this book because as a sci-fi fan, I felt obligated+books
Ramblings of a dirty old man.+N+Heinlein is a great author.  When he sits back and tells a story, he's one of the best.  Glory Road and Citizen of the Galaxy are wonderful, and The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress should be on the shelf of any science fiction fan.  This, however, is an awful book.  It's not merely one of Heinlein's worst.  It's one of the worst books I've ever had the misfortune to read.  The problem isn't that there's no action, although there isn't.  The problem is that there isn't anything of substance to replace it.  There's lots of sex, but not in enough detail to be titilating.  There isn't a love story either; you can't have romance or sexual tension when your characters will sleep with anyone and everyone for any reason.  The book just rambles aimlessly until it ends.  Maybe Heinlein was trying for an examination of gender roles and sexual identity, but if so he failed miserably.  The characters in this book aren't just from a different culture; they aren't people at all.  They're too flat.  If you want to think about such things, ponder them on your own or read a different book.  I suggest Left Hand Of Darkness by Ursula Le Guin.  I Will Fear No Evil reads like an old man's rambling personal fantasies.  Someone must like it, but I can't recommend it even to the most devoted Heinlein fans.  If you're tempted, do yourself a favor and re-read Stranger In A Strange Land instead+books

Very Disappointed+N+I was really disappointed especially because I had read so many positive reviews of the book. It very boring and the only exercises there actually were was one little chapter. The book was more of an autobigraphy of the author as well as about the history of the acceptance of women's masturbation which I could have read online if i wanted to. I wouldn't consider this a self-help book at all. +books
Dare, if you will, to read...+P+This is a beautiful book addressing complex and dynamic elements of parenting. The writing is sweet, dramatic, sensual and educated. It dares to be politically incorrect and encourages a return to intimate mothering that has been lost via feminism and day care. As a new mom, I was overwhelmed with feelings of intimacy for my baby son...I had no idea. I read the chapters, underlined, and tearfully re-read the moving paragraphs to my husband when he got home at night. Oxenhandler succinctly captures the power of a child's love for his momma, the smiles that light up a parent's heart, as well as the darker side of sensuality between parent and child. It is a well-researched, albeit brave and scary, text+books
Harlequin Presents...Nicholas Sparks+N+While easy enough to read, if the exact same pages were enclosed in a Harlequin Romance cover, I wouldn't know the difference.  I'm extremely surprised this is a "best seller". Maybe I should take up writing because I can't possibly be worse than this.  Ok, it's a good enough story but wow, it's predictible and boring. I read it completely in 2 days, and I'm a reader that savors pages so it takes me a while. I wasn't intrigued, I wasn't on the edge of my seat, and didn't shed a tear+books
Great book when it isn't a text book+P+The Forensic Files of Batman is about an equal mix of good and bad. When the book is telling a story where Batman uses forensic science it is amazing. When the book just spins its wheels about forensics it feels like Moench has just been cutting and pasting out of a text book.  The book is organized as different journals written by Batman, a young Bruce Wayne, Alfred and Jim Gordon. The Batman stories are well written with a great balance of science and story. Not only are these stories great, but the final story of the book is also one of the best Batman stories ever told. The young Bruce Wayne stories are the most informative, but all they do is educate with no story. They are just lists or long winded passages about forensics. They also have a childish tone that matches Bruce's age, but not of the overall book. The Alfred and Gordon chapters are great. Each of them allows the reader to watch Batman work without being in his head and make very interesting additions.   Overall, when this book is doing what it should it is great. It allows Batman to fight crime with just his brain and really shows that he has earned the title detective. +books
Waste of time+N+I wasted time reading this book that I will never get back.  It was repetitive, predictable, and drawn out.  I only finished the book hoping for a twist in the ending, but it turned out the way I thought it would.  Buy this book if you want to feel good about yourself for finishing it quickly, and for predicting how the story goes.  But, I would not waste the time if I were you+books

DON"T WASTE YOUR TIME+N+This book really is an insult.  It's "lesson" and "assignments" are HORRIBLE.  They ask you to research in magazines different lighting effects that you think were used in his book.  In a field where doing is truly the best learning experience this book is not worth the paper it was printed on.  Check it out from a library if you must but you will shortly find it is an insulting read+books
The best place to start to learn about castle life+P+This book is absolutely the best place to start if you want to learn about medieval castles.  It explains in very accessable prose how medieval castles came to be, how they evolved, the roles they served in medieval society, what they were like at their zenith, how military strategy through the middle ages centered around the castle, and how their relevance declined with the changes in technology and the political scene that came with the late medieval period.  The Gieses give the reader a very clear picture of what life was like for the people whose lives centered in or around the castle, from the nobility at the top down through the staff needed to keep the castle running to the villagers at the bottom. In particular, it shows the various functions that the castle staff needed to serve in order to keep things running smoothly, and the duties of those responsible for those functions, from chamberlains, chaplains, seneschals and stewards down to pantlers, haywards and reeves.  In many cases, the best things are the historical anecdotes used to show a particular aspect of castle life, from the manner in which meals were served to the ways provisions were acquired in an era where money was by no means a common exchange, and how matters of jurisdiction often overlapped in problematic ways (a lord might have jurisdiction over a castle but not over the forest surrounding it which belonged to the king).  This is not what I would call the definitive text on all aspects of castle lore, but it is probably the single best place to start to get a clear and detailed education on, as the title indicates, "life in a medieval castle."+books

Brave Man+P+What can I say about Ernie Pyle?  One of the most well-known correspondents in WWII, he wrote with an empathy for the common infantryman that transcended his simple, eloquent prose.  "Brave Men" is a collection of the articles he wrote while covering the war in Sicily, Italy, England, and France.  Exceedingly modest, Pyle always downplayed his role while extolling the infantry fighting on the front lines, his beloved "dogfaces."  Pyle may not have thought that he was doing anything of importance, yet his articles served to bring the war home to an American public that was being fed a somewhat sugar coated version of the war by the government; in turn, the GI's loved Pyle as one of their own.  He immortalized as many of them as he could in his articles, stating the names of the many men with whom he had contact, and often their full home address for good measure.  He shared many of their hardships on the front lines, and now, more than 60 years later, his articles offer an insight into WWII for today's readers that is as poignant now as it was then.  He makes the reader feel as if we know these men personally-they are our fathers, grandfathers, brothers, neighbors, friends. Impossible to put down, this book is the enduring legacy of a great man whose life ended much too soon (after surviving the European theater, he traveled to the Pacific at the request of the Navy, where a Japanese sniper took his life on the tiny island of Ie Shima, just off the coast of Okinawa); I would recommend this book to everyone I know with an interest in WWII+books
Great book!+P+Regardless of some of the negative reviews I found that this book contains some of the best advice you can get about internet marketing.  Some have their opinions about his book about "how to get rich by telling other people how to get rich." Although that has some truth to it, there is so much more to it - if you think of how to apply it in your industry or niche!  What some of these reviewers fail to understand is that this book gives you the strategies on how to market your particular business effectively through using the internet, NOT just "teaching people how to get rich."  And the subtitle to this book accurately says it all, "making money online using e-mail" In my opinion that's what this book is about and is accurately communicated in the title.  I highly recommend this book to anybody who wants to start an online business.  Although you could get most of the material for free on the internet, it's much more convenient and saves you A LOT of time to have this book around.  +books
Mr. Fitzhugh is One Of A Kind!+P+If you're looking for the outrageous, eccentric, with a laugh in at least every paragraph, you just can't beat Bill Fitzhugh! Plus , his books are great satires on contempary America. CROSS DRESSING is perhaps his most realistic, with no sci- fi overtones such as those found in PEST CONTROL, an even wilder ride! Here we have a socially aware nun with an unusual past, meeting up with an ad huckster in some of the funniest scenes ever written, yet everything here is certainly very possible, if not likely. His barbs at organized religion, and the huckster consumer society are all too real! Truly, Mr Fitzhugh strikes a solid punch, and one wishes for more success for this unique, zanily- inspired author+books
Upward Mobility+P+"Undine was fiercely independent and yet passionately imitative.  She wanted to surprise every one by her dash and originality, but she could not help modeling herself on the last person she met, and the confusion of ideals thus produced caused her much perturbation when she had to choose between two courses." p.457  The characters in Custom of the Country were fabulous, especially Elmer Moffatt.  The story itself proved to be an almost inexhaustible weave of aspirations and setbacks.  The up-and-coming young New York socialite, Undine Spragg, with her country background and concealed past, pushes incessantly to better her personal station.  Whether it is compromising her parents financial stability to marry into New York's society, crushing her first husband in favor of a richer more social benefactor, or finding her way into a scandalous second marriage with one of France's oldest families, Undine never stops aspiring for more.  She ultimately concludes (seemingly so) with her very first love, Elmer Moffatt.  Wharton leaves the reader with an unpredictable and winding path, to an inevitable conclusion+books
ENJOYED IT THEN AND JUST ENJOYED IT AGAIN!+P+I read this one for the first time in 1959, a year after it was published. This story has never left me.  For some reasone it left quite an impression.  Recently I ran across a copy at a book sale and purchased it, took it home and read it again.  I now know why it has stayed with me all these year!  It is good!  I have, over the years read quite a number of Heinlein's works and I must admit that this is probably my favorite of the bunch.  I realize that it is considered a juvenile book and it is certainly an appropriate read for the younger reader, but, as I just found out, it is quite a nice read for the older reader also.  As I remember, looking back, this book rather inspired me in many ways, and doing better in school was by no means the least.  Some of Heinlein's later work was rather difficult for me to digest, i.e. I simply did not like them.  I rather wish he had stuck to simply telling well told tales as he did with this one.  Recommend this one highly.+books
&quot; A genius between 'action' and 'cut' &quot;+P+This book is a brilliant recreation of the personality of a conflicted genius. Drunk, boor, loyal friend, egotist,poor father, generous benefactor, are all labels that could apply to John Ford. This biography verifies a lot of great stories and illuminates the secrets of the man. Any fan of film cannot afford to miss this work. Henry Fonda says Ford was &quot; a son of a bitch...but a genius.&quot; You will agree+books
Use your time wisely - avoid this book+N+Filling a book with applications is no good when you compress the theoretical material. This book, although nice on the application side, falls short when the going starts to get rough. This book has chapters that are not even worth reading, like the chapter on Eigenvectors and Linear Transformations. In general, the explanations are so short or lack demonstrations to a point where you end up memorizing theorems (a demonstration is not a paragraph in cursory English saying "blah, blah, as we saw previously, blah, blah, blah." If you doubt me, do that on an exam and see what the professor writes in red ink, later). Is that what you want ? The serious student will then waste his/her precious little time trying to fill in the gaps with other books. I'm not even talking from the standpoint of abstractness and rigour. I'm just saying explanations are lacking.  A reviewer said some problems are hard to do with the text, and 98% are done by rote. This is correct. The "hard" problems are hard because the book is lacking in abstraction. Another reviewer said this book will please engineers more than mathematicians. I feel this is correct too. Applied mathematics students should also avoid this book. I don't think this book prepares you for "the next level", where you'll be working with real problems. I don't see this book preparing the student for computational linear algebra, and I don't think there's nearly enough matrix theory here. Also, I think the book has that American textbook style where things are broken into small pieces and fit into nice-looking boxes and the text tends to loose its flow and you tend to loose the conections. It's not a good writing style for my taste. It's kind of like a Calculus book. They lie to you first, and then they teach you "Advanced Calculus" and "Analysis." Personally, I don't like that approach, because I think it's a time waster. And, you might not get a second chance to ge it right as an undergraduate (this is true for engineering students at my institution). Quickly immerse yourself in "Matrix Analysis and Applied Linear Algebra" by C. D. Meyer and avoid this book; or, another great book (and everybody says so, because it is), Gilbert Strang's "Linear Algebra and Its Applications." The virtues I see on this book are carefully chosen illustrations that help to convey meaning to the theorems by geometric aid and the intertwined applications "appetizers."  All in all, though, it'll do you more harm than good. Students who enjoyed this book have probably haven't read any other. This review refers to the 2nd edition+books
he knows what he's talking about+P+In the spring semester of 2004, Mr. Rubinstein was my trigonometry teacher.  For those of you in New York state, that's the equivalent of the last term of Sequential Math III or the last term of the Math B curriculum.  Being a tenth grader at the time, I found his methods of teaching to be one of the best.  Not only did I enjoy being a student in his class, but I also enjoyed learning math and because of him, I continued to pursue advanced math classes.  When he made a mistake, he was never afraid to let us correct him.  He is a humble man and is able to connect with his students on a personal level.  There was never anything fake about him.  Now that I am a senior in Stuyvesant HS, I look back and see that I never had a math teacher, or teacher of any subject, quite like Mr. Rubinstein.  There are only a few teachers like him and I feel lucky to have been taught by him.  If his book is anything like the way he teaches, then many people will learn from him by reading this book+books
Educational Food Choices+P+This book is excellent for anyone who is tracking their food intake, whether you're on a diet to loose weight or a special diet for health reasons.

Surprising details that help you make informed decisions about what you eat+books

Didn't even finish!+N+I love Linda Howard, but I didn't even finish reading this book because it was so boring and annoying!  The heroine was a whiny martyr--she drove me crazy!  And where was the suspense?  I truly can't believe that people liked this book!  If you want to read a good Linda Howard book, read "Mr. Perfect" or "Dying to Please"+books
Officially Professional+P+I love this book.  I received it and refer to it often.  I tell all my friends, especially those who show interest in wanting to change their lives.  Its probably the last "self-help" book on the subject I will ever buy and I have bought many "manifestation", create-what-you-desire type of books.  Its simply amazing.  Thaaaaaaank You+books
Very poorly written+N+I don't have much to say that hasn't already been said, but I felt it important enough to pipe in and agree with most of the negative comments. The book is unnecessarily complicated, skips non-obvious steps in the examples, provides no review for material that justifiably should be reviewed, and has a very poor approach to explanation of concepts. Contrasted to James Stewart's Calculus book that I've used for the past year, this book almost makes me want to cry and turn into an English major. The key to surviving a class that requires this book is to get another book. I'm a Berkeley student, for whatever that's worth+books
the worst of them all+N+Huge disappointment. Trace wasn't that good either. Having read all Scarpetta's previous storiesbut I was hoping Trace would be only bad one. However, the downhill trend seems to continue. These two books are not the usual intelligent plots Cornwell is capable of writing. Save your money, don't buy it. I completely agree with all the reviews posted so far, so I won't go into the plot -or rather lack of a real plot -details+books
Is Feminism the F Word?+P+I assign this book to students in my psychology seminar.  These students at a women's college tell me that they find Women and Desire to be thought provoking, interesting, even helpful.  I noticed a column in Newsweek by Anna Quindlen in October.  She argued that women today still need the F word feminism because society hasn't changed as much as we like to tell ourselves.  It appears that the need for books such as this one by Polly Young-Eisendrath continues to be valid+books
illuminating+P+This has helpful stuff in it. I even went out and bought a stopwatch to time certain tasks to speed myself up, as this book recommends. But the time obsession is kind of ridiculous at times, to the point where you almost expect Mr. McCormack to say, &quot;If you could shave making love to your wife from 15 minutes down to 15 seconds, you'd save so much time.&quot; To get philosophical, Abraham Maslow wrote the seminal book TOWARD A PSYCHOLOGY OF BEING where he writes of the &quot;self-actualized&quot; personality, that he considers the most highly evolved personality type, but who are less than 1% of the population. One common trait amongst these extremely happy people is they often experience &quot;peak experiences&quot; where they feel immense joy and these experiences &quot;trascend time.&quot; These people lose track of time during these experiences!!!! Now, it seems an obsession with time such as McCormack preaches would completely interfere with one's ever having such joyful experiences. I suppose it's like a lousy movie, where you are always looking at your watch, versus a great movie, where you forget about everything but the movie. So, I suppose to be successful and efficient, you have to say good-bye to happiness in a big way. But it's success that is supposed to make you happy, right? A major contradiction!+books
Utopia deja-vu, all over again.+N+Apparently the difference between a criminal act (theft) and moral redistribution of income is 1) who you steal from (stealing from the wealthy, of course, is moral -- according to Rawls and Bolsheviks), and 2) who receives the loot (the non-wealthy makes it moral), and 3) who commits the act (the state/society, of course also makes theft moral; example - taxation), and 4) your intentions (redistribution of income). To look at this another way, if your neighbor breaks into your house and steals your money, that's a crime (unless your neighbor is poor -- which would then be moral and Justice, according to Rawls' formula). If the community comes into your house and steals from you, it's legal and moral Justice, again, according to Rawls. Because, according to Rawls, if, before you were born, you were to vote with everyone on how physical world society should be structured, you'd vote to have the state guarantee that everyone was equal, or they would be compensated somehow for being born (unjustly) less-equal. How? By compensating those with less by stealing from those with more. So those with more would be like oh, say ... a milk-cow who gets milked to serve those with less. So those with more would become a resource, or state-owned slaves to those with less ... because "society" (the Robin Hoods and Rawls of the world) deemed this as moral Justice. Rawls does not take into account those who are willing to take on risk, entrepreneurs, students of life who work to earn an "A" vs. students who earn an "F". He points out that many people are born into difficult situations through no fault of their own. True. But that does not implicate those within society who are born into better situations as the cause, nor are those who are born into better situations responsible for making up the difference. Forcing the "wealthier" ones to be accountable for the unfairness within life and pay the bill isn't Justice or moral. It would simply be an unjust law. Some people see Rawls' theory as a blueprint for a future generation utopia (like the Bolsheviks envisioned Marxism). I see it as an insane blueprint for slavery, and a powerful dis-incentive for earning personal reward and merit. In a sense, this book is an argument against the individual. It sees the world through a blurred lense where the author only recognizes masses of people -- he doesn't recognize any individuals (unless they were born as victims). Curious. How do you experience life ... as a group-mind (an oxymoron if there ever was one), a collective? Or as a unique, isolated, independent, individual? There should be societal incentives to help each other. Okay. But when it is forced (theft of property always implies force), it is no longer an issue of morality or justice -- it's simply a law. Without personal choice being involved there is no morality as an issue, by definition. Transforming advantaged individuals into mules forced to carry the burdens of the world is a definition of justice for whom?  +books
Disappointing+N+Overall, I was not impressed by this rambling and disjointed book although Ferguson makes some interesting points. The book is background to a British TV series involving Ferguson, and it suffers very much from being written for that format.      His basic argument is that the great wars of the 20th Century tore apart the great multi-ethnic empires of Great Britain, Russia, Turkey, Austria-Hungary, and Germany, unleashed ethnic tensions the empires had contained. This, he explains, is the reason for a lot of the violence of the century, as new nation states sorted out their ethnic identities with large-scale organized violence following.      This is, indeed, a very fertile field and Ferguson unearths the mass graves with relish. We are presented with the familiar parade of horribles -- Kaiser Bill, Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot, etc., and a huge section on the pogroms against the Jews in central Europe and the Nazi extermination efforts. The narrative tends to jump around quite a bit, something I would attribute to the TV format of keeping viewers interested, but it's a little disconcerting for armchair readers.      But in the end, Ferguson is unconvincing. I don't think he has fully thought through his thesis here. Unexplored is the question of why some 20th Century wars of liberation, for example Ireland's, had low death rates, while the establishment of others like Turkey were so murderous. There were bitter ancient ethnic and religious issues in both Ireland and Turkey, and yet both took different routes. Also ignored are instances where threatened ethnic wars were largely averted, as in the case of Canada after the British Empire collapsed, and Indonesia after the Dutch withdrew.      I found him also fighting a straw man. He beats down the theory that the wars involved class conflict, and insists ethnic divisions are more significant in explaining the carnage than class. Perhaps Soviet historians presented this view, but I thought 1989 resolved the debate about Marxist interpretations of history.      Which brings up a final point. Ferguson muses about why the last decade of the 20th Century should be so quiet, compared to all that happened. I might think that the collapse of the Soviet empire resolved the last issue of the wars of the 20th Century by declaring another big loser.            +books
Life Changer+P+This book will change your life and awaken you to the life God has called you to. Fluent and well-written, this book is sure to inspire you.+books
Really bad ending+N+I liked this book up until the ending.  I expected the judges to be released and taken care of one by one which would have been predictable (it's what I thought was going to happen), but at least satisfying and believable considering the power Grisham gave the CIA throughout this entire book.  Instead, the ending was quite disappointing and pretty much ruined the book for me+books
A pretentious slog+N+I'm sure that somewhere in this book there is a story, but it wasn't worth the cost of finding it.  Started reading this and got 100 pages into it before saying enough with all the obscure references, historical meanderings, and pointless speculations.  Seems like this book's real purpose is to test the reader's intellectual bona fides rather than to present a well written, intriguing story.  It was a slog and people who want to give it great ratings, I think, do so because they're afraid people will think them stupid if they tell the truth.  Call me stupid then, but this book needed a good editor and someone to tell this pretentious author to move the story along once in a while and lighten up on the obscure/pointless ramblings. My congratulations to those who managed to get to the end of this 533 page snooze fest.  You have my admiration for your tenacity.  I note that people usually rate one or two star reviews as unhelpful.  But take a look at lots of reviews of this book.  The majority of them say it is a long, boring slog, then they give it a 3 star rating.  How helpful is that? +books
A Critical Indictment of High School History Texts+N+James Loewen's "Lies" is a valuable tool, debunking myths and misconceptions-even unearthing causation for common historical misconceptions. Where this critcal work fails, though, is in understanding the purpose for teaching history- for students to understand and affirm American institutions. Loewen's praise of a figure like John Brown does nothing to further this end. I do not believe, as the author does, that history as taught today is propaganda, but I do agree that textbooks are written to serve a purpose, and this being a capitalistic society, they are also written for consumers.   I am particularly irritated at his continuing the present trend of Christopher Columbus bashing. It serves no interests to villify Columbus in the name of historical accuracy. All who have immigrated here owe him a debt regardless of his alleged crimes against humanity. Loewen rails on about the "exploitative" element in Columbus's story, but his personal bias is likewise present in his support for African discovery and claims of racially motivated historiographical discrimination. Similarly, his accusation of Lincoln as a racist violates the historical principle of judging the past through the prism of the present. It is a fallacy which needs context to be properly examined. Both the author and I agree that history is written by the victors, so why does Loewen rehash this ad nausem?  Loewen asks the question, "How is one supposed to feel about the America that has been presented?" My answer after reading his book is, overwhelmingly negative and cynical. His criticism of texts, as well as all modern scholarship revising previous inaccuracies, must be taken into account in teaching history, but his negative tone must be balanced. Students do need to become, in Loewen's words, "crap detectors." Students should be given the tools to analyze events and formulate reasonable conclusions, on that much I think we would agree+books

A new effective look on the abramelin operation+P+The book delivers what it promises: a modern look on the abramelin operation and the possible procedures involved in obtaining the so called knowledge and conversation with your Holy Guardian Angel, samadhi, or whatever your label of choice is for this ineffable experience you are after. Just like "The New Hermetics" (another title by the same author which I sincerely recommend for those with an interest in magick and/or NLP...and how big is the difference between the two after all?), 21st Century Mage keeps an eye on the past and tradition, while at the same time cutting through whatever may be superfluous, and keeping a very effective, non-dogmatic, outcome-oriented attitude. If you have a general interest for the abramelin operation and are after a good read, or if you are looking for the book that finally makes it sound feasible, explains how, and spurs you to seriously invest your time to DO IT, 21st Centruy Mage definitely has its place on your bookshelf+books

Waste of money+N+As a beginning blogger, I was disappointed with this book.  I generally like the Dummies series and have found them useful and entertaining.  This one is not.  The author is sarcastic -p. 3 "What You're Not to Read - I forbid you to read trashy novels from the supermarket."  Really!  The information on Blogger doesn't add anything that can't be found on Blogger help screens.  Several blogging services, for example Edublog, are not mentioned at all.  Last, The Part of Tens was not as neat as in most of the Dummies books.  I want my money back+books
Absolutely superb work - a must have for Eastern Front buffs!  +P+This book is of the highest quality, from its hard cover, to its glossy pages, to the photographs and historical records. This is the most detailed account of urban warfare in Stalingrad I have ever read. The book is fast-paced, easy to follow, thoroughly researched, and extremely informative. I could not put this book down and learned more about the streetfighting in Stalingrad than from all the other books I have read combined. If you want to learn about the horrific fighting in Stalingrad from a first-person perspective, this is the highest quality work I have encountered. I recommend it to anyone with an interest on the subject and can assure you that you will not be disappointed. A first class historical work all the way. Impressive!   (On a side note, I specifically looked for the author emphasizing that he was only doing his job and only found one reference. So, I have to respectfully disagree with the other reviewer who stated that this was a repeat issue.+books
Go get The Past Through Tomorrow+N+This collection consists mostly of the last stories in the Past Through Tomorrow.  PTT may well be one of Heinein's masterworks, a collection of short stories that retells history from the late 1890's but puts the world on a different course. By lopping off the last few short stories, this collection looses the continuity that made the PTT a great read. . +books
Cute but no substance+N+This book is more of a magazine (with advertisements!).  While it has many cute pages that parents have made with a photo or two, the descriptions of how each page was done are only useful for people who have enough scrapbooking experience to recognize the brief and sometimes obscure references to paper and lettering sources.  There are almost no explanations of how the pages were created (no step by step instructions or tips or anything) except to identify the sources of the products used.  A big disappointment+books
Roosevelt's Place in History+P+While prior reviews have criticized Mr. Roosevelt's writing style, and justly so, he never claimed in the book to be a novelist by trade.  But his description of the way the military operated before the turn of the century is very insightful into a time long gone which will never return.  Today, there is no way the US Military would accept civilian volunteers with only 30 days training to fight on the front lines against battle hardened soldiers from Spain or anywhere else.  To fully appreciate this book, you need to read it in context of that changing time between the Civil War and WW-I.  Indeed, the way the US Military accepted back into its ranks former Confederate Officers was almost a shock to read, but understandable given the desire for the nation to heal its wounds after the Civil War.  For those individuals who appreciate learning history from participants instead of modern, revisionist historians who have never spent a day in the military, I would highly recommend this book.  This book is one I'll read again+books
pretentious garbage+N+i tried reading it, and made it about 3-4 pages.  i'm pretty sure that's a bad sign.  i seem to recall mr. sedaris writing about his mother's bedpan or something.  the impression i instantly got was "BEEP BEEP!

Was this a novel or a horticulture manual?+N+The prologue of this book lead me to believe this was going to be a very touching love story of a woman losing the love of her life and finding love again.  I was disappointed, soon after, when it turned into a gardening manual and a tale about ghosts, with a sort of haphazard romance thrown in the middle-and then even that was disappointing.  I mean Graceland for a first date?  I noticed a lot of similarities between Roz and the mayor in Northern Lights, and Logan and Nate from that same book.  None of them can talk in complete sentences.  And Stella, who comes across as this loving mother, who puts her kids before anything else, works from sun up to sun down and is so smug that she thinks the whole business is going to come crashing down around everybody if she isn't there to oversee everything, even though the place has been successful for years.  There is no addressing the issue of moving on with her life after the death of her husband, she just does it. Unless, of course, it was in the last 50 pages which I didn't bother to read because I just couldn't torture myself any longer.  And I'm a big fan of Roberts.  I love her Quinn brothers books and a lot of her other work.  But this just stunk because I could really care less who the ghost is going to turn out to be.  I'm certainly not going to suffer through the last two books to find out.+books
Not one of Patterson's better novels+N+This novel highly disappointed me and I'm a big James Patterson fan. The usual short chapters don't bother me, but this novel was running over with characters...okay...so I don't like too many characters that I have to remember. But I stayed with the book and when it came to the ending, I kept telling myself...NO WAY. But, it ended the way it ended. I purchased this one, but I think maybe I'll get the next Patterson release from the library. I think the two star rating pretty well sums it up+books
a history text+N+Okay- I know that this is a seminal work re: the Middle East, but it is as dry as any other history text that you might find on the shelves of MiddleEast 101.  In comparison to Price of Honor or other more reader friendly texts that in my opinion carry as much critical information about the volatile region, it pales in comparison+books
A Must Read as We Enter WW III+P+Being a child of the self indulgent baby-boomer generation this book shook me to my roots, not only by how different things were then but by how similar they are now.  As I read this book I couldn't help but be amazed by how the characters, whether on a personal or a societal scale, mirrored those we see today.  Most of all Herman Wouk provides a crystal clear view of the events leading up to WW II. The characters are memorable, though I feel that this is Wouk's shortcoming in this book. The historical characters seem to be developed more strongly than the fictional characters of the Henry family, around which this book centers. I feel that Wouk left the main characters purposely undefined as a way to make them appear more complex. The historic characters didn't suffer from this, perhaps because Wouk had to rely on historical accounts of them.  This books seems to hold up well for historical accuracy and provides an incomparable sense of perspective for anyone wishing to learn more than just the facts of that era.  I prefer to read classics and believe this book might be easy to trash on that level but the story itself and the realism with which Wouk tells it makes this one of the very best books I have read to date.   This is an imoprtant book that should be read by everyone wishing to understand the events leading up to World War II. It can happen again and as I write this in late 2005 it seems likely it will.+books
Extremely valuable both as a parenting resource and as a professional sourcebook of general understanding+P+Breaking Through To Teens: A New Psychotherapy For The New Adolescence is a cutting-edge psychology book by award-winning academic author Ron Taffel, Ph.D., founder of Family and Couples Treatment Services at The Institute for Contemporary Psychotherapy in New York City. Breaking Through To Teens blends crucial insights into teen culture with the hard-earned knowledge of what can get through to the troubled adolescents of today's world. From the basic conditions kids need to feel "held", to clear means for breaking through parent-teen gridlock, to creating "flexible confidentiality", and getting teens to speak up, Breaking Through To Teens is extremely valuable both as a parenting resource and as a professional sourcebook of general understanding and specific techniques for youth psychologists and family counselors. Highly recommended especially for psychology reference shelves.+books
Beauty and the Beast+P+So lush and rich and vivid; and yet sullied by racism.  What a tragedy that icredibly beautiful writing like this is now compromised by sensitivities that Wolfe did not perceive.  A flaw that should be forgiven and yet is so difficult to do when confronted with the ugly racism of some passages.  However, if one can forgive, Wolfe is without doubt the greatest American writer+books
Harry Rocks+P+These are truly a wonderful grouping of books that everyone should read if not own. I loved the movies and couldn't keep waiting to find out what happens, so bought the books. Read them all 1-6 in about 6 days...just couldn't put them down. Lighthearted reading that is enjoyable+books
The Amazing Power of Drivel+N+As a university professor of human resource development and an Anglican brother, The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent is pure drivel and has no redeeming value whatsoever. If you enjoy new-age fantasy, get a copy from your local library otherwise do not waste your money. If you are serious about spiritual growth you might read works such as The Rule of Benedict: Insights for the Ages, or the best selling book on spiritual development of all time.. it's called the Bible+books
Groomers beware+N+This is an ok book for new people, but it has several safty issues, and doesn't have the show cuts for many dogs, poodles. It also has the wrong cuts from some of the dogs. There are better books out there+books
A Banal and Brainlessly Belligerent Buffoon+N+I read parts of this "book" until my intelligence was thoroughly insulted and I immediately returned it to the library. What a stultifying simpleton this man is. He is someone who wants to appear to have all the answers without having any foundation of intelligent ideas. And unsurprisngly, this dolt absolutely embarrassed himself during a recent appearance on the "David Letterman Show" and what made matters worse was just how oblivious he was to his infinite stupidity. First, he claimed that no one should criticize President Bush "because we're at war and it's no good for the country." Come again? I say that such a statement is "no good" for democracy, which is something this submental gasbag has forgotten about. The right to openly disagree with an alderman or a president is guaranteed by the First Amendment. And this man is a graduate of the John F. Kennedy School of Government? Also, he insisted that Cindy Sheehan, whose son was killed in Iraq, not have the right to be publicly upset with President Bush and the invasion of Iraq because "she's connected with left-wing elements in this country." What left-wing elements? I feel that Cindy Sheehan is as connected to left-wing elements as much as Bill O'Reilly is associated with logical reasoning.+books
Not for the squeamish+N+Although fantasies were given by &quot;regular&quot; people, I found the descriptions of making it with dogs and dreaming of what you'd do to your baby neice, not only objectionable, but just plain gross. I don't think your average person would appreciate such fantasies. Based on other  reviewers here, I thought it would be about really erotic/possibly romantic  escaapades. I had no idea it would be bizarre and ugly. I think there were  2 I liked, but they were just so-so. I wonder about an author that provides  a forum for such material+books
Pretty poor effort+N+I'm a long time fan of the Anna Pigeon mysteries, and have read all the others. Unfortunately, "Hard Truth" does not live up to the quality of Ms. Barr's earlier works. It feels very contrived. It also appears to take advantage of stereotypes against religious groups. This book just does not meet the expectations I've come to expect from the series.+books
The Portrait Photographer's Guide to Posing+P+Right on time as usually. The product is what I expecte+books
Good CCNA book, but don't let it be your only one...+P+This is a very indepth library for an aspiring CCNA. These books are packed full of entry-level Cisco and networking knowledge. However, do not rely on these books alone to pass the CCNA. Be sure to pick up Todd Lammle's CCNA book to prepare you for the test+books
My first Dicken's experience+P+One word of caution to people about this book.  There are many abridged versions out there so be careful to find one that is not.  I originally picked up one at a used book sale, got it home and was astonished to find that it had only 400pp.  I thought this was odd, so I searched about on the internet and realized that others were over 1000pp. long.  Needless to say, I went out and found an unabridged version to read.  Thankfully I realized my mistake early on.  As far as the story itself goes, I was pleased with my first experience with Dickens.  I like a good 19th century novel filled with the ornate language and customs of the day.  I very much liked Dicken's overtly satirical and even subtly derisive way of writing about issues like courts and aristocracy.  Even after almost 150 years, his views still ring true.    I look forward to reading more of his books.  +books
Snarky not funny+N+Bryson is a pretty good writer. His prose is flowing and very easy to read. This book is 300 pages and I read it in 3 days.   My complaint is his lousy attitude toward people. He made fun of just about everyone but gave his most scathing comments to overweight woman. Plus, this is a book about traveling across America. I don't mind Americans complaining about what's wrong here. I do it myself occasionally. I don't mind people in other countries criticizing the USA. I make judgments about other countries, some unflattering. But there is something grating about Americans living in other countries coming back to travel the USA and taking potshots at our way of life and poking fun at the working poor. Stay in England if it's so bad here+books
Worset movie ever+N+I can't stand this movie, it's one of the worset.   The acting is horrible, it's dark, gloomy, and so boring. It's fun to watch and make fun of it, but thats about all. I do not recommend it, I would give it zero stars if it was possible.   The child actress "mary" and then the older grown up "mary" actress isn't suitable, she doesn't even look like she could have been the same person or type, how awful! Watch another version, this one is a waste of time and money!+books
Smartly written, unique story, but not for me +N+I did not enjoy this book at all because it was writen in a very distracting fashion.  While it was unique, it was too hard to get into.  I also really hated the story, it was also too confusing to follow, to strange to enjoy, and to boring to care.  I totally hated this book and it was near torture and a waste of time to read.  The only reason that I read this was because it was for my book club.  The reivews, by the way, in the club were 50/50.  Some loved it, the rest of us hated it.  There was no in-between.  I would only recommend this book to someone who is into odd literature or to English majors, I'm not sure who else would like it+books
Great story+P+This book isn't a masterpiece, but it does tell the story of one of america's best pilots. It tells the life of Bob Hoover from his eyes. The stories he tells are almost unbelievable! It was a very entertaining book,  i could hardly put it down, and i would recommend it for anyone who is  interested in aviation, especially those who like to hear great stories of  how aviation has changed over the years+books
Almost turned me off to Heinlein+N+I've been a fan of Heinlein's SF for just about as long as I've been an SF fan at all (somewhere around thirty-five years). But when I read this collection some twenty-odd years ago, it nearly turned me off to the old man altogether.  The fiction is pretty good (although even that isn't Heinlein's best). But to describe the nonfiction accurately, I'd have to use words that Amazon will remove from the review anyway.  For the most part, the pieces collected here represent a side of Heinlein I strongly dislike. Though I respect _Starship Troopers_, it's never going to be my favorite Heinlein novel no matter how many times we quibble over the precise definition of "fascism" -- and I'm not going to have much respect for the nonfiction in this collection.  And mind you, it's not because I disagree with Heinlein's opinions; it's because he gave bad arguments for them and called other people nasty names when they differed. Some of the stuff collected here is tendentious to the point of being propagandistic. (At least in his fiction, he was able to create characters with points of view that differed from his and get into their heads well enough to present them sympathetically -- in short, to grok them. Not here, boy.)  Heinlein (who bought into the Korzybski/General Semantics fad pretty early on) spent a lot of years dismissing philosophers as tailchasers who derive their premises from their conclusions. But his own attempt at philosophy, as represented here in e.g. "The Pragmatics of Patriotism", is very nearly the worst writing on ethical philosophy I've ever seen.  Then, too, people who knew Heinlein report that despite his overall gentlemanly demeanor, he could be pretty churlish toward people who disagreed with him. Well, he's certainly unpleasant here; anybody who doesn't agree with him on the need for massive nuclear buildup is dismissed as a poltroon or a custard-head. Even in the unlikely event that I thought he were _right_, I wouldn't find this a very helpful approach.  Perhaps more surprisingly, his popular writings on _science_ aren't very good. Asimov's reputation as the "great explainer" is in no danger here.  This volume is second only to _Grumbles from the Grave_ in cementing Heinlein's posthumous reputation as a rather mean-spirited fellow whose fictional characters were generally much better company than he was. When I want Heinleinian company, I'll stick to D.B. Davis, Manuel Garcia O'Kelly Davis, and (maybe) Lazarus Long.  And when I want to read some humane nonfiction by an SF master, I'll still turn to Asimov. I credit Heinlein with three magisterial novels, several imperfect-but-great ones, and a good number of brilliant short stories. But the stuff in this book should have stayed in his drawer+books
interesting plot but bad details+N+This book could have been so much better since the plot is really good. The writing here is a knockoff of Michael Crighton and really doesnt juve very well. I found myself skimming the pages after a while. The subject  of a super algorithm to translate code that has been corrupted is a good one and almost deserves to be written over again+books
Lost Credability, QUICKLY!!+N+I admit, I haven't finished this book.  A friend recommended it to me as I have been having problems with insomnia.  I was interested in reading a book about women's health issues and this one sounded intriguing UNTIL she started in with her tarot cards, interest in astrology and angels.  Granted, I am not a firm believer in just "the hard facts" but its really hard to believe anything this woman writes after it is clear that common sense isn't alternative enough for her!+books
I disliked this book so much I returned it!+N+As a lover and avid collector of books, I had high hopes for this book -- at first glance it seemed entrancing, especially the topic.  Unfortunately, once I started reading it more carefully, my spirits sank.  Some of the  pictures are visually interesting, but most are not.  Even more  disappointing, there is not much substantive information either.  If you  like the idea of this book and are looking for a more satisfying read,  check out At Home With Books : How Booklovers Live With and Care for Their  Libraries by Estelle Ellis(Editor), et al.  That book is worth every penny,  and you'll enjoy it+books
SOME THINGS TASTE GOOD BUT BE WARNED!+N+Well I bought this book hoping that I could have more breakfast ideas especially now that my children are going to school full time and I dislike processed cereals. I am a domestic engineer who has studied culinary arts specializing in pasteries. All I have to say is that the recipes that I have tried taste alright but the timing is off. Some pancake recipes call for a little much baking powder that gives the hotcakes a soapy flavour+books
Right?  Right.+P+It's no secret that people who are trying to sell you something will be very careful and sometimes dishonest when it comes to the actual words and phrases they use to describe their product.  In TALKING RIGHT, linguist Geoffrey Nunberg examines the use of language manipulation as it has been used in modern American politics and the effect it has had back on the language itself.  Since the birth of advertising, sellers would spend many hours writing and rewriting slogans, bumper-stickers and sales pitches to make sure that each word had the desired impact on the listener.  But Nunberg's research is more interested not just in how language is utilized by the political salespeople, but how certain words and phrases in the vernacular have ended up being subtly changed by constant repetition and reenforcement from politicians, pundits and spin-meisters.    While the word "liberal" is obviously where the book hangs its hat, other words and phrases have also migrated to take on different meanings and connotations.  For example in a political context, when someone refers to "values", they actually are only discussing a small subset of possible moral issues, regardless of their position on other subjects.  Even a word as old as "Christian" is taking on a more restrictive definition.       TALKING RIGHT is written in an easy-to-read style.  It's breezy and almost conversational without feeling shallow.  I found to it be a little repetitive at times (odd, considering the relatively small word-count), but I forgive it because of all the little facts that I hadn't know.  I had, for example, recently noticed Republicans referring to their opponents as "the Democrat Party".  But I hadn't realized that the deliberate shortening of "Democratic" has been a tactic going back over 70 years.  The book is told mainly from a liberal point of view.  This is because of Nunberg's thesis (and I think that most would agree) that the right-wing has been far more successful at branding words and phrases as belonging to their side of the national discussion.  Nunberg picked up on a lot of things that seemed familiar to me.  Things that I had noticed but hadn't realized that I noticed.  It's a very illuminating book in that way; it crystallizes a lot of things I had only half-realized while listening to left-wing and right-wing talking heads exchanging insults on cable news+books
For shame+N+What is the longevity of John Bradshaw's book, and how does his writing stand up in the perspective of time?  The book was published over ten years ago, and it seems to have dropped through the cracks of the large and populous human growth floorboards, of which it was a part.  The first thing I noticed about Bradshaw's writing is its sheer verbosity.  He writes in a roundabout way, rather than concisely and to the point.  Contrast him, for example, with a writer on Buddhism or Taoism (say, Alan Watts?).    Writing on Buddhism or Taoism may provide authors with a natural impetus to be concise, but the human growth movement is broad and billowy, and concise writing may not be important to the authors.    And Bradshaw seems to drag in every alley cat he ever heard meow in the human growth movement, to help him reflect on what he sees as the underlying principle of it all: Shame.  Bradshaw reports that he is a theologian, but also someone who recovered from alcoholism, and was deeply shamed as a child, which shame he finally learned to deal with and overcome.    There are many fine snippets from his book, which may be of use to folks, but overall, I think most people looking for direction are going to be repelled by his constant conceptualizations.  To paraphrase another well-known quotation, "People cannot live on concepts alone."  If he had given more personal studies or little case histories, it would have been much more helpful.  Instead, he includes page after page of some "guided" meditations or shame inquiries, which were totally useless to me.  If you are looking for guided meditations, this is the place for you.    So, in all, Bradshaw's book does not hold up to scrutiny after time, in my opinion.  It's one of the many from its era and niche that was forgotten and will be unlikely to remembered henceforth.  Anyway, it was a bestseller once, and that's what counts, I guess.  It did have its 15 minutes of fame, and a lot of books never even get that.  Diximus.    +books
Zzzzz+N+Boring and irritating. Not one character is likable, and not one character is 3D+books
I'm really working hard to finish it but its a stuggle!+N+I'm about 1/2 way there and its a struggle to finish - not Cussler's usual - maybe because there is another author and its not his?  Way too many characters - I'm no dummy, but I have to keep referring to the front of the book to remind myself which one of the "cast of characters" he is talking about because he switches every other paragraph to a totally different scene with totally different characters.  The story isn't bad - but beside the confusion of figuring out who he is talking about and where they are, there is so much extra non essential filler in it that it is hard to get involved in it.  I hope it gets better as it goes along, but I doubt it+books
Disapointing+N+This 84 page book is evenly divided between intstructions on how to build a brick oven and recipes for baking in it.  I have not tried the recipes. I made an impulsive purchase of this book because I have been interested in building a brick oven for some time.  I mistakenly thought that I would gain some insights and practical tips that were missing from The Bread Builders by Daniel Wing and Alan Scott.  I did not. There is, in my opinion too little detail in this book to actually construct a quality oven. +books
Practical Advice for High Tech Entrepreneurs+P+This book is an amalgam of the author's experience as a serial high tech entrepreneur and good business common sense.  It provides a compendium of advice that one cannot find in more traditional business books and texts.  It is for those who are thinking about starting a company -- especially, but not necessarily, a high tech company -- and are not certain what to do next or first.  It addresses the "seed stage" of a new venture, primarily before venture capital is raised, when the team is first being assebled and the vision and product are first being formed.  A must read for the first time high tech entrepreneur..+books
Read Other Books First+N+I have recently completed reading BabyWise II. I consider myself a Christian and this book is extremely popular in my church. Throughout the entire book, I had moments of complete confusion and disagreement accompanied by moments of complete agreement and lucidity regarding how to implement these methods. However, by the end, I realized that I should not be confused by or passionately against any section of a book that would truly benefit my child.   While I believe there are some helpful and necessary methods in the book, I had already found much of that advice in other sources. For example, feeding schedules are advocated by many resources, but those other sources are very clear when it comes to making sure babies' basic needs are met before implementing such routines. With my knowledge from other resources, I attempted to read BabyWise with a bit of grace, but at the same time I felt guilt and coercement at many points; for instance, when I realized that my child was having one more meal a day than what is 'recommended' by Mr. Ezzo for a child her age. For the record, my pediatrician generally recommends one more meal than she is receiving for a child her age.   This concern and my confusion on other subjects in the book prompted me to speak to my husband about the book and I asked him to read it. He read only the forward and immediately became suspicious. He asked me if there were any references and I instantly realized there were none. It then became clear that the pediatrician listed as an author indeed had no authorship save the foreword, and that Mr. Ezzo has had no formal education regarding child development. A very quick search on the internet confirmed our deductions, and we found many articles against Mr. Ezzo's methods, including a well documented student's masters thesis. Out of curiosity and still trying to find a way to defend this popular book, I performed internet searches on all of the other resources on child development we own (four books; all of which document research for their claims and advice) and found absolutely no negative press for any.   Based on how unclear I found the teachings in the book and how much bad advice I had to sort out, I strongly urge anybody who reads this book to read other books first. As I said, I don't disagree with all of the methods and advice, but it should be seen as advice from a person who has raised obedient (not a bad thing) children and has no other qualifications beyond that. You could do just as well asking advice from a friend or acquaintence with children who possess qualities you admire. As we all know every child is different and reacts to different discipline methods differently. Please make sure you go to many resources to find the option best suited to your child.   Just an end note: As popular as this book is among my friends, I have not known anybody to follow the BabyWise book beyond feeding schedules and sleeping issues,  and there is a good reason for that: Not all of it is good advice+books
good advice+P+I thought this book had some good points.  ppl should see this book as advice and not follow things so literally.  I noticed many reviews, ppl did not agree with her about breastfeeding.  I notice that she tries not to pressure moms into breastfeeding.  After my baby was born, I felt pressured to breastfeed.+books
The Map that Changed the World+P+If you like to read histories of the great age of scientific discovery, you'll enjoy this story of William Smith and his development of the world's first geology map.  The bonus is the dustcover is actually a copy of his map+books
A Different World+P+It had been way too long since I picked up a Heinlein title: "Stranger in a Strange Land" being the last time I ventured into his densely written world 15 years ago.  The book touts that this is "Science Fiction's most controversial novel"...and I can see that since it was written in 1964.  However, the disturbing elements of slavery, incest, and cannibalism cetainlty transcend time.  As for the storyline, it is inetersting and well put together.  This book seemed to me like two stories in one.  The first half could be entitled "The Survivalist Guide After the Complete Destruction of the World as We Know It" and I shall be certain to take this book with me for reference in the (un)liklihood I ever find myself in a bomb shelter or lost in the woods.    The story finally takes a turn halfway through when we are introduced to the inhabitants of this future Earth.  The "color war" has taken a turn and now dark skinned folk are the masters and the light skinned people are the slaves.  This new world is explained in detail as well as how the caste system works.  Our main characters adapt as best as they can according to their individual personalities.  I do not entirely agree that there is nothing to like about Farnham's clan.  It is a cross section of the kind of personalities that make up the world: leaders, fighters, followers, cowards, dependants, etc.  The strong survive and the weak get sucked into and accept their lot (even learn to like it).    The time travel twist is one of the only features that make this title "sci-fi".  Other than that, it can be looked upon as any other interesting work of fiction.  If you can muddle through the first half of the book, dense with dialogue and technicalities that will make your head spin, you're in for a good read.  This book will make you think and consider how different a world can be if roles were reversed and democracy was no more. +books
Just 1001 Books Some Prof Likes+N+Like so many bad, bad movies, this book is a beautiful production.  It features slick, heavy paper; a million color pictures; attractive, readable typeface; witty contributors.  Its proportions seem just right for its weight.  But unless you just love grazing on hors d'oeuvres (and many do), you're likely to be disappointed by this beautiful but cynical exercise in marketing to the culturally insecure.  As somebody has already noted: No Iliad.  No Odyssey. No Aeschylus. No Euripides. No Boccaccio. No Chaucer. No Dante.  No Machiavelli. No Shakespeare. No Marlowe.   No Old or New Testament. No Q'uran. No Lao-tse, Confucius, Bhagavda-Gita (really short and really good). No Beowulf. No Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.  In fact, only 13 works from before 1700 make the cut - and lest you think fun is the criterion, one of them is John Lyly's Euphues long regarded as one of the most unreadable and, shall we say, "affected" works in English literature. You get John Lyly instead of John Milton.     On the other hand, you do get 69 titles of books that have appeared since 2000.  That's a lot of "classics" in record time.  How did they pick these?  And there's another 700 - out of 1001, if you can dig it, "you must read before you die" written in the 20th Century.  The 19th Century is well represented, I'll grant. Huck Finn is here - but not Twain's more complicated Letters from the Earth, The Mysterious Stranger, A Connecticut Yankee, or Pudd'nhead Wilson.    They also felt it necessary to fill out the list with a few short stories like Lovecraft's "The Mountains of Madness" and Gogol's "The Nose."  Great stories, but two actual books had to go to make room for them.  Books like The Red Badge of Courage, for example.    Or maybe The Red Badge got crowded out by Justine or American Psycho.  This is a book for people who like to read about books in snappy reviews, and look at color pictures of books. You'll find some titles worth pursuing, but you could do better, for starters, just by getting a list of Cliff's Notes titles and going on from there.   You can do that for free+books
outdated and not useful+N+This book was a giant disappointment.  Very outdated - virtually no information on how to do this kind of investing electronically.  A waste of $+books
Too biased+N+It is alright to present an alternative point of view, but it is not right to attack other recovery programs, especially those with a proven track record. I suspect Mr. Trimpey has an axe to grind or is just hostile to the spiritual underpinnings of 12-Step programs.The truth is that one size does not fit all. Some methodswork for some people and other methods work for others. Read this book and try this method. If it does not work try another one. They are all good in their own way. But Mr. Trimpey: If one person, who cannot be helped by your method, ignores other options because of your attack on AA, you should be ashamed of yourself+books
Simply A Must Read!+P+I read this book such a long time ago, and I purchased it for my son to read also.  This book was the one that made me and advid reader and it is so important for every young adult to read it whether African American or other nationality.  It is simply good journalism! You can really feel where the author is trying to go with his dialogue.  It puts peer pressure, city life, drugs, right in the faces of the young adult.  It also helps young adults find a solution to an everyday problem. A great gift for any reader.  This is something to keep in your library for all times+books
Didn't really like it+N+I know that no book can cover every topic, but this book left a lot out. It went into great detail about what I should do if I got some pretty rare diseases, but barely touched on the subject of Morning sickness, which is much more common.  And some of the information was just plain wrong. I trashed the book when it made me freak out in the 20th week because I couldn't feel the baby move. It advised that I should call the doctor. When I did, I found out most women don't feel it move until 21 weeks. Unfortunately I found this out after I had cried my eyes out thinking something was wrong. I would not suggest this book to anyone+books
One of the VERY WORST!+N+This is one of the worst (maybe the worst) books I have ever read. The actual investing technique the author used is explained in less than half a page at the end of the book. The rest of the book is just piles of completely useless and irrelevant stories about the authors travel and adventures that have absolutely nothing to do with his technique or investing. The author and the publisher are insulting the intelligence of readers by publishing such a stupid book.   The technique explained at the end of the book is one of the most basic techniques in Technical Analysis (TA). In the TA terminology, it is called support and resistance levels. If you are interested in this technique, use one of the books on TA. Those books cover it in much more rigor than Darvas' book and they cover a lot more TA techniques that are much more powerful. My favorite book on TA is "How Technical Analysis Works" by Bruce Kamich.    Husam Abu-Haimed, Ph.D.  +books
Shockingly helpful to most patients ...+P+It is truly astonishing how many competent MDs treating acid reflux don't warn their patients of the dietary restrictions facing those who suffer from acid reflex.  This applies not only to family doctors but incredibly ENTs!  As such, patients are strongly advised to "understand their own bodies."  All our bodies are different.  Some patients will have strong negative reactions to chocolate.  Others to orange juice.  Some to red wine.  Some to apple juice.  To fix acid reflux problems - and it is almost always fixable - it is critical to understand what particular foods and beverages are causing it.  This book will help properly identify. +books
Overly simplistic..+N+Barber's analysis ignores important facts in order to prove his thesis about how the primary battle in the world being between the free market and religious fundamentalism. It works, somewhat, but fails to take into account numerous instances where this tension is called into question. Not every zealot in the world is an enemy of technology, as the War in Iraq has shown us.+books
Come back later+N+Even though this is a "popular" version of the theory, with the considerable advantage of being by Einstein himself, it is not so easy as the presentation may imply. Einstein says in his introduction that his reasoning will demand no more than a high-school knowledge. It might be true in his time, but nowadays the book demands a longer study in Physics. I offer myself as an example: I'm a literature student in post-graduation level, and simply couldn't grasp the meaning of many mathematical demonstrations he uses to make his points. His reasoning is also obscure in many passages (what are really those 'galilean coordinates'?). Perhaps these details seem self-evident for professional readers, but they are not for the general public (the implied target of the book). In brief, Einstein didn't succeed completely in his attempt at popularization. +books
Hated It+N+I love the Scarpetta books, but I had to force myself to finish this one.  The plot was disjointed, and the use of the English language was atrocious.  I can't believe she published this.  It is absolutely not up to par.  If you're going to waste your time on this book, get it from a library so you don't waste your money as well+books
Very light book... don't recommend it+N+This book has nothing to offer, except for those of you who now nothing about Orisha Tradition, and are curious. Otherwise don't waste your time and money..+books
Great Book+P+Second time I've bought this book because it's so helpful.  A must for  sales, or any interpersonal dynamics - family, etc.  Very well written, concise, easy to understand and put theory into practice.  Read it and then get others to, so you can discuss and appreciate the theory and use it to make daily communication so much easier+books
Very Disappointed+N+What a waste. The book is very general in nature. No concrete information on the business itself. The book is not properly bound as it is completely falling apart. Save your money and invest it elsewhere+books
What a Disappointment+N+Blum's biography of Harlow does an excellent job of examining the man and the scientist, "warts and all." Yes, it's unflinching in its descriptions of the experiments performed on macaques showing the effects of maternal deprivation; yes, it's unflinching on showing the psychology of the man who performed these experiments and the sad effects his psychological predispositions had on his personal life. Poor monkeys! Poor Harlow! But never fear; Blum is here to provide us with reassurance: it all had to be that way - really, it did. True, the experiments sound really nasty; but hey, that's just how things were done in those days. Really, it's all okay, in the long run, because now, even though we still musn't question the basic scientific premises regarding the necessity of animal research, at least we don't have to perform those particular nasty experiments anymore; and really - really - Harlow was, in his own perverted way, something of a hero. Even animal rights activists have cause to be thankful to him: because of him, we now have a convenient enemy to vilify, not to mention that desperately needed scientific proof positive that monkeys are more complex than we once believed, and hence deserve a little extra consideration. Thank you, Harry Harlow. Thank you, Deborah Blum, for puffing him back up again after the deflated view you left us with in The Monkey Wars. See people? He really wasn't such a bad guy after all.  All you have to do is look at him in just the right way. . . .   +books
Best darn Latin dictionary on the market+P+I just wanted to add another vote of confidence for this marvelous dictionary.  I got through 4 years of college Latin with it, and almost never failed to find the word I was looking for.  I particularly appreciate the idiomatic expressions highlighted in bold typeface, to make it easy to skim down the definition to find the one you're looking for.  Its only downfall is that, as a paperback, it begins to get a bit well-thumbed, leading the serious Latinist to think, a little wistfully, that it would be nice if it came in a hardbound edition.  But for a mere six bucks, you can easily afford to buy a replacement.  Personally, I own two+books
The Tears of my Father and Mother+P+A superb literary work ! When I read Carlos's writings, it brought tears to my eyes. He was writing about my father and mother's hardships and triumps in the 1950's Livermore and Pleasanton area of California. We were  one of the first Filipino families of that area and my parents worked hard  through all the hardships to graduate five children from major California  universities. As Filipino Americans we owe much to the Manong generation.  Many of the Manong generation are buried with full military honors. Many  have fought and died alongside their brothers from the midwest, the south  and all over America.It's a tribute to a proud segment of the Greatest  Generation of America , the WWII generation+books
Weak women -- an Anne Tyler speciality+N+This is only the second Anne Tyler book I've read and I'm not impressed. The book was depressing. I had hope as the book progressed that the main character would &quot;triumph&quot; over her circumstances but instead she subsumed her own dreams for her husband's wants and needs. Anne Tyler implies that this is a noble sacrifice but I thought it was weak. She should have left her loser husband+books
Could win any poor writing award+N+The work of a 12 year-old without talent. Phrases are tediously cobbled with clumsy, inappropriate similies. Story line is absurd. If this were Koontz's first novel, no publisher would touch it+books
"WOW"? I think not+N+I read the reviews here before purchasing this book and was encouraged by some of them. In addition to this book, I purchased Illustrator CS Killer Tips and Adobe Illustrator CS Idea Kit. Now, not to the insult the author, but this book was horrifying. I felt like I was reading a boring, difficult college textbook! I'm not new to Adobe or the interface, and I self-taught myself Elements and Photoshop. I must say that I was severely dissapointed by the lack of visual aid, visual detail, and failure to get me intrigued - how could I be with pages and pages of text to read with one or two pictures of angles or crappy artwork? I have to find another Illustrator book so I actually learn something...what a dissapointment! The CD was also relatively dissapointing - nothing was interactive and was not at all well-explained in the book or the content on CD. Plus, some of the lessons were advertisements for Steuer's online classes. Ha! The only good thing was the art that it did have was in color, and color is good - which is why I gave it one more star than I would've. If you buy it, don't open the CD so you have the option of returning it+books
One D Thing After Another+N+Line by line the writing is superb. Ford has an eye for making insignificant detail seem important. But here may be the problem with ID. The constant shift to describing everything in the narrator's line of vision confuses my sense of what's relevant.

I'm done with Baldacci+N+Since the reviews printed on the inside cover of the book all are blurbs, here are my blurbs:  "Really hard to get into ... tough to follow who's who ..."

disappointed+N+Lewis' qualifications as mid-east scholar sound impressive but I was disappointed by this book.  Although interesting, some of the essays are indicative of senility.

a long book that seems to get longer as you read it+N+The relationships between the various characters weren't convincing and I failed to connect to the main character, Lottie, at all.  The book seemed to ramble on, and didn't catch my interest.  There were a few parts where the action picks up, but they were like tiny islands surrounded by a vast ocean of blandness+books
NOT what the doctor ordered!+N+Liza Picard's book on mid-eighteenth century London is essentially for those who like to dip into a topic and have a short attention span. Though long, there is less to it than first meets the eye.  This is history-lite and as such would probably have found limited favour with Dr Johnson himself. Ms Picard has used some interesting material from medical sources of the day but her reliance on The Gentleman's Magazine as a source shows in the notes at the end of the book. There is little attempt to relate all this detail to the actual events of the times, so the reader is left with a far from balanced picture of what mid-eighteenth century London was really like+books
Teachers United+P+As a high school teacher I was surprised and pleasantly amused to hear that Jon Stewart had decided to make a Teacher's Edition of anything.  When I found out that a colleague of mine had decided to buy the book and reference it in a History class I thought that I should look it over and see if it was worth its weight in satire.  It is definitely worth its weight in something.  I find that The Daily Show's viewpoint is refreshing and that Jon Stewart's attempts at unraveling the political veil is essential to what we consider Democracy.  The Citizen's Guide to Democracy Inaction is a good reference and cocktail party conversation starter.  I think that most of the book is interesting but I wouldn't want my child to come home and quote verbatim some of the blather that is inside.  As a book for the masses sure.  As a book intended for teachers no.  I suppose that is the joke of it all.  No teacher should use this text as a real reference or they would probably end up on 60 Minutes or The Daily Show explaining why their students were arrested for harrassing Supreme Court justices with naked pictures+books
A Mile Wide And An Inch Thin+N+For an experienced financial professional, this text does not add much value.  The book touches upon a great many subjects, but does not appear to cover any one in any depth.  The book may be most appropriate as an introductory text on the subject on the undergraduate level but not as a practioner's desk reference.  As a professional with significant experience in investment banking with a CPA and MBA, I was looking for in-depth guide to the specific mechnanics of the contoller's function+books

What is positive?  innacurate arguments+N+What exactly is positive about the Koran and its view of women?  Every single assertion of this polemic is either a complete fabrication or wrong.  The Hadiths and Sunna are not the chauvinistic part 'corrupting' the Koran, if anything the opposite is true.  In Surah 4:34 the Koran orders the Husband to beat his wife.  In numerous Suras the husband is ordered to pay the equivalent of a dowry to his wife, not her family however.  The entire Koranic book of 'women' is simply one law after another about 'them' which is to say the women.  The reason it is talking about 'them' when referring to women and 'us' when speaking about men is because the Koran is meant for men.  There is not one equality in the entire Koran dealing with women and men.  Men may take four wives women, women presumably one husband.  Men may have slaves and men may marry and do as they please sexually with the slaves.  No similar injunction applies for women.  Men receive virgins and wine and service in heaven...the situation of women in heaven is left to the imagination, although presumably they make up the virgins.    The Koran details a world of only men where women are not only chattel but are the sexual objects of the society, sold as slaves and used and then divorced at the mans pleasure.  There is not one equality.  Scholars have argued that Koran reformed women's rights and elevated their status because in pre-Islamic Arabia women had NO rights and under Koran they are entitled to at least a dowry and a man may not take endless numbers of wives.  This doesn't translate as equality, it translates as a male centered world, where men are masters and women are virtually property.   The fact that god in Koran is not referred to as 'father' does not indicate a feminist view of god but merely reflects the very monotheistic nature of Islam, certainly a valid fact that differentiates it from Christianity.  However once again this is not evidence of women's rights, because the non-gender view of god doesn't change the very negative view of women's role on earth given in the Koran.  If someone is going to read this they should certainly have handy an unbiased translation of the Koran so they can reflect on all the laws regarding women and why those same laws do not apply equally to men, for instance one  might wonder why a wife may not beat her disobeying husband? Or why the husband is not commanded to be modest?    Seth J. Frantzman   +books
The Seminal Defence of Globalisation+P+Martin Wolf, noted Financial Times columnist and professional economist, has written the most readable, empassioned and convincing defence of the new global economic order to date.  Wolf's approach assumes little knowledge on the part of the reader, while at the same time demanding a keen intellect to follow all of his arguments through to their conclusions.  Most effective are his relentlessly convincing counters to virtually all of the objections raised by the rag-tag "anti-globalisation" crowd, as Wolf clearly demonstrates that globalisation increases economic output and wealth everywhere and for everyone, and that without globalisation, poor countries are destined to remain poor.  Wolf's main thrust is that the world needs more globalisation, not less, and he remains critical of Western countries who themselves contribute to "limited" globalisation by continuing protectionist agricultural tariffs and retaliatory tariff and dumping practices.  In all, a complete tour-de-force, and utterly convincing that the path we are on as a world is the right one, and that the arguments of the critics are more sentimental than real+books

You really need to purchase this one!+P+I could not put this one down.  The Autism Spectrum is so diverse and difficult to understand.  This book allows one to get into the mind of a child with Autism and get a grasp on how he/she perceives the world around them.  Things we say and do on a regular basis, are perceived very differently to someone with Autism for a variety of reasons which this book covers.  Activities that we may enjoy, sometimes, are simply too much, even nausiating at times for someone with Autism.  These "Ten Things" that the book mentions, really opens ones eyes to a whole different way of understanding and interacting with an individual with Autism. It really showed me better ways to  communicate with them. For anyone at all that has or is working with someone on the spectrum, you need to read this book.  It will help you to be more sensitive and them better.  Thank you for this book+books
Elementary school returns+N+I bought this book because it was required (a textbook for a class I was taking).  Because it was a college-level class, I was expecting a college-level textbook.  That's not what it is at all.  The book is filled with color illustrations that aren't even very helpful.  I was hoping for more reading and explanation of terms.  Illustrations are great if they are used right -- to compliment the text instead of replace it.  I wouldn't recommend this book for someone who is serious about learning the ins and outs of networking+books
Tech Marketing Insight+P+Ever wonder why so many innovative products never have the commercial success that the innovation deserves? &quot;Inside the Tornado&quot; is an invaluable resource for high tech marketing.

A great read for marketers and techies interested in marketing their own innovations+books
A Letter To Sean Hannity...+N+Dear Sean,  Thanks for sending me your book "Deliver Us from Evil : Defeating Terrorism, Despotism, and Liberalism." Before I put the book down and turn off my light and go to sleep I just wanted to dash off a quick letter to you so you could clarify a thing or two for me. Let me get this straight. You'd like to see all Liberals vanish from the face of the American political system and have only Conservative Republicans running the show...is that right? Hmm...Let me see, if my memory serves me right there were some political states or nations that did function for a while under a one party system. There was the Soviet Union 1917-1991, Fascist Italy 1923-1945, Nazi Germany 1933-1945. Those are three just off the top of my head. They didn't like Liberalism either. Well, Sean I got to get going. I'm sure I'll write again soon.  All my best,  Bill  PS. Remember, fanaticism is far from being fair and balanced+books

Disappointing+N+While this book makes some interesting points it comes across more as an anti-tradition propaganda piece than a useful treatise on martial arts.  While the author is an experienced, highly knowledgeable practitioner, his understanding of the traditional martial arts that he rails against is incomplete and oftentimes inaccurate. Don't get me wrong; I certainly do not believe that the author is an idiot.  I believe that he is the victim of bad teaching, an all too common occurrence in martial arts.  For example, he states that, "today's full-contact fighters throw devastating, lightning fast punches from a distance of less than two feet.  Against this kind of speed, classical blocks and punches simply do not stand a chance.  What amazes me is how a flaw of this magnitude - and one that is taught to thousands of unknowing students every day - still exists in what are, otherwise, extremely potent arts..." This is just flat wrong.  Contrary to Mr. Orlando's understanding, in classical blocks the hand that is out (e.g. just punched or blocked) performs the actual block, check, or deflection, while the hand that is in chamber executes a technique designed to control the opponent's limb.  Even though it is often hidden, almost all blocks in traditional karate styles utilize this check/control methodology.  In all cases, there is never ever any "wind-up" preceding anything.  In most traditional schools all but the most junior students understand that simple fact.  To delve deeper, the word "uke" translates more accurately to "receive" than it does to "block."  When viewed in this context, it may be easier to understand that practitioners typically check, deflect, or control an attack rather than meeting it force-on-force.  Using the traditional check/control methodology, a practitioner's outstretched hand need only deflect an attack by a few inches to spoil its effect when contact is made close to an opponent's body.  In this fashion karateka can easily avoid being hit by even the most "devastating" of punches no matter how fast, or how powerfully, or even how unexpectedly they are thrown.  Common misconceptions such as this one are the reason that I believe it is imperative to supplement the traditional modeling approach to instruction with interactive discussions and other teaching styles.  Regardless, I hate to see this sort of stuff perpetuated...  Now that I've ripped him down, I will point out that there are some redeeming concepts in this book.  For example, the author also promotes practicing martial arts in the same sort of attire one might be wearing in real life.  If you have spent your whole life barefoot in a dojo, training with loose fitting clothes, you may well be in for a shock the first time you have to fight in tight-fitting jeans wearing boots.  This is a very valid point.  I wholeheartedly agree that practitioners should devote some of their training to more realistic conditions though that often must occur at their home rather than in a tradition karate school.  All in all, however, there is not enough meat in this book for me to feel like I got my money's worth from purchasing it.  It was disappointing. Get Sifu Orlando's book "Indonesian Fighting Fundamentals: The Brutal Arts Of The Archipelago" instead. It's a great read and well worth buying.

not bad,but neither good+N+it is pretty general,there is no such thing as advice or anything the like about practices.he insists in almost every chapter that the mission is the most important thing.the only intersting ideas in his book are some about leadership, but i felt very much that i already knew them,he only confirmed them.this is not to say i am a genius.i am 18, so i guess if you are involved in running a nonprofit for more than one year, you would be able to write a better book.  for a beginner it might be intersting to get it from the library, and read it in a train or so.  not bad, but getting a book on leadership,and other one  on marketing is a much better idea+books
IT WORKS....Plain and simple.+P+I had heard about the South Beach Diet 2 years ago through my Mom and Dad and sister.  They all follow it and I thought I couldn't do it because I was nursing my baby.  I wish I had tried it sooner!!!  You can do this diet while pregnant/nursing and no matter what your health situation is!  My physician said it is the ONLY diet he will encourage people to follow.  It will work, it just takes a little discipline in the beginning (Phase 1).  You get through that and it's easy street.  I started the diet On March 1st, 2006 weighing 170 lbs. and a size 16.  I weighed myself this morning and am down to 145 and a junior size 11.  I am 5' 7" so I am technically well within my ideal weight range, but I am shooting for 140lbs.  I KNOW it will happen any day now.  I am in Phase 3 and I eat dessert (in moderation), bread (whole grain) and LOTS of yummy dishes!!!  I've even got my kids cooking in the kitchen with me and they eat foods you'd never believe a little kid would eat.  It's a family plan and a way of life.  I've got so much more energy that I WANT to exercise any chance I get now!  My whole family is healthier and happier for it.  I do recommend reading both books--read them over and over...I've read the South Beach Diet 4 or 5 times.  When you feel a little down or like you're falling off the wagon, read it.  It will reaffirm what you're doing and why you're doing it.  TRY IT, YOU'LL LIKE IT!  Good luck~~Juli+books

A Touching Life+P+I live in Thailand and have traveled to Burma (sometimes called &quot;Myanmar&quot;).  I was prepared to like this book and I was expecting the heroic life story that I got.  I was not, however, prepared for the beauty of the writing and the depth of the tragedy so simply, but touchingly, told.  It is simply amazing to me that anyone can write so beautifully in a second language; Thwe is very talented.  I hope that he keeps writing.  I also hope that in his next book, he drops some of the reserve that characterizes his cultural upbringing and lets us into his inner life a little more+books
Great Go-To Book+P+I originally got this book when I first moved out on my own. I had some cooking experience which I gleaned from my mother, but with a limited spread of recipes and without much on-my-own experience.  This book helped me a great deal as a beginner cook, and taught me most of the basics. Years later, I'm a much better cook, and though I rarely use this book's recipes at face value, I often reference it for a guideline to dishes that I enjoy, while adding my own touches. Also, when I'm preparing to try something new, this is generally the first book I go to, even after all this time.  Other cook books have come and gone, but this one has staying power for me, earning it its five stars. A great purchase for a young adult, or even an every-day cook who just isn't very good, or who has a limited array of recipes. It is also a great reference for anyone who just wants a base to branch out from+books
Crossword Puzzling for Fun and Profit+P+Matt Gaffney is one of only a dozen or so people in the U.S. who makes a living as a freelance crossword puzzle constructor. It's not easy and there's a lot of competition. The pay per puzzle is low and it takes hours to construct a quality puzzle. How does he do it? The same way any freelancer does it. He works his butt off. After creating some of the best puzzles around, he finds new markets, cultivates old markets, networks, looks for new angles, and acts as his own bill collector. His latest angle is Gridlock, an entertaining book about the crossword puzzle business and the  eccentric people who populate it.  Gridlock is a somewhat unstructured, but fun look at the crossword world from the viewpoint of a constructor. Previous crossword books have profiled constructors (The Crossword Obsession), told how to construct crosswords (The Puzzlemaker's Handbook), or told of life as a crossword solver (Crossworld). As far as I know, this is the first look from the constructor's point of view.   Gaffney takes us behind the scenes at the Annual Crossword Puzzle Tournament. He tells us how he came to be a crossword constructor, how he nearly had to give up freelancing and get a real job, and what saved him from that awful fate. He describes what goes into the construction of a puzzle (it's more interesting than you might imagine), and tackles the computer vs. human constructor debate. He finishes up with a profile of puzzlemaker and noted recluse Henry Hook. With that final chapter, it's apparent that if Gaffney ever runs out of work as a crossword constructor (is sudoku a passing fad or something more sinister?), he'll be able to make a career as a more traditional freelance writer+books
Damage Control for the current President+N+I found this book to be based on a kernel of truth wrapped in innumerable layers of unconfirmable speculation (how many people really have access to intelligence agency archives?) and one-sided 'analysis'.  It is clear the Bin Ladin was 'lost' at Tora Bora when our troops were called back to garrison, allowing him to escape.  This goes even farther to the right than Micheal Moore goes to the left.  If you want a look at the subject from someone who was involved through several Administrations, read "Against All Enemies: Inside America's War on Terror" by Richard Clarke.  If you buy this book, you are paying for propaganda+books
Nothing New+N+Delightfully short in length, "The Good Body" takes a mere hour to peruse and completely read...which is a blessing.  The repetitious cliches used to re-assure women that whatever the body form or shape, the body is good.  There is nothing new to enlighten or educate the reader, and nothing one hasn't read or heard beforehand.  Regardless of how compelling an argument in favor of an unaltered natural appearance the author puts forth, the bottom line is that in our global community looks and body shape DO still make a difference in a woman's life choices and success.  This feminist rhetoric is no different than that which has been preached since the onslaught of "Feel good about yourself" books in the 1960's, 70's and 80's.  +books
Boycott Robert G. Allen!!!+N+Robert G. Allen is a notorious and relentless internet spammer.  If you should happen to somehow end up on one of his email lists like I did, he will send you several junk emails a day.  Unsubscribing doesn't work, and trying to block the sender's domain is useless because the emails are sent from a different domain every time.  The funny part is that the emails aren't even coded properly.  They always show up as just a bunch of html code.  Would you really take internet money-making advice from a guy who can't even code html properly?  Anyway, his spamming practices are completely illegal and it's only a matter of time before the law catches up with him.  But that shouldn't come as any surprise considering that mister Allen has been in trouble with the law before.  He's had several run-ins with the IRS, lawsuits against him, and a chapter 7 bankruptcy.  I would also stay away from his Nothing Down real estate methods.  Many of those practices are illegal, and the president of the Nothing Down club in Atlanta wound up in federal prison because of it.  For more info on Allen, visit johntreed dottcomm, click on Real Estate Investing, then click Real Estate Guru Ratings.  Bottom line, don't trust this guy and don't buy his books. And if you're reading this Mr. Allen, take me off your @%#&*$ mailing list!!+books
This book rocks+P+The best out there. cant live without this awesome boo+books
Misleading+N+This is a very misleading book. There were many points that I would criticize, but it would take an entire book to do that. So I'll pick out three important issues and focus on those.  Issue One: Welfare and Out of Wedlock Childbirths  One example is the effect of welfare on out of wedlock childbirths. On page 59 Iceland criticizes the theory that welfare payments are responsible for increased rates of out of wedlock childbirths. Iceland points to the fact that inflation-adjusted welfare payments have declined, whereas out of wedlock childbirths have increased. But single mothers are available for other assistance programs such as food stamps, public housing, and Medicaid. When the full package of benefits is included, the total aid available to single mothers has kept up with inflation.   On page 136 Iceland cites Robert Moffit's 1992 research showing that welfare has only caused a slight increase in out of wedlock childbirths. But after other researchers such as Mark Rosenzweig and the economists Jeff Grogger and Stephen Bronars found a large connection, Moffit reexamined the issue. His more thorough methodology and found that welfare did cause a significant increase in out of wedlock childbirths. Moffit reported this in 1998. Why did Iceland mention his 1992 research but not his 1998 research?  Issue Two: The Color of Poverty  One problem is that Iceland documents the fact that poverty statistics show that most of the poor are white. On page 38 he criticizes the fact that most media reports tend to show pictures of blacks when discussing poverty, thus creating a false perception. But as Iceland discusses, most poverty is short term, usually from a divorce, a death, or a lost job. On page 49 he mentions that black children make up a majority of the long term poor.  I would submit that when people think about poverty they think about long term poverty, not brief poverty spells. Like it or not, Americans have to grapple with the fact that entrenched, generational poverty is disproportionately black.  Issue Three: Cause of Poverty  The biggest problem with the book is its analysis of the cause of poverty. It concludes that out of wedlock childbirths are a minor cause relative to the inequality embedded in a free market, capitalist society. But the way it reaches that conclusion is through a statistical analysis in which possible causes are each treated as independent variables to see which explains the greatest amount of poverty.   But supporters of the theory that poverty is caused by out of wedlock childbirths do not blame the out of wedlock birth in itself. After all, college educated single mothers show that an out of wedlock childbirth is not necessarily a ticket to poverty. The problem is the lost opportunity in terms of the chance of graduating high school and college. Page 422 of the bipartisan policy book 'The New World of Welfare' documents the fact that while most out of wedlock childbirths happen to women in their 20's, half of all *first* out of wedlock childbirths happen to women in their teens (fortunately this is on the decline). This is early enough to interfere with the mother's education, and makes it much more likely that she will drop out, or not go to college. The lesson is that the other factors that cause poverty, such as education, are dependent upon family breakdown. They are not independent variables, and any statistical analysis that treats them as though they were independent will come up with flawed results.  There is another problem. Even if Iceland is correct that out of wedlock childbirths do not cause poverty, the research of Sara McLanahan and Gary Sandefur in their landmark book 'Growing Up With a Single Parent' documents the fact that children of single mothers are more likely to drop out of school, abuse drugs, suffer from depression or low self-esteem, have lower lifetime earnings, and are more likely to have out of wedlock children themselves. Furthermore, only about half of this gap can be attributed to poverty itself. Fatherlessness is an independent contributing factor.  I would instead recommend that interested readers check out 'The New World of Welfare' edited by Rebecca Blanks and Ron Haskins. It is a bipartisan collection of essays on welfare and poverty representing the left and right. It is interesting that none of the "liberal" contributors disagreed with the "conservative" claim that family breakdown is an important cause of poverty. And on the other side, none of the "conservatives" disagreed with the liberal claim that although welfare reform has been successful, there have been some women who are worse off. The liberal theory could be put this way: "family breakdown is an important cause of poverty, but we need to find a way to both provide aid *and* fix the family." The only differences are on policy prescriptions, not analysis. It is a refreshing bit of consensus in an otherwise acrimonious debate. I would also recommend 'Civil Rights' by Thomas Sowell and 'The Marriage Problem' by James Wilson+books
The Princess Bride+P+The Princess Bride is one of my all-time favorites. It's incredibly funny and entertaining.  My main reason to write a review is to inform the general public that S. Morgenstern is a narrating device used by William Goldman: this is not an "abridged" book, every word was written by Goldman. All hail Goldman. So don't spend the rest of your life searching for the "original"---this is it+books
Well done and thorough+P+As someone new to martial arts but not to stretching, this book is a great resource. Years of dance training taught me the importance of stretching but there was a lot I'd forgotten and some I'd never learned in the first place. It's so helpful to have the author explain, in plain english, how stretching works and why some exercises are successful while others are a waste of time. I also found the harder and easier variations for each exercise a big help in modifying some of the exercises to suit what I need as I work on my flexibility at home between classes. Highly recommended for anyone looking to become more flexible or just stay in shape.+books
Too artsy for its own good+N+I thought I was going to get a thriller when I first heard of this.  Instead I got a pseudo-sequel to COLD MOUNTAIN set in 1980 Texas, and I have rather low opinions of COLD MOUNTAIN.  It was difficult to follow the story due to McCarthy's decision to not only avoid using quotation marks to identify dialogue (a move I've always considered to be a pretentious affectation), but also commas, apostrophes, and proper spelling, such as not capitalizing "English" or using "livingroom" instead of "living room" and "mam" instead of "ma'am."  I don't know if this is something McCarthy does in all his books or this was a one-time deal, but it was a major turnoff and made the experience grueling rather than enjoyable.  I also didn't see the relevance of the italicized monologues of Sheriff Bell at the beginning of each chapter/section, as he tended to ramble on about life after  World War Two and how it wasn't uncommon to see 22-year-olds as ordained ministers or 25-year-olds as sheriffs of counties the size of Delaware.  Hopefully its movie adaptation (which I legitimately pity the Coen Brothers for having to wade through) is more accessible+books
Known as America's Poet, Whitman is not poetic+N+Walt Whitman's life's work is his "Leaves of Grass", enlarged over the years with additional poems.  Regarded as America's poet, Whitman wrote in the 1840s through the 1880s, encompassing both the "Manifest Destiny" ideology of the pre-war, through the Reconstruction period of US History.    The poems are diverse and upbeat.  The language, for the most part, is clear and easy.  Nevertheless, like most poetry today, the poems are so little different from prose, except in the presentation into lines.  Very few poetic devises are used.  One may correctly criticize my critique as one who does not appreciate contemporary poetry.  But, in comparison to rhyhming verse by Longfellow, Frost, Byron, Browning, or Shakespeare, current poetry appears meaningless.    Although a classic, "Leaves of Grass" offers only one or two poems that qualify for a standard anthology.  None of his poems are memorable.  Not a single line is considered worthy of citing anywhere in literature.  I give two stars to the work, simply because I must admit my own incompetence in modern poetry appreciation.  Whitman is considered important enough to be the major poet in the movie, "Dead Poet's Society"; so, the reputation of the work must be quite impressive, though it beats me how that is+books
Long Boring Read+N+Lots of data, but the story to tell seems to have never been found.  The findings are really not that interesting+books
Great Resource For the Classroom....+P+The Giant Jam Sandwich is written by the same author as Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs. The pictures are cute and engaging. This story is easy to follow and readily lends itself to be used as a "think-a-loud". What a great catalyst for simple writing activities for the K - 2 classroom. I am very pleased with my purchase+books
One sorry excuse for a book+N+This was assigned for summer reading in freshman yr at my college. I can't believe gibberish stuff like this gets published. Kingston's past accounts were boring to read about, at times confusing with all the muti-named relatives. The events were and pointless and just blah. I tried to make it to the end of the book, but sadly I didn't. It was just too boring! I would give this less than one star if I could. Do yourself a favor and avoid this like the plague.+books
Great book+P+Really nice book for night and low light photografy. Step by strep approach, great examples, really wonderfull photos. I think that it will make me a better photographer. The only thing is missing is one chapter for digital photography (to be honest i am a amateur photographer that i have shot only with sony cybershot f-717 and lately with nikon D70) but i give 5 stars because all the technics the author gives (apart from the ones related to film section) are applicable in the digital world as well+books
Biased+N+I checked out this book from the library for a history project, but I found the information and analysis in this book too biased for use on a research paper. This book is an attack on the Clinton administration and communism, not a history book. The book fails to incorporate the current domestic and global conditions in China, and rely too heavily on common beliefs of the "evils" of the communist theory. Of course, history has proven that communism is bad, but he fails to understand, there is a reason why the government in China is still in place today. The author fails to understand the thinking, history, and cultures of the Chinese. In his suggestions of how the United States should act against China, the author makes a clear statement that the ends justify the means, and indirectly states that it's okay for the United States to be immoral to eliminate any competition. In a world where people constantly criticizes our arrogance and ignorance, his suggestions confirms the criticisms about how we believe we are the best, and everyone should follow our example without a true understanding of the situation.  Ironically, we are the country that emphasizes diversity, but we are also the country who forces others to be just like us even though our model might not fit for their country+books
Not that great+N+I was surprised when I took this class that I did not like this book.  All of my epid profs highly recommended this text.  You have to flip back and forth when you are doing the problems because they list the SAS output that you need once in one chapter.  I know it saves space, but this can get maddening.  I did not find the examples clearly written at all-the lack of fit test, and some of the stuff about partial F tests could have used a few more sentences.    No, I cannot write a glowing review of the text, but the only reason for the second star is because I also had a terrible instructor for this course.  Perhaps if Dr. Kleinbaum had taught this to me, I would have a different perspective of this book.  However, I was pretty much teaching myself this material, and this book is not designed for that.+books
Personally appealing, largely impractical+P+In The Reinvention of Work, Matthew Fox brings together the work of Eastern and Western mystics, ancient, medieval, and modern, to propose a new paradigm for how we work and what we do. Citing Meister Eckhart, Thomas Aquinas, Hildegard von Bingen, the Bhagavad Gita, Tao Te Ching, Studs Terkel, Patch Adams, and progressive economists, Fox explores the concept of work and how it can be healthier physically, emotionally, and intellectually, but primarily socially, environmentally, and spiritually.  Fox believes that the Enlightenment and the industrial age have left us with a machine-centered, anthropocentric world that focuses on outer work and rewards at the cost of inner work and spirituality, and destroys rather than creates. Real wealth results from preserving the health of the planet, not in the artificiality of money or possessions. The result has been a world often at war, where the gaps between affluent and poor continue to spread, where the environmental health of non-industrialised nations is sacrificed for the comforts of the industrialised, and where the work that is available and that most people have serves machines and leaves the worker stressed, addicted to work, ill, angry and even violent, and unfulfilled intellectually, emotionally, and spiritually.  Fox cites mystics like Eckhart and Aquinas to show that they understood what is important and that they prophetically understood the traps that man is prone to fall into. He also recounts the stories of people who reinvent themselves through work, who are willing to sacrifice position and possessions to find an avocation that matters, like the man who gives up a high-paying position to become a fireman and who is ecstatic about the meaning it brings to his life.  Fox carefully sets up all that is wrong with our modern concept of work and, indeed, life, since so much of who we are, how we feel, and how we live is tied up in what we do for a living, or what we mistakenly call "work." His proposed solutions are centered around creation spirituality, which is a "creation-centered mysticism that is also prophetic and socially transformative." While creation spirituality is not very clearly defined here-Fox has written several other books about it and refers to them-it appear to center around the idea that creation comes from within and that we create our world, which is part of a greater, interdependent cosmos that continues to undergo creation. For Fox, "enlightenment" might mean recognising and embracing creation spirituality and our responsibility and role in the ongoing creation of the cosmos-a recognition that begins with inner work and extends outer work, and that redefines wealth and poverty. Fox is quick to point out that this is neither communism nor socialism, both of which suffer from the same destructive values as capitalism.  There are many elements involved in creation spirituality, which embraces many aspects of life that have been neglected, distorted, or abused, from education, health care, art, psychology, and sexuality to something he believes is critical yet missing or misused-ritual. In creation spirituality and the reinvention of work, properly conceived and performed ritual is meaningful, bringing people together, bringing out emotions, and acknowledging what has been done in the name of war, destruction, and hate. Ritual can also be playful and energising, for example, circle dances. Whatever the focus, ritual brings us together to share our common joys and sorrows. Ritual heals.  Mysticism appeals to me, and Fox's assessments of what's wrong and what could be done to change our course make sense and are supported by the quotes he provides from a  broad array of sources, including psychologists, economists, writers, and artists. The consequences of not changing are clear, but it is equally clear that those consequences have not penetrated to either the masses or their leaders. (Even the rising price of gasoline in 2005 has not inspired any more than cautious apprehension.) We are like smokers who are able to quit our habit only when terminal lung cancer has been diagnosed.  To get billions of conditioned consumers (and their consumers-in-training children) to give up their increasingly complex lifestyles, comforts, and amusements in the interest of a healthier, more just world for all and for better personal mental and physical health requires a utopian change that most people will not embrace. As with the Woolgers in their book, The Goddess Within, Fox tries to find a movement in the mid-1990s that has not materialised yet. Generally, people do not choose to change; they are forced to. Perhaps someday, when the gaps have widened too far, and society and our home can no longer support our appetites (and the corresponding waste), we may be ready to listen to Fox and his adherents, at which point they will need to provide practical answers. Who will "make ritual"? Who will produce the necessities and how? Who will distribute them? How will they be paid, or what will replace a monetary/barter economy? What if there is imbalance between what people want to do and what needs to be done? In practical, everyday terms, what does the reinvention of work look like? And do I want to live long enough to experience the disasters that are likely to be required to bring it about?  Eckhart, Aquinas, von Bingen, the Bhagavad Gita, Tao Te Ching-all wise beyond their times. And beyond ours as well.  Diane L. Schirf, 21 August 2005+books
Barry outdoes his previous form+P+Dave Barry writes as though he were Elmore Leonard on speed.  It is hard to say exactly where the plot loses and contact with reality and possibility, but at the end you have to sit back and laugh and blow a sigh of satisfaction and relief that such things cannot happen, such people cannot actually exist.  Quite.  Like Leonard, Barry's characters get their motivations, a lot of them, from the draw of the illegal, the desire to make big quickly.  They are such strange people, each one perhaps, just, possible, and yet thrown together they interact in ways that could never be real.  And Barry keeps the entire thing just teetering on the edge between hysteria and tragedy, leaving his readers poised to fall either way, and laughing the entire time, both from the absurd humour and from relief.  I don't know how many other books Barry has since written, novels, i mean, not his humour columns (this was his debut fiction), but i shall have to read them and leave his newspaper offerings alone.  They, the columns, aren't even in the same realm, let alone league+books
Sinks like a stone, stinks like a monkey+N+This is the first book by Deaver that I have read.  Apparently there are a couple of prequels to this novel involving the same main characters -- I will never read them.  Deaver has adequate style and a talent for pacing a mystery thriller.  He also has some skill in character development; however, he only applies this skill to the secondary characters in this story.  Perhaps the main characters in this story appeared so flat to me because I have not read the other novels in this series, but judging by their inconsistent behavior, bizarre motivations, and the melodramatic dialogue in this novel I doubt the other books could be much better.  Worse than Deaver's hackneyed mystery cut-out-characters is his insistence that the reader be willing to accept the most unbelievable and unlikely situations for the sake of a dramatic situation or plot twist.  Like many other second-drawer mystery writers, Deaver portrays such notable organizations as the FBI, INS, US Coast Guard, and the NYPD as ridiculously inept and corruptible.  Nor has he made any attempt to research the actual policies and procedures that these organizations would follow in the situations presented in the story.  Deaver also has a poor grasp on the politics of international economics.  This is normally excusable in a mystery writer, but since Deaver sets Chinese/American economics as the foundation of his final plot twist the whole story comes crashing down in the final chapters of the novel.       A note to Deaver and other mystery writers:  it is not a requirement for a great detective to be a pompous jerk and an abrasive know-it-all.  It has been 115 years since Doyle introduced the world to Sherlock Holmes, and we have had 115 years of mediocre mystery writers plagiarizing Doyle's character.  Please try to be original.   And also, if the final "twist" in your story is so complicated and so unbelievable that you must expend two chapters in trying to explain it, perhaps it shouldn't be there in the first place.  I give this book a D.   +books
The images are unique!+P+This book was just a feature on The Sunday Morning Show. The views of Africa that this man has captured from a helicoper are very moving. I not only want to own this book I wish I could go to Washington DC and see the exhibit of the original photographs. An exhibition of Robert Haas's photographs can be viewed in National Geographic's M Street Building, October 25, 2005, to January 25, 2006. But if that is not possible buy the book+books
Mike Meyers is the only choice in computer knowledge+P+With the ever changing computers, this book is valuable in learning what is expected as a computer technician+books
One whacked witch+P+Witch is a riveting read about a woman who undoubtedly killed at least two people - her mother and her former husband. She was never  charged in the death of her ex, and she skated several years until the stench from a storage shed where she stashed the body of her mother put authorities on her trail. Puit does a nice job of tracing the steps of Brookey Lee West, a tech writer/marble reader (she claims she can read the future using marbles)/daughter of a satan worshipper. Witch was a quick read - I usually take my time with books, but this tale was compelling enough that I hardly put it down. It is somewhat gorey in spots, but well worth reading if true crime is your thing+books
More Like the Portable Associates Degree in Entrepreneurship+N+The problem with this book is that it was written as a textbook with very little practal advice and no real "know-how" methods.  Similar to virtually all business books written by professors for colleges, this book falls very short in equipping would-be entrepreneurs with the insight, skills, and know-how needed to become successful entrepreneurs.  I would not waste your money on this book at any price.    If you want a great book on the topic, I highly recommend "The Startup Company Bible for Entrepreneurs".   This little-known book is rapidly becoming THE STANDARD for entrepreneurs. +books
Short and Shallow+N+I picked this book up in order to quickly get a better understanding of Mormon history.  The Bushmans rapidly cover LDS history, but I was not satisfied with the depth of the material.  The book is pretty much a straight narrative with little attempt at interpretation or critical evaluation.  Of course, the book IS part of a series of religious history surveys for the general reader, so it is not too surprising that the Bushmans do not go very deep.  Nonetheless, at only 103 pages, they could have offered a little bit more meat to their treatment of LDS history. The first half of the book dealing with early Mormon history is the best, but far too uncritical.  (What ever happened to those golden plates revealed to Joseph Smith?)  The second half of the book starts to read like a tract put out by the Church.  It has an almost apologetic tone.  When a controversial issue is broached, like Mormon teaching about African Americans, the authors handle it very delicately.  Since the authors are both historians at Columbia, I expected better.  It almost seems that the book was slapped together, especially at the end where the Bushmans jump from topic to topic.  Having said all of that, I did learn some things from this volume, but there has got to be a better introduction to Mormon history out there.  For those interested in a more critical look at one event in Mormon history, check out &quot;Blood of the Prophets&quot; by Will Bagley+books
Give me a break+N+This book is filled with silly photographs, many of which are degrading to the dignity of animals, with a line or two on each page about &quot;the greatness of being a mom&quot; from a male author who isn't even a parent??!! Give me a break. I'm returning this+books
Less than enthralling+N+I was dismayed to find that this audio book is simply a laundry listing (in an &quot;advice o'the day&quot; format) of tidbits of wisdom. The wisdom offered is good, mind you, but if you are looking for something to stimulate and entertain you (eg on a long car ride) you will likely be disappointed. I can only listen to about 4 or 5 tidbits before I lose interest+books
Guilt Unexplained And More+N+I hoped to find a great amount of content from this Catholic Priest. I have long suffered the issues of guilt in the same religion and the fear of God was about being afraid of messing up in life rather than having a healthy fear of the Lord.  Father Tom accurately describes that guilt issue. However, instead of expressing how he found the Lord to be a forgiving God and that we are in need of accepting His grace, Tom moves into a diatribe of Panentheism and peppers most of the book with this type of theology that has proven inconsistent in and of itself. If you don't know, Panentheism is a way of explaining that &#34;Everything is in God&#34;. At the surface that sounds great. But there is more to it. It also ascribes that God is so intertwined in the creation that he cannot live apart from it. Man. That is a leap...since God is the same yesterday, today and tomorrow, and He was so BEFORE he made the earth.  OK&#62;..so you see. Tom moves away from a real answer to the guilt issue to explain a theology that has no foundation in truth.  If you want the guilt answer...doooo noooott buy this book. Instead, buy a bible. Holman Press just came out with a great one. Read the first few verses of Romans chapter 8. Then buy a couple of great commentaries that discuss them. If you want the short answer. Hear it is. &#34;We are not ever going to be good enough. And that is OK. God forgives all of us. Just accept that fact.&#34; Don't stop trying though. It helps others see the Good in GOD when they see it. Being good is not for going to heaven. It is to help show others that there is a good God to go to heaven to see!+books
WOW! I FELL ASLEEP READING+N+that was the worst novel ever.  I didn't follow the story line at all.  It seemed so random, almost like there wasn't a story line at all.  I was soooo confused with the book because I didn't see any characters except some hydrogen, cobalt, and zinc oxide.  There were so many marraiges between hydrogen and carbons and other oddly named people.  I was revolted when reading that 2 hydrogens married an oxygen.  DO NOT GET THIS BOOK.  IT IS POSSIBLY THE WORST STORY I HAVE HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO READ+books
Rusty Fiction.+N+To all who have read this malarkey, and for those who intend to, I have a suggestion. First, read all the articles by Tim Callahan of Skeptic magazine. He is an authentic scholar who specializes in debunking revisionism and bigotry. Since he like Mr. Cahill is Irish the 3-5 star reviewers will not be able to condemn him for being anti-Irish. He makes certain, unlike Cahill that he has a mountain of proof-evidence to verify his thesis. I was so impressed with his methods that it truly surprised me that some people actually fell for this book. In fact he used every point that the 1-2 star reviewers mentioned, and more. I agree with him that the entire "Hinges Of History Series" largely lacks any in depth research. The first 3 chapters of this book is devoted to rehashing what most of us learned in grade school. The next 2 chapters are clearly the authors reinterpretations of the period. The rest of the book felt padded. What does Plato have to do with the title, or premise? Where are the footnotes and sources? That makes everything dubious at best. Also, Cahill did make Archie Bunker type remarks about other groups that have no place in our society, except in a very tasteless jokebook. Read Callahan first, or in place of this rusty fiction.+books
New Historical Criticism+P+The details of everyday life in A Confederacy of Dunces add up to a complex picture of New Orleans in the early sixties.  We get a sense, as well, of the changes coming on a broader level:  the old world is passing away, and a new world is coming into being on the streets of the Quarter.  Critical Theory students at Louisiana State University are analyzing this text nine different ways, and finding a multitude of meanings.  They understand how New Historical analysis proves especially delightful and insightful+books
Very enjoyable and likeable characters+P+Everyone is comparing this follow up novel to "The Three Junes" When a novel is as perfect as that, the follow up is rarely as good. However, I enjoyed this book a great deal.  The characters were genuine and very likable. I found it easy to relate to their stories, dilemmas and decisions. I would definitely recommend it+books
Raise a Citizen!+N+If you have Kids or Grandkids, who think about politics & like "SF"; give them this book!  It was One of the many Heinlein Works that helped ME grow up.  It is the BEST & MOST IMPORTANT of his "for KIDS novels".  I ment to give it 5 Stars!!!!+books
Too painful+N+Ms. Headley really does seem to be just thrilled with herself.  That's fine, but I was far too bored with her life to want to keep reading+books
The best Mccarthy novel to read first+P+A lot has already been said about this novel, so I'll address my review to those unfamiliar with Mccarthy's work.  If you've never read Mccarthy before, this is a great place to start.  The plot is tight, engaging, and easy to follow, and the language is gorgeous.  If you enjoy this book and want to move on to others, read the others in the border trilogy before tackling "Blood Meridian."    Some people will take issue with Mccarthy's grammar, sentence structure, use of Spanish, and punctuation (or lack thereof).  Mccarthy takes a lot of poetic license with his writing, and chooses words as much for their sound as for their meaning.  The sentences are written with attention paid to rhythm and "breath," meaning that they don't always look or sound like conventional prose.  This will be displeasing to some.  As an example, the first line of the book reads:  "The candleflame and the image of the candleflame caught in the pierglass twisted and righted when he entered the hall and again when he shut the door."  Now, Mccarthy could have just as easily said "the candle flickered when he entered the room," or something like that, but the effect, aurally, is just not the same.  Read the first page of the book.  If you don't catch fire at the beauty of it, then maybe this book, and Mccarthy's work in general, is not for you+books
Lets Get to the POINT+P+Following is a 4 part review consisting of:  1) Intro and recommendations   2) Point location review   3) Meridian review   4) Action/indications review  1)  I am a first year acupuncture student at Bastyr University.  We have been using this text as the primary book for our Meridians and Points class.  It is a good text (one of the best out there for point location), and it is always undergoing revisions (got to love an author dedicated to his subject).  I also recommend the flash cards as a quick reference (a lot easier to carry around) and Trail Guide to the Body by Andrew Biel (ISBN:0965853454) to supplement your education.  2)  A Manual of Acupuncture is strong on point location with good images to help with quick reference.  Only a few discrepancies contained within the text.  Deadman usually gives clear anatomical descriptions in the text that will get you even more precisely to the point than the picture.  There are a lot of quick ways to find a point, a few of them even work, luckily Deadman stays away from most of them and chooses to give you good accurate descriptions that will be true all the time under normal circumstances.  -- pet peeve exception: LI-4 Location note gives an unclear description of using the "bulge of the muscle" to find the point.  This quick trick will have you needling in random directions in random places (some of them hurt!).  The refined version of this trick can actually be helpful... 1. Passively adduct the patient's thumb so that it contacts the palmar surface of the index finger.  2. With the hand radial side up put your finger on the highest point of the bulge (this will be near the end of the crease).  3. Release the thumb and let your finger sink down as the bulge disappears -- there you go!  After all, if you are using tricks on the major points of the body you need to make sure they work on most of the people most of the time; the rest of the time refer to Deadman's excellent text.  3) Meridians are given clearly with detailed text.  Though our instructor subscribes to a slightly different theory for some of the fine points here and there, overall I have no complaints.  Again, I love the illustrations in this book.  4)  Basic actions are given, but without much explanation of the mechanism (thank you Kyo for breaking that down); the long list of indications and a solid understanding of Chinese medicine (or good instructor) will get you on your way to figuring out possible mechanisms.  Once you understand the theory it will eliminate the confusion initially created by a long list of indications.  References are good, but you must always look beyond it an figure out why/for whom/under what conditions that prescription was written; otherwise you will be trapped by ancient dogma and modern conditions.+books
Eric, history is not supposed to be science fiction+N+Eric Hobsbawm, dedicated to applying the none too convincing idea of &quot;scientific&quot; Marxism in its traditional petrie dish of history, wields the critic's pen more like a butcher's cleaver than the rapier with which he believes, a la Don Quixote, he is thrusting. So it falls upon this reviewer to stand in faithfully as Hobsbawm's Sancho Panza. As such I appeal to you, Eric, not to begin a work of historical analysis with an invocation to an intergalactic historian, for it is the most preposterous thing I have ever encountered. Perhaps you were intrigued with the Greeks' romantic, albeit &quot;unscientific,&quot; appeal to the muse for inspiration? How else can we, your faithful followers in the pursuit of truth, justice and the human way in the study of history, explain this unhistorical incantation? Have courage, though! We know that your unwavering adherence to the &quot;scientific&quot; precepts of Marxism will excuse everything. In short, Eric, we know that you have been writing too much while watching Star Trek+books
Over blown+N+Like it or not, I sometimes wonder if an author is more loved for his image than his abilities.  Thomas Pynchon is one of those.  If the Crying of Lot 49 is his best work, or exemplary of his work, as so many say it is, then perhaps he really should find a day job, to use the cliche.  Lot 49 is an attempt at literature without any actual literature.  It's what happens when you take out plot, character, and all the other devices that make up traditional story telling.  I am very well aware that, Pynchon, like so many other authors of his era, are trying to prove that life in the modern world is soulless and meaningless.  The problem is, he is not looking hard enough to find it.  He is the literary equivalent of that cooky professor who says nothing written after 1900 is worth reading.  My answer to the professor who tried to shove that one down my throat was to hand him a dozen books worth reading that were written in the last century.  The problem is, you have to look hard to find the gems in the dross of life, and this book simply tells you that those don't exist.  Finally, the content of the book often seems pointless, and the writing is weak.  There is no forward motion, and nothing to interest a decent reader+books
Nothing special here+N+I read this short novel because I greatly admired Shaara's Pulitzer Prize winning "Killer Angels," and because I'm a baseball fan.  The novel feels more like an outline or first draft than a completed work about an aging pitcher.  It's a bit shallow and predictable in its plot.  The characters are what one expects in all too many sports novels and short stories.  The feel or atmosphere just isn't quite there.  Any baseball fan will see flaws in the book right away, flaws that distract and damage the work.  Shaara sets most of the novel in Yankee Stadium with the Hawks playing the Yankees.  Why the author chose to have one real team against a fictional team is unclear.  The Hawks apparently are from Atlanta, but an Atlanta team, Braves or Hawks, whichever, would not be playing the Yankees interleague on the next to last day of the season.  Finally, when a visiting pitcher goes out to warm up before the game, he does so in the semi-hidden bull pen down the left field line in Yankee Stadium--not on the mound on the field.  This book was published posthumously and Mr. Shaara perhaps never had a chance to polish his prose--prose that was excellent in "Killer Angels."  It's unfortunate.  There are glimmers of interest in the book, but not enough to recommend it to baseball fans or fans of the author's other book+books
Not quite what it seems+N+Nansook Hong paints a painful picture of her marriage to HyoJin Moon, but she does not own up to the full truth of her parents' machinations to get her married into the Moon family. Eyewitnesses tell of Nansook visiting the Moon household and knowing full well of HyoJin's excesses in advance of her marriage. The Hongs wanted desperately for their family to be entwined with the Moon family, and after arranging for one child to be wed to the first Moon daughter, they pushed Nansook to marry a Moon son. Though I don't know all the motives, the point is that there was an agenda behind her marriage and probably this book that Ms. Hong has not been honest about. It is only too easy to paint an unflattering portrait of Rev Moon and his wife but at least some of this is suspect, given her own deceit+books
good for a laugh+N+The book begins with Huffington complaining that her cable bill has just gone up while the CEO of her cable company just got a fat raise. Poor Huffington, the victim of ruthless greedy CEO's. Here's  an idea Arianna, dump cable and sign up with dish network or Voom or DirectTV, or just cancel service altogether, its just cable TV not oxygen. She really doesn't discuss the fact that there are such alternatives. Why are there so many alternatives to those meanies at the cable company? Because of deregulation which she bemoans as the source of all the worlds troubles in the first place. This sort of nutty reasoning is used throughout the entire book. If youre an angry lefty by all means buy this book. If you want to learn somthing, don't waste your money+books

Universal Darwinism?+P+If you like to explore provocative ideas, then you will enjoy Biocosm.  Gardner begins by arguing that a strong version of the Anthropic Principal is required to account for the goodness of fit between the physical parameters of our current universe, and the parameters required for the evolution of intelligent life.  He builds on Lee Smolin?s hypothesis (The Life of the Cosmos) that our current universe is the product of a long evolutionary history that has favored universes that could produce baby universes (in the form of black holes) and these same parameters are also favorable for intelligent life.  Gardner points out (correctly) that Smolin's hypothesis does not explain how such baby universes inherit the parameters of their mothers, and then offers a provocative solution.  It is our future intelligent progeny that program the physical laws into future universes (as they have in the past).  This is Gardner's Selfish Biocosm Hypothesis (SB).  Gardner rejects Linde's "eternal chaotic inflation" plus a weak version of the anthropic principal (ECI&WA) but it appears to me that Gardner needs Linde's idea to produce the FIRST universe with intelligent life.  After that, SB might work.  However, if ECI&WA is needed to get SB off the ground, then SB is no longer useful, since ECI&WA alone can account for the apparent goodness of fit between the parameters of the physical universe and the parameters necessary for intelligent life.  Despite my concerns, I believe Gardner's book is worth reading because it addresses some of the critical issues and constraints that confront any acceptable theory of cosmic origins+books
Very very basic information+N+If you have had to take out a mortgage to buy a house, have ever purchased life insurance or have a retirement account, this book will seem extremely basic. There aren't really any tools, worksheets or practical plans here. The book is simply a series of "Tips" -- very brief articles from different financial planners. It's a readable format, but there's not much meat.  For example, the section on "Software for Staying Organized" includes mention of only 3 software products, two of which are Microsoft Money and Intuit Quicken. The author starts her comments saying "The basic/standard versions are entry-level products designed for people new to personal finance software" (My experience with the basic versions of those programs is that they include quite powerful analysis and budgeting tools).    If you're just starting out or really need a primer, this is a readable book and comes well recommended. But if you are reasonably literate in working with lenders and insurance companies, you'll find this too simple+books
NICE INTRODUCTION TO THE LANGUAGE+P+Rated three stars only because it was not as extensive as advertised. This is an introduction to the Pimsleur method. It gives you a rudimentary sense of the Spanish language, and not much else. If, however, your interest is in the Pimsleur method and you want a good sample, this is it. A nice marketing tool! I will be ordering the Pimsleur method as a result of this teaser, so I guess it works as intended+books
Flip it!!!  ...........  Flip it good!+P+Flip the Switch is an excellent book.  I'm 29 and tired of being overweight.  I bought this book months ago.  I read half of it, then moved from Seattle to Valdez, Alaska.  All the while I was moving, I could not stop thinking about this book.  As soon as my shipment arrived, I found the book ASAP and finished it.    I have seen that some complain about the resistance products he promotes in his books.  I look at it this way:  Spend a ton of money on a gym membership or spend around $10.00 for a resistance rope - PLUS - you get to do this in the privacy of your home.  This is a great idea, especially for women that have children, a job and the home to contend with.    Jim Karas was overweight for several years.  He can relate to me.  He revels on the fact that resistance training is the way to go and thank goodness because I simply cannot handle cardio workouts due to a bad back.  The running and "stepping" in cardio is too much for me.    This is a great book for anyone but women will especially appreciate the convenience+books
More complicated than it needs to be+N+Frankly, Sex Magick is much simpler than this book would have us believe.  Masturbate to enter an altered state of consciousness over a Sigil.  Have extended periods of sex to accomplish the same goal.  Simple, no?  And, guess what?  That's all this book says, as practical information goes.  The rest is conjecture, faulty history or useless anecdote specifically there to make you impressed+books
GAVE IT ONE STAR BECAUSE I COULDN'T GIVE IT ZERO+N+There are two types of writers...one writes to inform the reader, the other writes to try to impress other writers.  Mr. Reese tried the latter, but didn't acomplish either. Reading this book is like trying to understand a sloppy drunk stranger explaining why his wife left him....it doesn't make sense and it's b-o-r-i-n-g.  It's ironic that a Frenchman with a German mother, who also spent WWII in the German Army on the Eastern Front and who never claimed to be a writer (Guy Sajer), wrote the book that is everything that Reese's book wanted to be, and isn't. If you are looking for the ultimate "can't put it down" memoir of a soldier that brings home the horrors of war along with humanity at it's best and worst, get "Forgotten Soldier" by Guy Sager.  Like Coke, it's the real thing+books
This Book Is A Must Read If You Want To Deeply Understand Persuasion+P+This is a book that you'll read over and over. You'll dog ear the pages and turn them yellow with highlighter. There is pure gold to be mined on every page.  What makes this book so valuable is the science behind persuasion that Mr. Hogan explains in easy to understand language. You walk away with a real understanding of how to persuade and why it works. In fact, I found the chapter on the impact of non-verbal communication to be worth the whole price of the book and even more. After I read this book, I was surprised it wasn't priced in the $80 range like many of the other persuasion books.  This book should be considered a primer for everyone who wants to seriously persuade. Get it, read it, use it, persuade, profit.+books
Powerful +P+This is an incredible true story of a man passionate to reach for Christ those who have never heard. It also clearly illustrates the darkness, evil and despair that comes from idolatry. But it also shows the true liberation and freedom that can come only for Christ. This book will draw you in from the first page.   The world needs more people like Stan. People who are willing to trust solely in God and how are willing to go to dangerous remote areas to share Christ. This book will shatter your complaceny and force you to think. I highly recommend this book. For all Christians, but especially those (like me) who have  heart for missions. This book details the good, the bad, and the ugly of missions work.+books
War and Peace+P+I got strange looks when people spotted me reading War and Peace. Not many 14 year olds took on the challenge. Yet I did, and enjoyed myself immensely. If you read it in a public place, you'll most likely get funny looks for reading the very complicated unabridged book. And I can assure you that you will most likely enjoy yourself almost as much as I did.  "War and Peace" tells of many different characters, goes through their lives, and describes the very complicated connections they all have with each other. It is a huge book, and for the first two hundred pages, one can't even tell someone what the book is "about", because it's not quite clear. But then it does become clear, and it all starts making wonderful sense. You can't help but fall in love with some of the characters and the way they act, because they're such special characters, and it feels as though you truly know them. Despite its length, this book is totally worth it; worth the time, the effort, the headaches, the angry mutterings about things not going your way... It's worth everything.+books
A lovely book+P+The lilting prose and alternating black-and-white and colorful illustrations make this one of my favorite books to read to my little one.  There is a reason this book is a classic+books
Oh, Eve!+P+Book #23 in the In Death Series. This book had the potential to be the best in the series.  But Eve's ever increasing sensitivity issues made ruined it's perfection. As the Swisher family is brutally murdered in their sleep, their is a lone survivor and witness, their young daughter Nixie. In the beginning Eve embraces the child reluctantly when she finds her in the home hiding.  You feel Eve can relate to her terror.  Then when Eve brings the child into her home to protect her, she does everything she can to alienate the kid.  COME ON!  I thought Eve was growing and then she takes a giant leap back.  It was just a little to over the top for me.  Too much lack of compassion.  Thank goodness for Raorke and Sommerset.  The mystery is top notch, and Peabody is back on the job.   I just wish Eve would take some sensitivity classes.  Other than that another excellent book. +books
Simple. Straight-Forward. Practical. Helpful.+P+The "Bird Flu Preparedness Planner" delivers what it promises in a clear, compelling, straight-forward way. Dr. Woodsen lays out the facts of this health threat with no hype and no panic. However, it is real, it is deadly, and it is heading our way.  The most valuable feature of this slim, easy-to-read manual, is its simplicity and practicality for preparedness. It has checklists of supplies, medicines, and food a family would need in case of a severe epidemic or pandemic. I will try to get Tamiflu (to help with ordinary strains of influenza) and the over-the-counter remedies he recommends.  I think the food list could have been a bit more comprehensive. I plan to have more than rice and potatoes on hand to feed a family of six for eight weeks. However my grocery list looks more like a summer cookout for a family reunion than an emergency stash. I suppose 8 cases of baked beans and 8 summer sausages is a little over-the-top.+books

The Third Secret: A Novel of (not that much) suspense+N+The Third Secret is another entry in the Vatican intrigue genre. It has the usual elements: Vatican conservatives the usual bad guys vs liberal Catholics the usual good guys. The "Third Secret" refers to secret revelations given to Marian visionaries at such places as Fatima and Medjugorge, the existence of which is historical fact. If there is any suspense in the novel, it is not with the plot which is remarkably predictable and derivative. The only thing that kept my interest was waiting to find out the actual content of the third secret(s), at least according to the novel's author. In the end, these proved to be rather predictable too, given the author's religious inclinations+books
Rehash of a second rate sci-fi horror movie+N+Walter Mosley's "Easy Rawlins" series is well plotted, the characters are well thought out, and the stories are very original. I am a fan of his new "Fearless Jones" series, which does a lot to  explain racism in 1950s Los Angeles.  Nothing I've read about Walter Mosley explains why he would want to write this piece of trite.  This book is the worst rehash of bad 1950s sci-fi movies that I've read in years.  I've been reading sci-fi for forty years and this is about as bad as it gets.  The story is totally trash, you know the ending before you get past the beginning, the characters are ridiculous, and the sex scenes are even worse (hard to ruin sex, but he does it).    If this was by anyone else it never would have gotten published. It would be a favor to him and all his fans to buy back every copy that exists and bury them+books
Very disappointing+N+This is the story of Cassie, who is found wandering helplessly in a cemetery by a young Indian policeman who just arrived in LA. Cassie suffers from amnesia and we don't know what brought her there, until a hollywood megastar recognizes her as his wife.  This is by far the most disappointing of Picoult's books, and I've read almost all of them and am a big fan of hers. Cassie is amnesic, yet she does remember stuff and it is not clear at all in the book how comes she recovers from her amnesia or actually how it happened. The story goes back and forth between the present, the past, the memories, and leaves readers lost in the middle.  I was surprised by other reviewers who were surprised by the ending. Chapter one gives the ending away in my opinion. What is frustrating is that it takes Picoult 350 pages to make her character realise the obvious.  I also found Cassie to be unreliable and unappealing, let alone her husband Alex, a massive egocentric. The story was very confused, mixing hollywood lifestyle with movie sets in Africa, with anthropology, Indian legends, domestic violence, alcoholism, amnesia - it was just too much for one book and the message was confused.   If you want a superb story of domestic violence, read Black & Blue by Anna Quindlen. If you want a good Picoult book, read The Pact or My Sister's Keeper, but definitely not Picture Perfect+books
a must have+P+This great little book is full of easy juicing recipes. Another good thing about this book is that Jay goes into detail about the vast, enormous benefits of a raw foods vegan diet. I am not a raw foodist, but as a vegan it is wonderful that Jay informs people who buy this book who may not be Vegan the simple fact that one can easily get calcium from other sources than cows milk. I have had a juicer for two years and still refer back to this book from time to time+books
Maria-Yokohama, JAPAN+P+This book is a MUST read.

Pretty language but couldn't stay awake+N+This novel is comprised of pretty, well constructed sentences.  That's about all it is.  Pretty, well constructed sentences.  The story itself could be interesting, after all it is a tale of multi-generational abandonment but it is told so dispassionately that it was difficult to remain interested, let alone awake.  The narrator, although the main character, was so far removed, emotionally, from her own telling of the story, that you wondered why she had bothered.    At time it seems that the writer was so enthralled with her own use of language that she seemed to forget that there was a story that needed to be told. +books
Why does Updike ignore women artists? +N+I find it disturbing that John Updike can apparently find no female artist worthy of mention in his book...beyond one artist who is practically unknown. And she is included only because his family owned a piece of artwork created by her. Updike seems very dismissive of even this one female contributor.  He does find room in his book to include a nude photo of the great artist Georgia O'Keefe, but no actual artwork created by O'Keeffe. That should give you a clue what the rest of the book is like.   Disturbing, too, are Updike's dismissive comments about Edward Hopper; he claims that Edward Hopper can't paint faces very well.    So even though I purchased this book, I don't recommend it to others. Give this one a pass.+books
Meaning of epiplectic+P+My Dad bought me this wonderful little book when I was young, & I have always loved the truly off-center humor of it. In response to the query about the meaning of epiplectic, I found a quick online search produced the same type of results as reviewer RHS got--mostly references to epileptic & apoplectic. Oddly, I have a clear memory of looking it up decades ago (one of my father's favorite admonitions was "look it up!") and finding a definition that related it to apoplectic, and described it as referring to something that suddenly and somewhat violently falls to pieces. In fact I have often cited 'epiplectic' as an apt description when watching the Blues Brothers' faithful retired police car burst into bits once they make Daley Plaza, LOL--so this definition, though unconfirmable at the moment, has been clearly emblazoned in my memory for these many years (right or not)! Now if I could just find that dictionary of my Dad's to confirm..+books
95% of us need this book+P+The successful companies are not afraid to confront the problem when it arises and discuss it rationally.  Even though directed more toward a business or office atmosphere, the same techniques can be applied  to family and friends.  The example stories cover a broad array of possible circumstances, which will help when conversations turn crucial (or critical).   The chapters flow well, with a touch of humor.  The skills can be easily learned.  Chapters 1-2 are an introduction; Chapters 3-9 details how to use each skill;  Chapters 10-12 is a summary and contains advanced study tools.  The authors believe good communication skills (talking, listening and acting together) start with the heart.  To some these skills may seam obvious, but they are also meant to boost or to rid ourselves of years of bad habits.  They will then become more conscience as practiced.  First is to recognize we need this book.  Then we need to utilize it and build our communication skills to make them habits.  I believe it is safe to say that most who pick this book up will come away with an improvement in some area.  "To improve is to change; to be perfect is to change often" --- Winston Churchil+books
Don't Bother!+N+It's too bad that Clive Cussler changed collaborators on his "Oregon Files" series.  This was terrible!  I couldn't even finish it.  I read a lot in all different genres so I feel that I'm a little qualified to comment on a book I have read.  It dragged, some of the characters were changed and even though I know you have suspend disbelief, I couldn't keep my eyes open.  Golden Buddha and Sacred Stone were much better+books
I wanted to like this book so badly...+N+...because I thought White Oleandar was brilliant. But this book? Not so much. I would not be surprised if Paint it Black were something Fitch wrote before she got her bestseller published. It felt much less fully realized. I found the text to be sprawling, unedited, self-indulgent. I generally have no problem with unreliable and/or unlikable narrators, but this one was more tiring than she was menacing. The whole book was written in one note, so I, too, agree with the "flat" description. I found the characters (the distant, brilliant, rich mother; the sassy best friend; the beautiful, troubled boyfriend) to be very stock and borderline cliche. I absolutely savored every word of Fitch's first book; reading this one, unfortunately, was like returning to a restaurant where you'd had the most amazing creme brulee of your life, only to find it cold and runny the second time you ordered it.+books
If only...+P+If everyone in the world read this book just once, it would be such a more enjoyable place to live in..+books
He almost had me convinced.+N+De Soto's work was viewed by economists, historians, and politicians alike as breakthrough.  He gives us an in-depth look at the Lima's informal sector and postulates, much to the satisfaction of his Washington, D.C.  bankroll, that Peruvians are bursting to embrace democracy and market  capitalism.  Unfortunately, he has twisted Peru's real scenario to reflect  what Washington wants to hear.  In reality, Lima's informal sector is  merely a way for a depraved population to survive, not a radical shift  toward capitalism.  De Soto's Institue for Liberty and Democracy was funded  almost in full by Washington, and the man himself has spent more time in  the U.S. than in Peru.  This book leans more toward American propaganda  than objective analysis.  An interesting read, but only with abundant  grains of salt+books
I'm returning this book+N+I bought this book based on its rating. Unfortunately, virtually every page of this book is half blank. Furthermore, there are many unnecessary blank lines within the text page. The format of this book is like for third grade. Also, the author uses Java code along with his text. But at the end of each chapter, he uses C code as a duplication of the Java code.    If you want to know and learn Design Patterns, make sure you look at &quot;Software Architecture Design Patterns in Java&quot; by Partha Kuchana. This book covers 42 design patterns including the 23 GoF patterns. Also, you might like to look at &quot;Core J2EE Patterns&quot; Second Edition by Alur, Crupi, amd Malks+books

Where de Soto started - a brave statement+P+I love the little jibe provided within the title of Hernando de Soto's "The Other Path."  It's a poke at "The Shining Path" (Sendero Luminoso), the Maoist Peruvian terrorist organization that wreaked havoc on de Soto's homeland beginning in 1980.  de Soto's attempt in this book is to show that the more effective struggle is to make capitalism more efficient.  To those who know de Soto's work, the solutions are well known: build a system of laws that allow one's residents to buy, sell and value property rights; and reduce the complexities and banalities of starting a business.  If you've read de Soto's master work "The Mystery of Capitalism," then there is no new news here.  In fact, "The Other Path" will look out-of-date with its yellowing statistics.  So why the five stars?  As a testament to de Soto's bravery.  Think about the guts it took for him to research and publish this book in Peru during the tumultuous and frightening period there.  What a statement.+books
These Bleachers are HARD!+N+I was very disappointed in this selection.  Maybe a MALE football fanatic would find something appealing, but I was VERY bored!  Take me back to court, to the lawyer's office, to the judge's chambers,...just about anywhere but these bleachers!!+books
Anwar El-Sadat on the Road to Jerusalem.+P+This is an autobiography that describes How Saadat decided to come to the Knesset in the interests of Egypt and The Middle East.

Also recommend his wifes Book that came out after One of the most Tragic Assasinations in recent History. +books
A Standard of the Profession+P+By anyone's standars, the CMDT annuals have to be considered among the best in the business, and for several reasons.   First, the annual review cycle keeps them up to date.   Second the fact that this is now the 46th edition means that they have had plenty of time to work out the details as to what to include and how to find it.   Third, each major section is written by specialists in that particular area, specialists who have worked in that area, and on this book for years.   Fourth is the size. The new edition is almost 2,000 pages long. It covers just about everything an internal medicine specialist is supposed to know.   Fifth, CDMT on-line which includes the entire book, plus several thousand addional pages, 1200+ images, drug information, patient handouts and much more.   Sixth, for such a book, this one is surprisingly inexpensive.   All in all, this is the book by which others are compared.+books

Simply the best+P+This is without hesitation the best book on CSS I have ever read. Furthermore this book will make me reread the other CSS books I have so that I may at last grasp all the techniques hidden in them behind all the mumbo jumbo (you know when the author says "do it that way because it's the way it's done" - really meaning that's the way he does it but never explaining why he does it).  A must buy.+books
can't put it down!!+P+These stories are all magnificent.  They are some of the most beautifully written pieces pf literature I've ever read.  Nearly perfect in every respect+books
Insightful!+P+The death of the New Economy has been greatly exaggerated. That's the message at the heart of Sandra Vandermerwe's new book. While the heady valuations of the late `90s are history, the fundamental changes that technology inspired during that time are here to stay. With that in mind, Vandermerwe presents analyses of tools that business leaders need to survive into the 21st century. The most insightful of these is a breakdown of customer feedback loops and how they can be harnessed to lock in business. The book can't avoid many of the shortcomings that pervade most New Economy literature, like the tendency to advise readers to remake their businesses in anticipation of future customer needs - without commenting on how exactly that can be achieved. Nevertheless, if you're a manager who suspects that the innovations of the last decade might still play a key role in the growth of business, we [...] recommend this book to you+books
Lightweight and disappointing+N+This guide to culinary careers is terribly overpriced for the information it contains. The quick descriptions of different culinary careers have some value, as do the appendices listing culinary publications and organizations. However, the career descriptions are quite short and the advice is unremarkable. On the topic of finding a culinary mentor, for example, the author advises you to find one. That's pretty much it - no discussion on how to choose a suitable mentor, or how to convince an experienced professional to take you on as a protege. The book mentions the apprenticeship system but doesn't explain how to find an apprenticeship. The section on choosing a culinary school/vocational program is much better, though.  Something trumpeted in both the book description here and on both covers of the actual book is the inclusion of up-to-date information on salary statistics and earning potential for the spectrum of culinary professionals. It must have been printed in invisible ink, because I don't see it *anywhere* (and yes, I have this exact edition). This promise was my primary motivation for getting the book, so I was very disappointed (disgruntled, even) that this information is NOT in the book after all.  Don't spend money on this book unless you're just looking for a quick overview of the career possibilities. That's the one thing the author does well - it describes (in brief) a wide range of culinary careers beyond the obvious white-linen restaurant ones.  This book could have been greatly improved if it had expanded on the career descriptions, perhaps including short interviews with actual culinary professionals, especially those in roles like institutional cooking or food research. Of course it also would have been much better if it had actually included the promised salary information, too.  It's a good book to have in a library or career center, but it's not much use for your home reference bookshelf+books
Readalbe but junky+N+Timeline is equivalent to a 99 cent taco. It's an indulgent bit of junk food. Timeline starts with a Hillerman-esque scientist turning up in the middle of New Mexico - an intriguing idea, but goes to the land of mediocracy right after that filled with cartoon characters. There are so many preposterous story elements that it's just really difficult to take seriously. The story is ever-predictable and ludicrous. But, a 99 cent taco is worth the effort if you're real hungry. Go back and read Andromeda Strain.+books
Impressive, but not useful+N+I bought the Moosewood Restaurant Low-Fat Favorites Cookbook by the Moosewood Collective and put out by Clarkson Potter Publishers in 1996, because I'd heard that this was a famous vegetarian restaurant chain with great food, and knew about it since the "headquarters" restaurant is located in Ithaca, New York, where I went to school.    At first, the recipes, such as Mushroom Polenta Pie, looked pretty good to me and not too hard to make, but beyond that, I found that a great deal of Asian-inspired recipes, including Five Spice Rice and Lentil Sambar were too exotic and complicated to make for my taste, and the costly ingredients for various dinner recipes were often hard to find at my non-upscale, local grocery store.  Though I liked Moosewood's recipe for "oven fries," I could have easily gotten that off the internet.    And many Moosewood recipes just started looking time-consuming.  Have I really wanted to make complicated Tunisian potato turnovers involving no less than 14 ingredients for my dinner on any weekday?  Not really.  The curried sweet potato roti recipe needs 19 ingredients and the tamale pie asks for an astounding 26.    So, on the whole, I was disappointed with this book.  Though I'm sure the restaurant food is pretty tasty because Moosewood shows it knows how to flavor vegetables in innovative ways, I don't recommend this book to people who need simple tasty, vegetable meals on a daily basis while on the go.  This book might be more useful for entertaining guests on weekends, when you have more time and are feeling more adventurous+books
Insightful review - by Jameson Thottam+P+I purchased this book as a good primer for entering banking (specifically IndyMac Bank).  When I joined retail banking (previously only having worked in Investment Banking at Morgan Stanley) I was able to expand my knowledge on various areas of the retail banking beyond just what I-Banking had taught (e.g.,, valuation, SEC II & SEC III stat techniques, tax implications and flippying and insider trading tips of how to find/negotiate the best properties).    I would highly recommend this book to others in this field.  - Jameson Thottam+books

Are the authors qualified to write this book?+N+It does not seem that Thomas Pauley is particularly rich.  One of his best success stories is getting a good loan rate so he could buy a used Mercedes that had 55,000 miles on it.   That's rich?!  It seems that if he were "rich beyond his wildest dream" he would pay cash for for any new car available and not think twice about it.  There is also a fair amount of nutty ideas like "If most of the world believed in fairies, unicorns and mermaids, you would see them running around all of time." One of the most objectionable ideas is his concept of tithing.  He makes God out to be some sort of cosmic accountant that will strike back at you is he does not get his 10%. Additionally Mr. Pauley's concept of tithing is very specific. According to Mr. Pauley giving to a church or charity is not tithing. Giving 10% to a rock star because you are inspired by his lyrics is fine (as in the case of his son).  If fact he would say that giving to poor people would be "foolish spending".  You should tith to your spiritual source. I get the distinct impression that he wants me to kick back 10% to him.   There are a few good ideas like make lists and get specific about your goals but it is never followed up by an action plan.  You should just put in your order and wait for the universe to fill it.  Mr Pauley covers himself with a hugh loophole which is, if this system didn't work for you it means that the universe didn't want you to have it.   I suggest Napolin Hill's "Think and Grow Rich"  instead.      +books
effortful but...+N+This book is a pioneering effort to simplify network analysis for the unitiated but... there are too many eccentricities and mistakes for this tome to be taken seriously as either  a technical guide (see Wasserman and Faust) or a sociological simplification+books
Incredible reference book and work of art.+P+NO Pagan, Witch, Occulist, Magickian or Philosopher should be without this book. There is NO EXCUSE. This is the most phoenomenal book of its kind. JMG must have spent years creating this. I have never found a more helpful, clear yet complete guide for the Occult sciences and all things Pagan. This cleared more things up for me than many other books ever could. This is brilliant. Pick up a copy; you will be thrilled that you did+books
A must read+P+This is a tremendously informative and well written book. Short and to the point and in a language that anybody can understand, it should be required reading for anyone vaguely interested in the economic future of America and, indeed, the whole world. Mr. Brown's book is not a populist war cry but a sensible and well reasoned debunking of all the "free trade" rhetoric one normally hears.  One warning: This book may well leave the reader angry with the status quo! +books
Another Great Oregon Files Book!+P+You will not be disappointed as Juan Cabrillo and his crew aboard the Oregon once again take center stage in this, the 3rd book in the Oregon Files series.  This series has had my attention from the beginning as the idea of an entire crew of "heroes" headed by Cabrillo is a fresh new twist on Cussler's long history of sea-going adventures starring either Dirk Pitt or Kurt Austin.  This series allows the Cussler enthusiast yet another new book to look forward to on a regular basis.  Long live Juan Cabrillo and the Oregon!!!+books
The "Spiritual Path"+P+Like it or not, we are all on a spiritual path, consciously or unconsciously!  Our minds deem it "difficult", but in truth, we are spirits having a human experience, not humans having a spiritual experience.  With this in mind, this author's book is a stellar, yet gentle, reminder to get out of our heads, and into our spiritual heritage.  Much of what he writes makes me do just that: "Oh yes, I know that, thank you for reminding me yet once again!"  So much of this book resounds deeply in my heart. We all need this gentle reminding, no matter what stage we think we've achieved on this journey. This book is written with light-hearted-ness that makes me smile, and pick up it up once again for pick-me-ups.Keener Jansse+books
Not Recommended+N+Having read (and thoroughly enjoyed) Levitt's Freakonomics, I picked up "Hidden Order: The Economics of Everyday Life" looking for more of the same. Unfortunately, I was sadly disappointed.   I get the impression the author intended to write a Freakonomics-type book, but was only able to come up with 40 pages of material (located at the end of the book). Facing an irate publisher, he then filled in the initial 290 pages with his old Economics lecture notes. As a result, readers who have taken an elementary economics course will find much of the material repetitive, while those who have not will most likely find the material too confusing to be of any real use. (Despite the glowing accolades on the cover, the author's explanations are no better than those available in a standard textbook.)  The author also posits end-of-chapter questions for the reader to ruminate upon, but does not provide any answers. Aside from formal textbooks where such questions are intended to be assigned to students, such tactics are unconscionable. Of course, the author may be priming the pump for sales of a "Hidden Order Supplement".  A final negative point is the author's tone, which is frequently condescending towards the reader (e.g. telling the reader they would not understand the math behind a given theory, so it will not even be presented). While this may be true for a layperson reading the book, being talked down to certainly does nothing to build their confidence or cultivate their interest in the subject matter.  Overall, if you can borrow a copy from a friend or a library, the last 40 pages are worth reading. Otherwise, save your time and money.  Reviewer's background: B.Sc. (Computing Science & Mathematics) M.B.A. (Finance & Marketing) Ph.D. (Finance)+books
Packed with Knowledge !+P+Economist Joseph A. Schumpeter's keen intellect makes some of today's scholarship sound like the spouting of ideology on talk shows. Some consider him the greatest economist of the twentieth century. Only an intellect of his towering stature would be able to present a case that while Marx was wrong about how capitalism would collapse, he was probably correct that it eventually would. Schumpeter also contends that socialism may eclipse free-market economies, news he feels society should greet with angst. He believed that capitalism's doom would proceed not from a revolution by an angry proletariat, but rather as a result of successes that would give rise to a class of elites who would gradually institute systems of central control. Fully understanding this complex, although non-mathematical, treatise may require some background; it is not a book for the novice. While this 1942 classic may seem dated in spots, those who conclude that it is time to tap dance on socialism's grave should consider that Schumpeter expected socialism's dominance to take a century or more. We recommend this classic to anyone seeking a deeper understanding of the historic, economic case for the rise of socialism+books
This book should instruct you on the tactics of the subservise opponents of democracy+N+Books of political position ought be fact ridden.  They should move you to the author's point of view, if not the author's conclusions, by marshalling facts first; then an author can supply analysis constrained by supplied facts.  Only then should we be given some further speculation, unless moving directly to reasoned conclusions.  Mr. Horowitz does none.  Instead he starves us for facts.  He substitutes instead only editorial cant.  I can conclude only that he aspires to persuade no one.  The audience is not the inquiring, the undecided or the doubting.    For example, he contrasts, on the first page the Iraq war as "so successful in its results.",  with the Vietnam conflict as an unsatisfactory result -- renaming in the process what we thought to be a war.  Mr. Horowitz insists on weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.  He states explicitly and blanketly that the execution of American power is a bulwark of national security.  He insists that American Presidents have been either the toys or the allies of terrorists.  I kept waiting for evidence of any kind.  He even says the twin towers were destroyed in only minutes, yet were more important than Pearl Harbor.  My guess is that WW II was not so cheap or unworthy.  Neither were the more than sixty boys from my high school killed in the World Trade Center; at least I can reference Time magazine as the source.  Mr Horowitz cheapens their deaths by saying it was the work of Democrats allied with moslems in their struggle with the Neo-conservatives whose birthright is the unfettered use of American soldiers and guards.    Mr. Horowitz has plenty of notes of a sort.  Many are only self-referential as opposed to supportive from other sources.  He quotes the New York Review of Books, but leaves out words he does not like.  Oddly he describes 9/11 as putting the Bush administration "on the run".  He probably meant something else, but is simply incapable of precision and accuracy in general.  I cannot even recommend the book to those who oppose his purposes because they are so incoherently hysterical+books
If I could choose 0 stars, I would. +N+I recently borrowed this as an audiobook from the library because I need something to occupy my mind while I scan microfiche at work (boooorrring). I actually haven't finished this book yet, but up until what I listened to tonight, I hadn't made my mind up yet on how I felt about it. I was going to see it though, but now I'm not sure if I will.  I don't even know where to start about what I don't like about this book.  Before starting this book, Ms. Picoult should have spent a little more time researching laws and procedure regarding kidnappings, especially proceedings following such a great span of time. I'll be the first to admit that I don't know much about law, but it seems quite unrealistic that Delia's father Andrew Hopkins (or should I say Charles Matthews?) would be placed in maximum security prison in a matter of a week. I find it hard to believe that on his first day, he would get beaten and practically raped (I can't remember if he was or not). I could be wrong, but if 28 years have passed, wouldn't the statute of limitations passed, and even if they hadn't, wouldn't the mother need to press charges in order for anything to happen? And wouldn't it mean something that they were in a different state?  Now, even though everyone else seemed to love her, Delia was incredibly annoying (and the actress who read her "monologues" in the audio version was equally annoying). Women authors tend to make their female protagonists characters that supposedly have a lot of depth that usually have several men in love with her. I have seen many women in real life who pretend that they have this effect on men, but rarely ever do. It just seems like a fantasy of Picoults, and a very boring one at that. Ah, a love triangle, gee, like THAT's never been done before. One instance that sticks out is when Delia gets upset that Eric (her fiancee and her fathers attorney) doesn't tell her about a court appearing, however, Eric didn't even find out until ten minutes before it was about to happen. But, even the premise for that is questionable: would that really happen? I mean seriously!  I also hated how the book shifted "voices" -- this is not a play, I don't want to read monologues describing the same events from a different perspective. I didn't feel as though it was necessary to divide this book into several characters. I half expected a chapter to be from Sophie (Delia's four year old daughter) perspective. I could really do without the exaggerated and unrealistic jail scenes or the indian lore. I also hated how the entire book seemed to be composed of different memories or thoughts that really made no sense, and then later incorporated into the passage, also not making sense. For example, Eric narrates this dream he had about Sondra, who is some beautiful girl he imagined. She turns into a rabbit and runs into a bush. Later, Ruthann tells a story about a rabbit that shoots the sun with a bow and arrow and causes the earth to burn up. Somehow he connects the two because of the rabbit, when really they have no cohesive connection. Also, between the three childhood friends (Delia, Eric and Fitz) they talk about their memories constantly, as if that is the only thing that binds them together. Real friendships don't compromise of only discussing things that happened to them in the past... but it does in this book, because the author so desperately wants you to know that they are a really close group of friends. To me, it just seems pretentious.  What's also pretentious is the various passages that are supposed to reveal some new idea about life but really make no sense at all. One passage I remember is when Delia is talking to Fitz about memories and she suggests that maybe everyone has the same memories already in the head from when they are born, and maybe they remember things that never happened to them. I might have that a little wrong, because it's a bit confusing. It's confusing because it makes absolutely no sense. It doesn't even feel like it's remotely TRYING to make sense at all! The book is full of little things like this that just feel pseudo-intellectual, like Picoult is forcing her characters to have depth when they really want to be stereotypical.  All of the characters seem a little edgy and totally basket cases. Delia gets incredibly upset for not remembering what her life was when she was FOUR YEARS OLD. For goodness sakes woman, I have maybe 2 or 3 memories from when I was four years old or younger, and most of them don't make sense except for the fact that I know what my parents have told me. By the way she acts, you'd think she was 12 when she was kidnapped.  Also, she seems to recover memories all the time... man, I wish I could do that. It just seems a bit implausible, that's all.  The book is saturated in gooey, sappy imagery, metaphors, anecdotes, memories, subplots, and so on. I am not so quick to totally bash an author, but it's this type of pretentious writernese dribble that I loathe. If I wanted some sappy, melodramatic dimestore paperback I would have read one of those instead. I expected better from the synopsis on the back cover. Overall, and I say overall without even finishing the book (I haven't even gotten to the meth lab part with the father yet, but it sounds pretty ridiculous), that this is definitely one of the most horrible books I've ever read, bar none. Do yourself a favor and skip this one... and definitely don't pick up the audiobook. The voice actors and actresses are incredibly annoying to listen to+books
Doss writes another winner in his Shaman series+P+Another in James D. Doss' Shaman series which began with The Shaman Sings in the mid 1990s. The series started off good and just keeps getting better. Doss marries a wry writing style with well-drawn characters, a clever story line and a fine understated humour. His setting is southern Colorado, a land of ranchers, wide spaces and capable country people both matukach (white) and Ute Native Americans.   The Shaman of the series, wise old Ute Daisy Perika, doesn't feature to the extent that she has in other books in the series but her contribution via dreams and premonitions is subtle and true. Her character is the stuff the series is built on. She is abrasive and annoying, and takes pleasure in being so, yet the writer has made her irascible while  likeable and she is the character the reader will remember long after the rest are forgotten.   The story's central character is Charlie Moon, nephew of Daisy Perika and a Ute rancher and sometime policeman for his tribe. Charlie's major trouble in life is a mountain cat terrorising his ranch workers and cattle, until he is asked to find out who injured a U.S. Senator and at the same time killed Billy Smoke, the Senator's driver. The Senator, who runs the neighbouring ranch, has his own agenda and Charlie finds himself also involved in investigating a leak of damaging government information from the Senator's ranch.  Charlie finds himself often on the tricky side of guns and dangerous animals (both human and not). It makes for a rollicking and thoroughly enjoyable read.   No sex but some violence+books
Great for teachers of drama too!+P+Not only useful for the &quot;serious adult&quot; improv artist--as a drama teacher who works with underprivileged kids I find this the best book out there for helping them develop a sense of &quot;mastery&quot; on stage, a drama more alive to them than memorizing lines.  Recommended for anyone who works with young actors+books
Not a single false note in coming-of-age novel+P+K.M. Soehnlein did not strike a single false note for me in his coming-of-age novel. The non-linear nature of many conversations (which still communicate much to both the listeners AND the speakers), the guilt and excitement that a person feels when he continues to experience life during tragic circumstances, the way a series of bold decisions suddenly add up to a life spinning wildly out of control: all of these ring true to me.  The protagonist Robin McKenzie is destined for greater things than his suburban New Jersey town can give him -- he's smart, creative, and hungry -- but we're lucky to have a peak into the half-year when his life and identity are transformed (unfortunately, by an accident when childhood teasing gets out-of-hand).   The book is written for adults, although older teenagers might be ready for it. I imagine that some high school gays will dog-ear certain hot sections for re-reading. I would have done so had I stumbled on such a book when I was in high school. Wait, I did ...  **SPOILER**  And for once in recent fiction, a gay relationship in high school is shown to be the intoxicating, confusing, educational and FINITE experience that it often is.   I look forward to reading more from K.M. Soehnlein+books
A Timeless Classic+P+To compose a book set in a particular nation when you yourself belongs to a different country,it's forever going to be an issue of debate on whether your interptretation of the culture is authentic or not. Then again,your own comprehension of the nation is put under a cloud. And reliability of your understanding is a major factor. Thus a novel which transcends the national boundaries and cultural restrictions is always a rare item of literature in an equally scantily elemented realm of art but Pearl Sydenssstricker Buck's Pulitzer Prize winning book "The Good Earth" set against the backdrop of a China for which the 20th. century revolution were distant rumblings of the dim future. This is a timeless,evergreen classic dressed in a transparent,empathic language and a finely woven plot which conspire to guise  this dark story in a lighter hue.  Wang Lung is a mediocre farmer ploughing his life through difficult times in KIangsu and around him "The Good Earth" revolves. Pearl S. Buck might be an American but in her adroit tracing of the trajectory of Wang Lung's life across a vast sky of deceitful times in China,the reader fathoms the mark of a gifted writer who has come to spearhead American literature. The authoress etches a great picture of Wang Lung and the plethora of incidents which provide testimony to him being led on by life's waves. Wang Lung marries a slave from the House of Hwangs,O-Lan,and along with her undergoes umpteen adventures and misadventures in life and witnesses its numerous dimensions.  Ove a period spanning a lifetime,Wang Lung and O-Lan travel to and fro the dual extermities of knee-deep poverty and exotic richness and therein eflect changes in character. The farmer and his wife along with their three sons and two daughters suffer abject povety when their village is cursed by drought and famine in such a degree that they're reduced to consuming even their ox. In search of better prospects,the protagonist takes his family to town where beggary is the sole mean to make both ends meet.  In Anhwei,Wang Lung confronts bleak situations and finds himself nothing short of a foreigner in his own country,amidst his compatiots. Lung fathoms a thick delineation between the rich and the poor and finds his own rustic background a crippling factor for him to blend with the townsfolks. This is a plight that is not only shared by other villagemen who've taken compatible measures as Lung to earn their living in the town but also by uncountable such uneducated masses around the world in all ages who flock to a different landscape in hunt for better scope and in this symbolism abodes the book's universal appeal.  Wang Lung's adventures in town get him enough money and when he returns to his home village,he's already a prospering man. He buys land and cultivates myriad crops on them and gradually steps up the ladder of success and ultimately reaches the pinnacle when he and his large and everbranching family start residing in the House of Hwang,the symbol of traditional landlords. But his monetary success comes at the cost of his moral notions as Wang Lung's conscience,despite sustaining honesty throughout,gets absorbed in preposterous wealthy,aristrocatic fashions. Lung emains unwary of his selfless,dedicated,devoted but ugly wife,"a woman such as it is not commonly found",O-Lan and keeps mistress and is so absurdly misled by illusions and fakes. The reader deciphers in Lung a man of basic and simple foundations,at times queerly naive,tainted by misapprehensions.  "The Good Earth" may be the moving tale of Chinese farmer Wang Lung and his wife O-Lan but this is not by any purpose singular or mundane in nature. Pearl S. Buck mirrors an essentially conservative and reserved Chinese society in this her prize winning novel but,all the same ,hypocratic and deeply soaked in grotesque traditionalism. The disgraceful customs of slave trade and perception of a wife as "a faithful servant" are a couple of features highlighted by the authoress which reverberate even today in several culturs. "Have you not heard it said that in the Sacred Edicts it is commanded that man is never to correct an elder?" The stucture of the plot has a certain symmetry about it and follows a more traditional yrt consolidatory paradigm occasioned with ghastly images of poverty,self-denial and self-improvement.  But for all the exemplars Pearl S. Buck's book launches,it's not without its fair share of dewfects. A number of flaws is given the go-ahead in as early as the seventh page when the authoress remarks about "silver dollars" in Wang Lung's village. This is a technical blunder as dollar was not a common item there then. Again,the authoress is shrunk and limited in her descrioptions of a harrowing picture where sge could've been more elaborate:"Then O-Lan crept out and she took a great iron knife she had in the kitchen and she cut a grat gash in the beast's neck,and thus she served its life. And she took a bowl and caught its blood to cook for them to eat in a pudding,and she skinned and hacked to pieces the great carcass.....". This restrained sentimentality and employment of economy of words take the sting out of the tail really.  Even so,these blemishes don't overshadow at all the forcce and sensibility of the book. The mazing facet about Pearl S. Buck is the conviction in her language bordering on a gentle assurance of an unique tale. "The Good Earth" is an immensely haunting Pre-revolutionary China novel and is extensively ambitious. The writer merges familial and social lives and interlaces them with echoes of the past,regular rhythm of the present and disturbing notions of the future. "But there was no peace" is a catchphrase rippled throughout the book in various overtones,be it in Wang Lung's father's placidity,in his own distress,in the distant hints of a revolution or in the first signs of Christian infiltration in China. In Lung's craze for land,the reader would observe fragments of Count Leo Tolstoy's short story "How Much Land Does A Man Need?" and the disguised inevitable end. Pearl S. Buck's "The Good Earth" is a riveting read,a book that borrows its classic proportions from the well-drawn characters,ranging from the honest Lung to the selfless O-Lan,the cunning whore Lotus to the deceiving first Lung son,perfectly coalesced into a social setting that is forever promising to be on the shift.+books
What a real Eunuch has to say.+N+I have not read this book but I am a real life Eunuch. I had my testicles surgically removed. In an Interview on Salon.com the author says "Castration does not get rid of the sexual drive, get rid of erections or any amount of sexual activity." WRONG!!!  How would he know any way? He is NOT a Eunuch. He has had a vasectomy but that is totally different. I can speak from experience; when a man becomes a eunuch his sex drive drops to absolute zero. I had a very strong sex drive prior to castration but it is now completely gone. The only way for a Eunuch to regain his sex drive is to take some form of testosterone replacement. I have never heard of any real life Eunuch who was not on testosterone replacement therapy that had a sex drive. Don't waste your time on this book; the author obviously didn't do enough, if any research. If you want to learn about Eunuchs then search the web. There are a lot of us out there, and our numbers are growing+books
Peter Smith hardcover WARNING!!!+N+If you're considering buying the Peter Smith "edition" of this book, note that it is NOT a new "edition" in hardcover but the Vintage International edition rebound in red cloth, with the cover of said trade paperback glued onto the front. It looks like it's been rebound for libraries, is the type of thing that's usually not for sale to the general public (. . .) The book is WELL-REBOUND, and may still be worth it to you Cormac McCarthy diehards out there -- it is for me, and ultimately I'm just gonna keep the copy of it I bought, but it's still quite disappointing. Thought you deserved a warning, hope it came in time. McCarthy's a great writer, of course -- feel a little guilty about the one-star, but it's an issue of the edition, not the book+books
The Seminal Book on Chicago's Lost Architechture+P+First issued in 1975, this book captures the magnitude and the magnificence of Chicago's architecture that has been destroyed (by nature and man).  Today Chicago is widely regarded as an architectural jewel (and it is, I live there!) but after reading this book you won't be able to stop imagining how much more amazing the city might be if the Urban Renewal movement of the 1960s and early 1970s had never happened.  If you are interested in architecture, Chicago history or urban design and planning, read this book+books
You will laugh out loud+P+I laughed out loud while I read this book. I was surprised that it is so slim, yet each story is packed with humor. The reader cannot help but enjoy the Professor's adventures in the crazy academic world of Philology. This is a great book to take with you if you will only have the chance to read in short sips or if you only have time for one more story before bed- just make sure you close the windows so the neighbors don't complain about the laughter+books
Merits Zero Stars+N+For the shear audacity of disobeying scripture this book and its entire series receives no stars. I cringe whenever I see God's word taken out of context, changed, perverted, detracted from, or added onto, especially by men who are supposed to know better. In God's word He clearly gives His opinion on fictionalizing His holy book:  Revelation 22:18-19 "For I testify to everyone wo hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds to these things, God will add to him the plagues that are written in this book; and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from Book of Life, from the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book."  Proverbs 3):5-6 "Every word of God is pure; He is a shield to those who put their trust in Him. Do not add to His words, Lest He rebuke you, and you be found a liar."  One way to be found a liar and receive God's rebuke is by fictionalizing (a dangerous form of adding onto God's word where He has not made us privy to His details and outcome of events) His words and prophecies. Fictionalizing the very last days before the Lord's return not wise, and reading the words of authors who do this just might be damaging to one's understanding of scripture and truth in that it can easily confuse the reader concerning true bible facts--especially those who do not have an understanding of scripture or who have never read it. The authors of this series are treading on thin ice, simply shown by God's own words of warning in His book.  The authors have taken serious license in adding onto God's words in their Left Behind series, creating doctrines that do not exist in the bible and that do not align with the teachings of scripture. There are dangerous views on abortion presented in the series, even among its "Christian" characters, which can confuse those who have a liberal mindset or who might not fully understand where God stands on these issues in His unchanging word. There are false representations of the Mark of the Beast that cannot be backed up by scripture but that are debunked by what scripture does say about it. The books also have a huge misrepresentation of the AntiChrist. He is portrayed nothing like scripture has indicated such a ruler will be.  At best, this is a disobedient human attempt at trying to add more detail and story to a time in history Jesus said would be the worst ever. The authors have gone far beyond author's license. We just are not allowed to do this with the word of God.  I urge Christians to read and reread their bibles and be blessed as the Lord promised you would be for reading the book of Revelation. "Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written in it; for the time is near." Revelation 1:3  He has told us what He wants us to know. We don't have the liberty to add onto it or change it+books

Engaging text, beautiful artwork+P+The romantic days of the search for the "missing link" are gone, and as science writer Carl Zimmer reminds us, that is all to the good since the very idea of a "missing link" is a misdirection.  What we have today is the search for human ancestors and for a distinction to be made between our ancestors and other ancient hominids.  This book with its beautiful prints and photos, engaging drawings and helpful charts, and especially the sprightly text by Zimmer brings the general reader up to date (circa 2005) on the latest developments.  There's a lot going on.  There's the controversy about Homo floresiensis, thought to be a tiny hominid, found in Indonesia in 2004.  Zimmer presents the arguments.  Some think that Homo floresiensis is an island adaptation of Home erectus, the first hominid to make it out of Africa 1.8 million years ago.  After all, island adaptation often leads to diminished size.  There are fossils of now extinct small elephants in Indonesia.  But others believe that the skull found is an anomaly, a case of microcephaly, a birth defect.  I'm betting on the latter.  There are wooden spears found that are around 400,000 years old, meaning that Homo habilis or Homo ergaster (who may be one and the same) or the more recently discovered Homo heidelbergensis were accomplished tool makers long before Homo sapiens arrived on the scene.  There is the idea that Homo neanderthalensis is a cold climate, European adaptation of Homo erectus.    Part of the excitement in paleontology is in the new fossil finds, and part is in our new-found ability to analyze DNA samples to map the spread of Homo sapiens.  This allows us to see the "out of Africa" phenomenon in three main stages: (1) Homo erectus leaving Africa 1.8 million years ago, followed by (2) Homo heidelbergensis expanding into not only Europe and the Near East and China, but into Southeast Asia as well.  Finally (3), about 130,000 years ago, Homo sapiens begin to move out of Africa, first into the Levant and then into East Asia and Australia (50,000 years ago), then into Europe and Siberia (40,000 years ago) and ultimately into the Americas (20,000 years ago).  Incidentally, this book has Homo sapiens coming onto the scene almost 200,000 years ago.  Zimmer talks about the various hominid cultures and speculates on their social and religious possibilities.  On the subject of what happened to the Neanderthal, he intimates that he believes it was a combination of things that allowed humans to survive while the Neanderthals went extinct, including being better able to adapt to climate change, having a more sophisticated culture and better hunting techniques.  I think it's also possible (actually I think it's likely) that humans were better at killing not only herd animals but the competition as well, meaning that one of the reasons that the Neanderthals are gone is because we killed them.  Zimmer more or less skirts around this, waiting (wisely, I think) until further evidence is in.  In a final chapter, "Where Do We Go from Here?" Zimmer briefly discusses biotechnology and genetic engineering, and how our species might be affected by cultural evolution.  This is a handsome book  It's like a coffee table book with the high gloss, heavy pages and the beautiful artwork, but smaller in size.  Most significantly it is a book aimed at the general reader that is well written, well edited, and very well presented.  And it is clear.  It is in fact the clearest book on human origins--usually a very murky subject--that I have read.  By the way, Zimmer is the author of several excellent science books.  I especially recommend his creepy, but fascinating, Parasite Rex: Inside the Bizarre World of Nature's Most Dangerous Creatures (2000)+books
I think Ms. Hazzard owes me an apology.+N+The only reason I finished "The Transit of Venus" was the hope of any improvement.  This book took away two hours of my life-two hours that I can never earn back by reading true literature.  The story (is there a story?) is dreadful.  The sentence structures, the paragraph performances, the offered descriptions assist in one wondering if Ms. Hazzard is merely attempting to impress the audience with her self-perceived insights.  I will never recommend this book to any audience.  Ms. Hazzard and her publisher should refund my money+books
Good story / bad characters+N+The story is great, and even educational. Asimov's science and visual settings are excellent and, well, fantastic. But the characters were painfully cliche. Perhaps they weren't when the book was written, but they certainly are now.  You have your main character: A tall, strong, and dashingly handsome take-charge guy of infinite courage.  And your sidekick (pretty much): A beautiful, young, intelligent woman who wants only to be respected for her intellect and not her perfect body and flowing hair.  The dialogue between these characters is ludicrous at best, and takes up a depressingly large amount of the novel. Y'know - Him constantly hitting on her in a rather pushy way, and her constantly deflecting his come-ons with a secret physical attraction for him. And yes, his heroic strength saves her more than once. And, of course, they get together in the end.  I respect Asimov tremendously, but this book was like Lucas' Episode III: A great story with a horrendous script and characters. And also like Episode III, I finished it trying to convince myself that I liked it, but was pretty much just annoyed that I gave it the time that I did+books
Mostly useless+N+I found the book very difficult to use and almost never had what I was looking for.  The small dictionary in the back of my eyewitness travel guide was much more useful+books
Cheap Rip-off Of Elmore Leonard+N+Dave Barry's novel is a quick read, but there's nothing fresh about the story or the characters.  The story centers on many different characters that become involved in a potential airport disaster--a columnist, his son, a rich, sleazy lawyer, a wannabe criminal, etc.  Like Elmore Leonard's books, the characters begin to collide in unpredictable ways.  But the pay-off is just not that great.  You may find yourself thinking "What's the point?" after finishing the novel.  This book was made into a pretty forgettable movie that featured a great cast (Tim Allen, Rene Russo, Stanley Tucci, Tom Sizemore, etc.)+books
Very Helpful, Encouraging, and Informative!!!+P+This is an excellent resource for women with Endo and for those who love them. I was encouraged by reading other women's stories to remind me that I am not alone. My husband has also learned a lot from the book and has become more sympathetic. It is a relatively easy read and is the best Endo book that I have found. The book also has a sense of humor which is essential for anyone with Endo. My only wish is that the book would have gone more in depth concerning alternative methods for treatment. Overall, an awesome resource+books
Perfect for the Classroom!+P+I used &quot;News Reporting and Writing&quot; when I studied journalism in college. Upon returning to the college classroom to teach journalism, I introduced my students to the latest edition of this wonderful text. The book provides an excellent introduction to the various elements of good journalism and is perfect for a beginning or advanced course on reporting and writing. I recommend it highly+books
Not a translation.+N+I started reading this book, skipping the introduction and then realized this isn't the Tao Te Ching at all. This is just what some guy wishes the tao te ching said, and so he wrote his own version. It turns out the author admits this in the introduction. I wish I had known that bit of information before purchasing this piece of junk. I guess I should have taken the hint with the "A New Version" doublespeak on the front cover. Sigh. I usually give away old books to friends and relatives but this one is going straight in the trash where it belongs.     +books
Take a deep breath and connect the dots+P+Prepare to start hyperventilating as you read this book if you have only been exposed to the "official" version of 9/11. Read it, and you may never again be able to stomach the words "War on Terror." Without throwing bricks, without partisan pot-shots, Dr. Griffin methodically lays out evidence which overwhelmingly suggests U.S. government complicity in the 9/11 attacks. Yet, to his credit, all the author asks for is a genuine, in-depth, and independent investigation. (The 9/11 Commission provided nothing of the sort, but that's the topic of his next book, "The 9/11 Commission Report: Omissions and Distortions")   Part of what makes "The New Pearl Harbor" compelling is that it cites so many reports from mainstream media--Newsweek, the Washington Post, the New York Times, etc. Quotes from these "reliable" sources appear in copious endnotes that together create a pattern. Major media just hasn't connected the dots. (This, perhaps, is because its owned by people and corporations who profit handsomely from war.)  But in crime-busting 101, we learn to suspect those who benefit most from a crime. Could our government be so monstrous as to sacrifice 3,000 of its own citizens to secure hundreds of billions of dollars in war funding for many years to come? Our military trains leaders to think in terms of "cost benefit." Securing a New American Century of "full-spectrum domination," to them, may be the prize that justifies such an atrocity. These and many other questions beg serious probing, not knee-jerk ridicule and dismissive labels like "unpatriotic." Read this book, pass it on, and demand that Congress start answering questions; many of the official aspects of 9/11 simply don't add up+books
a shameful posthumous misrepresentation of McL.'s thought.+N+I'm surprised this travesty is still in print.  &quot;Not in McLuhan's style&quot; is a kind understatement; Powers demonstrates flagrant misunderstanding and confusion of basic McLuhanesque ideas.  Try 'Laws of  Media' or 'Understanding Electric Language' instead+books
Elizabeth George in Shorts+P+Elizabeth George in Shorts is just as suspensful and whimsical as she is doing the long novel.  Normally, I don't read short stories but decided to do so after finishing all of the Inspector Lynley books.  I definitely was not disappointed.  This lady comes with a great sense of humour in addition to her other sterling literary attributes. All the stories were suspensful right up to the final unexpected endings.  I, Richard, the last of the stories, transforms history into modern day life.  Both sad and amusing+books
The first, but certainly not last Heinlen.+P+Prior to owning this book, I had never heard of Robert A. Heinlein.  I must say (sounding perverted, unfortunately) the only thing that really drew me to this book was the cover.  Upon realization later, it looked somewhat similar to the statue "Venus deMilo." As I read the book from the start, it really captivated me how detailed everthing seemed for a futuristic civilization.  It almost seemed as if RAH, himself, had been there and wanted to share with the world, everything that he had seen. Though, mentioned in other reviews, the strong incestuous vibe the book pulls in later chapters is a slight bit of a turnoff, I feel it also adds to the story somehow.  Almost as if it ties into his other books from certain pivotal points.  If some of the actions had not happened, the series and heritage would not have been what it was.  I do mention this as the first Heinlein book I had ever read, so I may have mixed it up somehow. Even so, I daresay, this is a spectacular read, and should not be overlooked.  That, and read the other works he has out. Disappointed?  I think not+books
AMATEURISH+N+Although the author clearly loves his subject, he is not a good writer. There are awkwardly worded sentences, misspellings, wrong names and dates, and clichï¿½ after cliche. This is basically a rehash of the George Eells' chapter that came out decades ago and offers little new information. The photographs are crudely reproduced and look like seventh generation photocopies. Yes, the book is inexpensive, but it looks, feels, and reads like it. This must be a self-published book. The writer clearly needed an editor and a better printer. There's a better book out there+books
Best on Personal Finance in plain English+P+This is the best Personal Finance book written in plain English that I have read.  I will be buying one for each of my grown children.  They aren't listening to me about saving "for a rainy day" so I hope that equipped with the information in this book, they will get the full picture.  (and it won't be from Mom)+books
THIDWICK THE BIG-HEARTED MOOSE+P+By far, Dr. Suess' best.  Too bad this book is not acknowledged and advertised as his other silly books are. By far the best for the simple moral message a child can understand for years.  +books
Thayer is No Longer Relevant. But...+N+Thayer went great lengths to produce an excellent lexical resource. Many would agree. But shortly after publishing, his book became outdated. Koine Greek was no longer viewed as a Holy Spirit invention (which was thought for a long time since scholars could not find 10% of the NT vocabulary in secular writings until about the last century). Since Thayer's release, Koine lexicography has taken great strides and has since left this dictionary far behind (see "Greek Grammar Beyond the Basics" by Daniel B. Wallace).  One positive of Thayer's dictionary is his study of etymology. Understanding how words form is very helpful in vocabulary memorization. But I'll add a word of caution illustrated by this short etymology lesson: "Butterfly" does not mean "a fly made of butter."  As words evolve (or devolve), they do not always retain their meanings. Koine vocabulary is an example that has been required to simplify in order to be accepted by various cultures. The words will not always fit etymological patterns or classical definitions.  Why then is Thayer's still so popular? It's cheap. It's public domain. And it's easy to use. Purchase at your own risk.  Recommended: "A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature" by Walter Bauer, Frederick William Danker (Editor+books
A very self righteous look at the F&amp;I War+N+The author clearly has done his research and &quot;digging&quot; when it comes to the facts. Then how come he is so bitter? Jennings spends too much time not only disputing almost every other book about the French and Indian  War, but also &quot;wrestling to the ground&quot; any thesis in opposition  to his own! He comes off sounding bitter, cranky and unattractive. His  glosses over the military aspects of the war as if these details are  beneath the serious historian--why? It was a war after all! It is not a bad  reference book but as far as read-don't bother+books
Unbiblical and bad writing make for one star+N+This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck+books
Great, but unconventional Batman book...+P+"Forensic Files of Batman" truly is an entertaining read.  People often forget about Batman's intelligence, overfocusing on the action elements of the Dark Knight genre.  While some readers and reviewers are nitpicking on little details (e.g. Commissioner Gordon still working, no mention of Robin, etc.), this book is meant for all, not just diehard fans.  If you like good detective short stories or are a general Batman fan, this book is for you. +books
Great stuff, low value+N+Overall the book (if you can call it that) does offer what its supposed to and does that in an effective manner. It teaches you how to develop persuasion. The trouble though is it only gives you the most basic outline on just 11 pages. The information that is contained inside of it is something that has been available for years in other similiar books+books
HATE FICTION+N+Clearly the tens of millions of fouls who read this racist [...] fail to see it for exactly what is; an endorsement of Ethnic cleansing. If the tables were turned and a Jew, or a Muslim wrote a series in which anyone who disagreed with Judaism, or Islam was BRUTALLY MURDERED than the same fundamentalists idiots who take such disgusting pleasure out of this garbage would go simply ape s**t. I do not know what is more pathetic the fact that there are actually fundamentalist Lunatics out there who write this truly unforgivable racist garbage, or the large number of dimwits out who eagerly wait to throw their money away on each installment of HATEFUL FILTH!!+books
desperate housewives prequel+N+I thought this was one of the worst books I ever attempted to read.  The whole plot is just plain ridiculous.  Bored middle-aged housewife meets drifting artist and in the space of four days they fall madly in love with a passion that lasts a lifetime.  When the kiddies find out they think it is noble that mom cheated on dad and pined away all those years.  Such rubbish--don't people see how contrived and unrealistic, not to mention immoral, this is?  Avoid this one+books
View in the dark+P+Whoever cares about Iran or Persia can get something from this book. It's not much of a &quot;journey&quot; in the sense of a travelog, but the conversations and the few glimpsed scenes are worth the price. The author  also provides lots of interesting, scholarly background, for example,  on  why Iranians feel so unlucky, and why the CIA is a sinkhole for good ideas.  Maybe the saddest moment in the book was the brief chat the author had with  an older Iranian, who practically begged to have US should bomb the  mollahs. It's sad, not because the mollahs are human beings and should live  in peace, but because the thought of the US doing something to rescue  people is so old-fashioned+books
An eye opener+P+This book was a real eye opener. After reading this book I am much more knowledgable about the foods available in the market and I am able to make better and healthier choices. My overall health has improved and I feel I have more energy than before. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone+books
Koontz continues to churn out hits+P+Year after year I wonder how Koontz can continue to keep his writing fresh and entertaining.  I worry that he will become like many other authors and become predictable and boring.  Happily- this has NOT happened to Koontz.  His last several books have only gotten better for me, I have a hard time putting them down!  Life Expectancy starts off with a very interesting premise: Jimmy Tock's grandfather made a prediction on his deathbed the same day Jimmy was born, listing 5 terrible days in Jimmys future.  Thus, the book begins and we are along for the ride to see what each of these 5 days hold in store for him and his family.  Because the characters in this book are so enjoyable and loveable (as most of Koontz's characters are!) I found myself in anticipation really hoping that these days wouldn't destroy them...  Other stand out features of this book:  Not predictable at all- from start to finish.  The ending was especially great in proving this point, as well as just great in general!  It was pretty fast-paced and kept the pages turning and did not leave me bored for a chapter.  The uniqueness of the story as well as the quirkiness.  Lastly, to reiterate, the characters!!  Koontz really goes above and beyond most authors I read (and I read A LOT) in creating not only fun, unique and loveable characters- but they are also very memorable!  It's not often I can remember characters from a book in much detail, but Koontz has such a gift that I can recall many, many of his characters and always find myself sad when their story ends.  I think that is the sign of an exceptional writer+books
Love the stories behind the recipes+P+I bought this book more for the stories than the recipes.  I was pleased with both, but the stories are my favorite.  I tried one of the recipes and it was excellent. +books
Good basic information, outdated training techniques+N+This book has a lot of useful information about puppy development and personality - but it recommends the choke-chain leash-correction training approach, which has been abandoned by many dog trainers. Setting up situations so the puppy gets it right and is then rewarded is much more humane than jerking the poor little one around+books
Loved it!+P+This book was very tender and I would reccomend it to anyone who really loves to feel+books
Not a happy buyer+N+I've made 2 of the recipes so far and am reluctant to try more. If I had known what I now know BEFORE I bought the book, I'd never have bought it.   The first recipe was a complete bomb: the Tofu and Vegetable Curry, p. 105. I found it too hot and also bitter. Thin, watery gravy; very hot; and a nasty, bitter taste -- yuck! I love curries, but this was by far the worst I've ever tasted. I'll never make it again!  The Butternut Squash Soup, p. 98, was a little better. I liked it, but my husband didn't and wouldn't eat it (complained of a sour-milk taste). The soy milk and perhaps also the margarine had curdled over the long hours of cooking. And since cut-up squash isn't available in my town, the recipe took an hour of hard work, mostly to dismember a fresh butternut squash. I'll make this again when I can find cut-up squash, but I'll leave out the soy milk and margarine during the slow cooking. When the slow cooking is done, I'll puree the soup, then add the soy milk and margarine, and reheat gently on the stovetop. I think this will avoid the curdling and yield a creamier product.  My recommendation to others: don't waste your money on this clunker+books
Awesome Book - pick it up+P+This is one of my favorite books on entertaining.  I love all of Martha's stuff and this one is one of my favorites.  Anyone considering entertaining on any scale should pick this up and read it!+books
Shallow+N+"The Denial of Death" is evasive and lacking in depth, not to mention excessively wordy.  It could be seen, for instance, that death is a philosophical uncertainty.  The denial of the absolute uncertainty of death (and uncertainty in general) could thus be a more profound form of denial.  It could also be seen that a human being is as dead before his conception as after his death, and his prior state of death did not prevent him from emerging into life.  Death is then life-giving.  Further, a living being is made of 'dead' matter - atoms as dead as those which make up rocks.  Where, then, does life begin and death end, and vice versa?  Is there ultimately a difference between death and life?  In the end, this central notion lacks imagination (at least you could credit Freud with that), and has not been thoughtfully analysed, only assumed.  By contrast, "The Human Evasion" is an unblinking analysis of the human condition and our psychological defenses against it. (Note: this book is out of print, but can be found online at http://www.theabsolute.net/minefield/humevas.html+books
Concise and nearly complete +P+Steven Stavropoulos has chosen some of the most well known quotes of the ancient Greeks for this book, and some which are more difficult to find.  This is an excellent reference book for anyone who would like to quickly look up a quote on "love", "virtue", "justice", etc. I can see where his translation is slightly diffent from others that I have read, but the message is still transmitted very accurately.  This is a must own for anyone who enjoys reading about Greek philosophy, theater or culture+books
If only Campbell were the author...+N+There's not much to say.  The book isn't confusing because the material is too technical--it's often confusing because the author doesn't go in enough depth; it's frustrating when a crucial concept is presented, such as Hamilton's Law, but no examples on its applications are put forth.  I find myself frequently searching the internet to suppliment this textbook.  It also doesn't help that the book doesn't come with a cd-rom, or any additional material, unless you purchase the teacher's edition...reading this textbook makes me yearn for Campbell.  +books
Hillariously Nonsensical Plagiarism+N+The worst book ever written about the Middle East is probably Joan Peters' From Time Immemorial; in this book Alan Dershowitz not only attempts to usurp that dubious honor from Peters, he also heavily plagiarizes half her book in order to do so.  The man who has made a career and a fortune as a lawyer mastering the art of defending and exonerating the guilty turns his gaze onto one of the international community's leading delinquents and most prolific violators of International Human Rights Law, International Humanitarian Law and UN Resolutions.  His defending of nation states, however, is as unconvincing as his knowledge of historical events is laughable.  Joan Peters' book was completely demolished and shown to be a fraud by Norman Finkelstein, and even the most ardent of Zionists have openly admitted the book is worthless.  20 years after that book faded into oblivion, Alan Dershowitz plagiarized much of its nonsensical arguments to masquerade as a book of his own.  For a full documentation of this plagiarism, see Norman Finkelstein's personal website.  By writing this book, Dershowitz has inflicted more damage on Israel than a thousand books criticizing it ever could.  Any neutral who would read this book would realize how shoddy The Case for Israel really is; both the book and the `case' that Dershowitz presents are nothing more than a pathetic assortment of lies, bigoted arguments, idiocies, misrepresentations and highly elaborate intellectual scams.+books
Great service.+P+The book arrived very quickly and was in pristine condition.  GREAT service+books
An all-inclusive encyclopedia of the Academy Awards +P+This book is not a history in the since of most history books. It does not detail how the academy began, or how it changed over the years, or give you any kind of insider view of its workings. Instead, it is a complete listing of every nominee and every winner in every category since the award ceremony's inception in 1927. There are plenty of photographs of the nominees and images  of scenes from the nominated films for each year, so it is not dry in the way many reference books are. In fact, Mr. Osborne's love of film and its history really shine through in the book. It is interesting to look through this book and see what we consider to be films that have withstood the test of time versus which ones were rewarded by the academy at the time. For example, in 1939, the Academy did recognize that "Gone with the Wind" was the best picture of the year, which people were lining up to watch in movie theaters until its television broadcast premiere in 1976. However, in 1941, "How Green was My Valley" won best picture, which is a film that hardly anyone watches anymore, while "Citizen Kane" was completely ignored. It's also interesting to see how the Academy compensated for past oversights by awarding performances that were less than stellar in subsequent years. For instance, in 1934 Bette Davis was overlooked in her performance in "Of Human Bondage". This caused a huge public outcry. The following year the Academy gave her the best actress award for her performance in "Dangerous"- a move that has largely been seen over the years as a consolation prize for what happened the year before. This book is full of little insights such as these, and it is a fun book that gives hours of entertainment for film history buffs. I bought my first copy of this history by Mr. Osborne back in 1987 when he was then detailing the 60 years of the Oscar, and I enjoyed it so much I have been updating my copy every time he releases a new edition. Highly recommended+books
A tight, well-researched anecdote of lust desguised as religion+P+I can not laud this book too highly.  It is meticulously researched and intelligently presented.  You will be astounded.  Stunned, maybe.  Did you know that the deadly form of the religion of peace got its start in Boulder, CO?  Can you imagine that the people who were smart enough to bring down the World Trade Center were such superstitious morons that they thought a glucose IV bottle was attracting Soviet bombers?  Well, you will if you read this.  And that's just the start+books
Don't Drink Soy Milk Either!  +N+Frank Oski draws attention to the very real health dangers of commercial dairy products. Unfortunately, he does consumers a grave disservice by encouraging the consumption of soymilk, an alternative that is even riskier. Soymilk was rarely drunk in Asia prior to the 20th century and like other modern, nonfermented soy products has been linked to digestive distress, thyroid damage, cognitive decline, ADD/ADHD, immune system breakdown, infertility, reproductive disorders and even heart disease and cancer. Sadly, many people have seen their health seriously deteriorate because of soy milk. Children are at such risk that in July 2005 the Israeli Health Ministry issued a health advisory warning parents that they should not feed their children soyfoods or soymilk more than once per day or a maximum of three times per week.  For people who would like to explore all sides of the milk controversy, I highly recommend Ron Schmid's "The Untold Story of Milk"+books
The First & Final Word on Food Crticism & Life+P+I give this memoir five stars for the the author's curiousity, acumen and intelligence, all of which inform this wide-ranging tale.    Eating My Words will answer your questions about Mimi Sheraton's adventures as a New York Times food critic, travel writer and magazine editor, as well as stints spent as consultant to venues ranging from the famed Four Seasons restaurant to public schools and hospital kitchens.  Through it all, Sheraton reveals a keen intellect, a dedication to research, and a passion for accuracy.  Her prose is direct rather than lyrical, but the reader will emerge with a better understanding of restaurants and both admiration and appreciation for a woman and writer who has lived her life well.  Especially worthy savoring are Sheraton's love for her husband, Richard Falcone-- their marriage of 49 years gives a happy backdrop to this memoir, and Sheraton's reminiscences of her parents, who imbue her with wit, chutzpah, and lifelong curiousity about all things culinary.  Also welcome are Sheraton's  observations about the workplace: "It's not your job, the employer has rented it to you," she observes, noting that if the job no longer suits you, it is time to quit-- something that Sheraton did several times in her career, including her departure from the New York Times.  My appreciation for Sheraton and this book grew as I progressed through the narrative.  My initial four star appraisal had grown to five my the end of this memoir, chiefly because of my admiration for Sheraton and her well-lived life.  This is a woman who has lived with zest and integrity aned, thankfully, has chosen to share her experiences with us.  We should all be so lucky+books
Crops, Crops and More Crops+N+I had to read Jared Diamond's Pulitzer prize winning book because of the rave reviews and acclaim. The thoughts that he introduces in the book are certainly interesting and he presents us with a new way to interpret history which is certainly important. However, there is much overkill in making points about the development of each civilization - crops are the major topic with little discussion on guns, germs (more than the other 2), and steel. Of course the arguement for this focus is that the domestication of crops is how civilizations develop guns, germs and steel. I enjoyed parts of the book considerably, but you would have to have a strong interest in horticulture and botany to truely appreciate the book. I guess I was spoiled by first reading his sequel to GGS, "Collapse" - a terrific read that should be of interest to everyone -it relates our industrialization to every aspect of the environment and show historically how this has shaped history. It has major rammifications for our situation on this earth right now. -RK+books
another excellant book by Pat+P+Pat uses a lot of history in this book to get his point across,thus if you like history it is quite good, but be warned that if you don't like to read history, you may find yourself skimming through parts of the book where the history is particularly heavy,but he gets his point across.This is not to say this is a history book,but there is a lot of history reading in this book.This book is an excellant example of showing how we have gone too far trying to protect the world+books
Negroponte agrees...+P+"And so? I know: Extrapolating bandwidth, processor speed, network dimensions, or the shrinking size of electromechanical devices has become truly tiresome. Moore's Law, first expounded by Gordon Moore in 1965, is indeed a stroke of brilliance, but one more mention of it should make you puke. Terabit access, petahertz processors, planetary networks, and disk drives on the heads of pins will be ... they'll just be. Face it - the Digital Revolution is over." -- Nicholas Negroponte, 12/98  Maybe this will silence some of the recent critics who've been tearing into this book.  Yes, this stuff was actually INTERESTING at one point, but we've heard too much about it at this point.  I own the book, and enjoy re-reading it occasionally (*very* occasionally) when I have nothing better to do, just to get some perspective on how things looked in 1995.  Seems like a century ago, does it not?  Things change so fast in the digital age that books like this are doomed to obscurity 6 months after they're published.  But in my opinion perspective on the past can be priceless, because knowing where we've been helps us figure out where to go next.+books
Outstanding+P+This book is beautifully written. Even in translation, I was amazed by how gorgeous Pamuk's prose is. Some sentences from this book lingered in my head for days afterward. The main character, Ka, is a poet, and the novel itself seemed very poetic to me, but not at all in a dense or difficult way. Indeed, "Snow" flows so smoothly that I would say it's a fairly easy read.  I wasn't sure if I would like this book at first because I didn't think I was particularly interested in Islam and politics. I discovered that "Snow" is primarily about God, love, beauty, happiness, death, life, and loneliness. While all the action takes place in a tiny Turkish village, the themes are broad, sweeping, vast. This book will not grow dated any time soon, if ever.  +books
Reviews better than it reads +N+An unreadable book.  Bits and pieces stretched out over 800 pages that never add up to a whole.  To use DeLillo's garbage theme: it was like finding litter on a sidewalk.  Each piece once meant something, but who knows what.    I finished it because I had read so many good reviews that I thought there must be something worthy in it.  Sometimes a book is torture and then everything comes together at the end.  Not in this case.  Torture for 800 pages and then poof! DeLillo tidies everything up in an epilogue.  Nice scenes and nice sentences and BIG ideas don't necessarily make a book a worthwhile read. It was my first DeLillo book and it will probably be my last+books
Hated it.+N+It seems that people either love it or hate it and  I belong to the latter category.  How did this become a classic???  Having forced myself to read to the end I'm not going to waste anymore time - just read the other 1-star reviews - poor kids forced by their teachers to read this over-rated garbage+books
it works for me+P+I bought this book in August, 2006. At that time, my RA symptoms had me walking with a cane and unable to do any exercise other than very gentle water calisthenics. Fast forward 3 months, and I feel better than I did before I got sick. I now work out on an elliptical trainer, practice yoga, or take a Pilates class 6 days a week. Neighbors who hardly know me comment on the improvement in my mobility (I guess a 30 yo woman with a cane is pretty noticeable.) I've also lost 22 pounds.   I know what the Arthritis Foundation and the rheumatologists say about RA and nutrition and I don't believe them anymore. I can't promise it will work for everyone, but if you have RA, please at least try the guidelines in this book. You owe it to yourself to do whatever it takes to get better.  Only four stars because the text could be better organized+books
Total Garbage+N+Wow. I wish there was a way to give this steaming heap a rating of NO stars. O'Reilly is good at what he does and he should stick to it. Fiction is clearly not his strong suit. His characters were cardboard cutouts, his dialogue stilted and ludicris, his situations cliched and riddled with stereotypes, and his schizophrenic writing veers betweeen pompous moralizing and salacious hyperventilation. Reading it made me wonder just how sharp this guy's mind really is. If this trash is any indication of O'Reilly's true worldview, he's a sick, sad man indeed+books
Read Books Written by Sitting Supreme Court Justices+P+I think that it is good to read widely and get divergent perspectives.  Thus, Christians and Jews should read the Quran and Muslims should read the Torah and the New Testament.  Conservatives should read the Nation or the New Republic and visit the DailyKos website and liberals should read the Weekly Standard or National Review and visit RealClearPolitics.  The same perspective applies with Breyer's book.  Regardless of your perspective, you should read this brief and easily understandable statement of judicial philosophy from a sitting Supreme Court justice.  (And, it would also be good to read the earlier counterpoint from Justice Scalia for the same reasons.)  Breyer's book is a slightly revised and edited version of lectures he's delivered over the past few years.  It is therefore a mix of the spoken and written word which has advantages and disadvantages.  There's an easy informality conveyed from the "spoken" parts of the text that make the book almost conversational.  At the same time, there is the disorganization and carelessness that results from spoken delivery.  Thus, sometimes the text is clear and orderly, the way written text often is, and other times it is a bit confusing and meandering the way text from speech often is.  If you want to study the book like a student, this style can get in your way and it also opens the book to criticism that may be correct, but unfair for the format (the mixed combination of written and spoken delivery).  Breyer narrates his perspective on judging with a fairly simple description of his approach and then several examples to expand, elaborate, and demonstrate this perspective.  He argues that this perspective ("active liberty") is useful in understanding Constitutional law and that it should be employed widely by other judges.  He also directly compares his method to the "literalist" approach outlined by Justice Scalia.  While most of the narrative is written at a level the Common Reader can grasp, the details of Breyer's perspective and the examples he provides appear to me to require a deeper knowledge of Constitutional law for true appreciation.   I would strongly recommend that anyone with any remote interest in our Constitution and the Supreme Court should read this book (and the counterpoint from Scalia).  It is brief, readable, straightforward, and highly accessible to the Common Reader.  On a more negatively critical note of the perspective Breyer describes, I have to express my surprise at the inherent danger in the approach.  Breyer recommends that judges try to understand the purpose and consequence of the law in question and use an interpretation of purpose and consequence that relies upon the "active liberty" conceptualization.  (Briefly, active liberty describes the actions of good citizenship.  Breyer believes that the Constitution is designed in part to encourage people to be good democratic citizens and that it is good to interpret law from this view.)  Breyer takes the notion of active liberty from a prior source, Benjamin Constant and his essay, "The Liberty of Ancients Compared with that of Moderns," (available for free online if you do a search).  Thus, Breyer is clearly and directly arguing that judges should go beyond the text of the law (and all the information in the controversy) and use an active meaning-making process to figure out what's really going on.  The most obvious danger to this approach is the variation in meaning-making of different people.  Would a liberal-minded person really want a judge like Jesse Helms to use his personal meaning-making process; likewise would a conservative want a judge like Ted Kennedy to use his personal meaning-making process?  Breyer seems to dismiss the obvious psychological variation that has to exist in different judges and assumes that each one can somehow correctly divine the true meaning of "active liberty" and then properly apply it in interpreting law.  The dangers and risk to this assumption seem transparent to me but not to Justice Breyer.  Maybe they teach that at Harvard Law and, alas, I've only visited that beautiful campus.  My background as a graduate professor in persuasion and attitudes, an observer of myself and others, and my religious beliefs would strongly argue that people always want to justify themselves, their beliefs, and their actions.  Justice Breyer's argument that people can overcome their psychology with his approach is not foolish or careless or impertinent; it is to my education, training, and experience, wrong.  Perhaps the best evidence of this is to first read Breyer's take on the meaning of "active liberty" as he perceives it from Constant's essay and then second read Constant's essay for yourself and see how you understand what Constant meant about "active liberty."  My problem is that I've read Constant's essay and Justice Breyer's take on "active liberty" swerves more than just a little bit from what Constant writes.  In particular note in your reading of Constant's brief essay these statements:  "It follows from what I have just indicated that we can no longer enjoy the liberty of the ancients, which consisted in an active and constant participation in collective power. Our freedom must consist of peaceful enjoyment and private independence."  "Similarly, the people who, in order to enjoy the liberty which suits them, resort to the representative system, must exercise an active and constant surveillance over their representatives, and reserve for themselves, at times which should not be separated by too lengthy intervals, the right to discard them if they betray their trust, and to revoke the powers which they might have abused."  "The danger of modern liberty is that, absorbed in the enjoyment of our private independence, and in the pursuit of our particular interests, we should surrender our right to share in political power too easily.    . . . let us ask the authorities to keep within their limits."  Justice Breyer could have easily avoided this line of criticism by simply saying he wants to take an old concept, active liberty, and give it new meaning.  He could acknowledge Constant and then develop "active liberty" to mean what he wants it to mean.  He would thus avoids any complaints about inconsistent reading of an old text and any potential finger-pointing about intellectual theft.  But, he didn't do that because he thinks his interpretation of Constant's essay is correct.  He knows how to correctly make meaning.  And he does that when he judges Constitutional law, too. +books
A resource for true students of Tolkien+P+The variety of material available in 'The War of the Jewels' is what makes this volume of the History of Middle-earth series one of the best.  Two things stand out.  First is the extensive writings on Hurin after his release from Angband.  In an extension and more fully recounted version of his tale, Hurin's character and the consequences of his release are more fully explored, giving greater depth to the account given in 'The Silmarillion'.  The other is the essay 'Quendi and Eldar'.  This is a treasure-trove not only for the Tolkien linguist but anyone interested in the history of the Elves.  Through an examination of the different words used by the Elves to refer to themselves and their different divisions, the look at their history as they themselves saw it is priceless.  Other parts of the essay and accompanying material fill out references found in 'Unfinished Tales', etc.  'The War of the Jewels' has many stories worth reading on their own that are great examples of the depth and the layers of the legendarium+books
Clear headed and practical+P+This is a very informative book that clears up lots of misconceptions. It explains why the &quot;wellfare state&quot; is still around, even after so many death notices. The analysis shows that there is no net negative cost for comprehensive and universal social programs, and that there are often significant benefits. For those who can read this book without ideological and political blinders, there is much to learn from Peter Lindert's book+books
Excellent tale of early 20th century Jewish immigrant life+P+My hope was to read a novel that gave an accurate and detailed account of the world my grandparents lived in and I was not disappointed. As with the best historical fiction, I was able to gain a sense of not just the environment and setting, but its effect on the main characters, especially David, the main protagonist.   While the prose is often challenging and innovative, the book is a surprisingly easy and quick read that I could not put down. While I was often frustrated by David's inner dialogue, the author must be commended for attempting to convey the inner workings of a child's mind, how his thought process often chaotically bounced around from one thought to another. The author also uses language in a very unique and interesting fashion, namely the contrast between early 20th century New York slang, composed of so many different ethnic groups, to the authors "translation" of Eastern European Yiddish.   For anyone currently reading the novel, who might feel frustrated at a seeming lack of direction in the plot, my advice is to keep reading, as its themes of alienation, growing self-awareness, family, sexual awakening and assimilation become more apparent as the story progresses. And for those who have yet to read the book, I strongly recommend not reading the introduction until after you've finished the book, as it pretty much gives away almost everything that happens in the story and really should have been the Afterword. Regardless, it happens to be a well-written analysis of the novel and can even help the reader in his or her own thoughts and opinions of what is most definitely a classic of 20th century literature.+books
SIZE MATTERS, and so does CENSORSHIP!+P+Now THIS is how the art of Tom of Finland SHOULD be represented...in a volume large enough for us to appreciate the great detail in his work.  UNFORTUNATELY, the people at TASCHEN and the Tom of Finland Foundation found it necessary to re-release this wonderful volume in a SMALLER, cheaper version, and that trend has only gotten worse with the recent release of Tom's "COMIC COLLECTION" - which I reviewed negatively only to see that entire title WITHDRAWN from Amazon in less that 24 hours after my review appeared...so to read THAT review, you'll have to click "SEE ALL MY REVIEWS".

This book is very well-written, and informative+P+The "bad" news:  Probably 2/3 - 3/4 of the books out there today related to dating, relationships, and attracting and/or seducing women are GARBAGE.  I'm the author of my own book, "Mode One: Let The Women Know What You're REALLY Thinking," so I often tend to read other books that I feel might have similar messages and/or philosophies to my own.  "M.A.C.K. tactics: The Science of Seduction Meets the Art of Hostage Negotiation" is a very entertaining and informative read.  The book first caught my attention on Page 18, Page 19, and Page 20.  These pages talk about TAKING ACTION, and BUILDING CONFIDENCE.  Self-Confidence is the greatest psychological "aphrodisiac" for seducing women.  Women leave hints and clues about this all of the time.  Page 31 is great advice also.  The whole entire Chapter 5 is worth the price of the book.  Read it ... you won't be disappointed+books
Awesome Book+P+This books is a must have for James Bond Fans. Dileo captures the essence of the James Bond films+books
Before you judge.. get the other's shoes on... +P+Seierstad writes a compelling book about cultural and personal differences.   I actually can read between the lines the efforts of a man who is trying to find his own voice in a system that does not work as we think.  With Seierstad's candid observations, one might feel compelled to shout and scream... but yet any body who does not have the opportunity to stand out and taste criticism will shield from taking actions.   I loved the way the author was able to clearly state facts and jumped into her emotions (and I can only imagine the shock). Most people will fail to recognize the main character's effor to provide for an honorable way of living, help his younger wife to read, and do his best.   When we read the book without judgement, we are able to understand how we differ. I actually think I can understand why this or that happens.. Reconstruction after war is hard, anybody who has had to live and survive a very strict regime builds up character or shuts down. I usually found myslef thinking what would I do as any of the character's personalities emerged... it was fascinating.   I smiled at the young teenager boy... thinking of my brother, then my son..  of my feminist father and how he would try to emancipate his daughters and truly believe the guy is making a difference in HIS culture which might be less shocking than if we took someone from OUR culture to make drastic changes.  The insecurity portraid by the female characters also happens to so many people (mostly woman who chose to stay at home to care for kids for a while) who leave the competitive world to nurture others.   but most importantly, the book is a gift of courage on everyone.. to tell how they see it, and not pretending to live in a perfect world. I admire their courage, from the comfort of my house, with water and electricity, glass windows and no fear that I'll get bombed.   I couldn't put it down...   IF you want a TOTAL SHOCK, READ IT WITH 'EMERGENCY SEX'(and other desperate measures+books
Please avoid this book+N+This book is a mediocre source for preparing for the PMP. It contains too many errors, inaccurate information and it is loaded with irrelevant information for the pmp test. if you do not want to pass the pmp test then read this book+books
Very Disappointed+N+I was particularly interested in one of the two enclosed disks - 1 CD - same title as the book, and 1 DVD - Primal 3D Anatomy. The disks are highlighted on the cover, and described in intriguing detail on the back cover. BUT WAIT - inside the front cover, the last paragraph on another "highlight" it says "The second CD contains a 45-day free trial". The same note appeared on the disk but it was covered by the Notice to consumer. My conclusion was this misleading presentation WAS INTENTIONAL! Can't return it now because the disk seals are broken. The management at Lippincott Williams & Wilkins should be sent up the river in chains+books
Cranford / Knutsford+P+A very quick review.  A beautifully written book filled with the feminine niceties and social customs of provincial early 19th Century life.  A very interesting read to myself as I was born at Cranford Lodge, Knutsford, the true market town in the north of England that Gaskell based her novel on.  A visit to Knutsford itself brings out the flavour of the writing and tours of "Cranford" including Miss Matty's house and the Assembly Rooms at the George can be arranged through the Gaskell Society+books

1300 pages are too many+N+Quigley was a Georgetown professor who was permitted access for two years in the early 1960's to the private archives of the Committee on Foreign Relations, a Rockefeller internationalist organization that compliments the work of the Trilateral Commission and the Royal Institute of International Affairs.    It is difficult to determine what the author is trying to communicate.  There is no continuity to the book; nothing ties together Quigley's version of the past and of the future.  It's like reading about the solar system and finding out that the conclusion of the matter is that the sun will expand and burn everything up.  You are left wondering, what is the point?    We are left with the suggestion that the elite should continue to guide us in the same direction that we are traveling, but avoiding some of the monumental blunders that they have made in the past.  Quigley's version of history consists mostly of unquestioning repetition of propaganda.  Quigley did a superficial job of analyzing history, and he is even worse at sociology.  He touts Inclusive Diversity as our great strength and greatest gift.  Perhaps he should have considered the aphorism, "Divide and conquer."  The West, or any other empire, can only flourish when it concentrates on matters of common concern, not divisivness    Quigley does slightly better with economics and foreign policy, which are more in his area of expertise.  He correctly observes that British and American "victories" in WWI and WWII resulted in the almost total destruction of international law.  Quigley is in favor of the idea of continental blocs replacing national states.  As globalization unfolds, Quigley exposes some of the hypocrisy and bungling, yet  he inexplicably remains committed to the overall plan.  So, what is the point of all of this costly meddling?  Quigley predicts success...and then failure.  "We shall undoubtedly get a Universal Empire in which the U.S. will rule most of Western Civilization.  This will be followed by a period of decay and ultimately by invasions and the total destruction of Western culture."  Couldn't we save ourselves the trouble and just mind our own business?     Minding our own business is a concept based on the idea that the electorate is in control of the government, and that we have a choice.  However, Quigley admits that international financiers influence and control governments.  Quigley says that the internationalists, who prefer to remain in the background, should be known for their "valuable" contributions.  What these contributions amount to is that they want world government, and they intend to cram it down everyone's throats.  As we slouch toward financial, industrial, and government monopoly the author reminds us of some of the casualties.  "As economic enterprises have become larger and more tightly integrated into one another, the freedom, individualism, and initiative traditionally associated with the modern economy have to be sacrificed." Quigley acknowledges that in our future, "In general, there will be a very considerable modification of the areas and objectives of freedom in all societies of the world, with gradual reduction of numerous personal freedoms of the past."  To add to this loss of freedom, Quigley bemoans our loss of a spiritual mooring and suggests a return to the values of Christianity!   His version of Christianity, of course.  Still full of contradictions, Quigley cleaves to relativism rather than absolutes, approximations rather than final answers-not realizing that the adoption of these mindsets are what weakened the appeal of Christianity.  Finally, as we follow our present course, Quigley predicts an age of conflict characterized by class struggle, war, irrationality, and declining progress. Obviously, we're there now.     Rather than attack his sponsors, who are bringing us this New World Order, Quigley vents his frustration on the middle class.  Quigley touts the moral superiority of both the rich and poor, but he asserts that the middle class consists of poorly-informed, neurotic, bourgeois, radical-right Republicans. Worst of all, they have Puritanical attitudes toward sex.   The many internal contradictions in this book indicate a confused mind or a shallow thinker.  The author's history is mostly stale propaganda, spiced up with occasional pro-government cheerleading or tales of government boondoggles.   Maybe if Quigley had broken this monstrosity into several different books, he would have had something coherent to say.  In this book, Quigley's  conclusion is almost totally divorced from the rest of the book.  This effort spanned 20 years, and possibly senility was sneaking up on the author.   +books

Well done!+P+Great! It was about time that the biggest monster of them all was exposed. "Biggest", not simply because of the unprecedented number of deaths that he caused, but because he was so utterly trivial. As Jung Chang/Halliday show, he wasn't ideologically inspired, he had no liking for his own country and its tremendous culture, and he couldn't sustain mature relationships with other human beings. His motivation was apparently selfish, spiteful and capricious, like the school bully who finds himself running the school. He let the Chinese people starve, while pumping resources abroad to pay for military technology or win the approval of Third World tyrants and "liberation movements". Again, great! Because this book may remind us in the West just how foolish many of our bright young people were back then. On the political demos of the Sixties, the Maoists stood out for their brutality and brainlessness, and total lack of any sense of humour. Many of the intellectuals of the time seem to have been either fooled by Maoism, or bought. They did dirt on the values of their own culture while (figuratively or literally) waving the Little Red Book. Most of them have moved on, but this book might just remind them of creepy behaviour that they'd prefer to forget. Finally, two criticisms that have been made of Jung Chang/Halliday by some reviewers. Firstly, the lack of balance. Well, was there anything remotely attractive about Mao or the things that he did? He "reunited China" - yes, but that doesn't mean that without him it would never have happened, in fact some of the political opponents that Mao destroyed along the way might, given the chance, have presided over a far less monstrous regime. Secondly, the journalistic style of the book. True, occasionally it lapses into cliche, but the text remains accessible and easily readable for anyone who wants to know more about Mao. Compare this with Mao's own turgid platitudes, or the incomprehensible screeds of Marxist intellectuals.  Let Mao have the last word. In 1940 he wrote the following, and one might stop to consider how he lived up to this commitment to the Chinese people, and at what cost to them: "It is not hard for one to do a bit of good. What is hard is to do good all one's life and never do anything bad, to act consistently in the interests of the broad masses, the young people and the revolution, and to engage in arduous struggle for decades on end. That is the hardest thing of all!"+books
14c is too much+N+I agree with the reviewers that thought this book a waste of time and money. I see that it is being sold used for 14 cents. I wouldn't pay half that+books
old news+N+this book wasn't that good.. in fact it isn't just good. the topic has been covered before and, to me, it was like i was reading those portions again only drawn out.  there was nothing new to the story or even the way the author told it.  i regret having bought the book and not sure i would recommend it even for someone to check out, free, at a library+books
Great Read+N+This is a very readable mystery with several cute twists.  If you live in or near the central coast of California you will love the way she works in many points of interest.  The story is filled with love of man-woman, mankind and dog.  You'll love it+books
Culture at its best+P+This is an amazing book, practically one of a kind! The information, illustions, and luster of the indigenous African cultures is beautiful to behold. I recommed introducing young children to cultures and peoples as varied as the come to fully portray to them the true beauty of this creation, life. There is nothing so intricate, so inveloping and powerful as life in this form. Pronounciation is given for the tribes names to bring ease of reading, which is, in fact, very enjoyable+books

Find out who she really is and get some false media stories corrected+P+Ronald Kessler has given us a book that is quite pleasant on several levels.  First, it is nice to get to know more about the First Lady.  While all of the wives of the Presidents are admired by Americans, Laura Bush is particularly admired and loved.  She projects a warmth and intelligence that draws admiration and affection.  Kessler gives us just enough about her origins to let us know that the calm and strength we see has been there from her beginnings and what her early life was like.  Her friends recall instances of her calming influence and strength that resonate with what we see in her public appearances.  Second, we get to see the truly loving and mutually supportive marriage of George and Laura.  The stories of how they came together, the struggle to have kids and the birth of the twins, their finding their way in life as part of the Bush clan, and much more is quite engaging.  The picture we get of them as people is quite different than the phony images the media paints of them (i.e. George likes to read).  We also learn a couple things about Laura that we might find a bit surprising (i.e. she is still a "stress smoker").  Third, just as we gain a more real image of their marriage, we also get corrective information about false stories about each of them that were touted so loudly during the election.  The fatal accident that Laura was involved in as a youth, her supposed drug dealing, George's supposed drug use at Camp David, and many more are all cleared up quite specifically.  It is great to get the real story from the people who actually know and go on record rather than the gossip and innuendo put forward by Kitty Kelly and her ilk.  Kessler has given us a book that reads easily, is not overly fussy in detail, and gives us a portrait that we feel good about and comfortable with.  There are several pages of interesting pictures for Laura's life.  We come away feeling comfortable with our admiration for her and realize that she is an even better person than we had suspected.  Good book and one that you should read in order to get a more accurate picture of our First Lady and the President+books
Blowback from our armed invasion of Mexico+N+President Ulysses Grant called the 1846 U.S. invasioin of Mexico, "the most unjust war ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation."  I see whatever piece of the "American Dream" that immigrants (legal or not) get from coming here as a sort of reparations for all the harm our military empire has caused other nations.  Pat Buchanan has said, "if people don't want terrorism, we have to give up our empire."  I think he's right, I'd just add that the same goes for immigration.  To curb the influx of economic refugees, we have to reform NAFTA, end the exploitative behavior of transnationals (many US-based) in the maquilladoras, support Fair Trade, end the dirty work of places like the School of the Americas and figures like "Economic Hit Men," and so forth.  Moreover, Wooldridge and others often speak as if the "Minute Men" are the only civic group working on the issue of immigration.  Thankfully, there are groups like the American Friends Service Committee and Border Links that have a much more intelligent analysis of migration, and far more humane approaches to this complex issue.  As General Smedley Butler said, "war is a racket," and that includes this war on immigrants.  There is a lot of money that is being made from the building of a high-tech fence, aerial drones, motion sensors, videocameras, detention centers, and the other equipment of a police state.  If we let that industry grow because of one scare or another . . . well, we won't recognize this country as the land of the free and the home of the brave.  Rather than Wooldridge's fear and resentment-mongering, I'd recommend the upcoming boook by Free Speech Radio News host, Deepa Fernandes, which is titled, "Targeted: Homeland Security and the Business of Immigration."  We could also learn a lot by listening to the leaders of Mexico's own movements for justice.  There are many books and DVDs available regarding the courageous efforts of the Zapatistas.

A Fantastic, Compelling Read+P+In the interests of full disclosure, I should start by saying that Craig and I shared an editor at MacAdam Cage and he is a good friend.  Several years ago, at the national book expo, Craig and I swapped copies of our books.  I gave him a copy of my book "The Locklear Letters," and he gave me a copy of "The Contortionist's Handbook."  When he called me to meet him for dinner several months later, I felt compelled to pick his book off the bookshelf and read it.  I was amazed.  Rarely have I found a book so compelling that I thought about it all day and felt the need to race home to read some more of it each night.  It is a great achievement.  Original, thought-provoking, chilling. +books
Something old, something used.+N+Two of the short stories in this book, "Running out of Dog" and "Gone down to Corpus" are not new stories.  Running out of Dog is a spelendid example of what we expect from Mr. L. writing about ironies and tragedies of average people.  But, it should have been noted that 40% of this book is not original.    The others are average reads, over before we have any understganding of the characters Mr. Lehane writes so well about.  None of the others are full of tension, irony, comedy, tragedy, and suspense we've all come to expect. They are mediocre stores meant to sell on the author's excellent reputation.  We waited a long time for another Lehane.  This book certainly does not showcase his talents+books
A Guide to the Project Mgmt Body of Knowledge-3rd Ed+N+The book is good in context but I when I got to the center of the book, it split in half.  Now the first half of the book falls out of the binder.  I'm going to have to remove all the pages, punch holes and put them in a binder.  This is a Guide that I will use and reuse frequently.  I'm disappointed that it did not hold up better.  I haven't even finished the class yet and I didn't abuse the book, just opened it to read and highlight certain sections.  Would you consider replacing the book+books
Evocative but Disjointed+N+Frances Mayes, author of Under the Tuscan Sun, did not set out to write a typical travel book with A Year in the World. She wanted to forgo the usual hotel stays and the trekking from one tourist hotspot to the next, and instead aimed to discover, "could I feel at home here? What is home to those around me?"  Renting (mostly luxurious) homes in such places as Fez, Turkey, Italy, Greece, Portugal and Britain, Mayes and her husband set about attempting to truly feel at home in these various locations. While this premise sounds interesting enough, Mayes struggles to convey her experiences to her audience. Her writing seems at times not to wander far from notebook sketches, yet at other moments is full of self-important prose and metaphors so tired I want to pick them up and carry them. And all throughout, she peppers long - and quite unnecessary - quotes from the various books she is reading along with recipes, and descriptions of gardens that go into far too much detail. The result seems disjointed and too clever, and renders the book very difficult to read.  A Year in the World does have some fine moments, such as Mayes' evocative descriptions of local food that reveal her delight at discovering new taste sensations. But mostly I found myself wanting more - such as when she prefers to conjure up imaginative images of historical scenes rather than inform the reader of the often fascinating true history - or I found myself wanting less, as many inclusions in the book seem superfluous. The impression I ended with was not of what it meant to be `at home' in the countries Mayes and her husband visited, but of what is was to have a series of obviously expensive holidays that centered around food, gardens, and literature+books
Offbeat, satirical+P+This book struck me as unique on several levels.  First of all it is a serious, thorough examination of the 21st Century Mafia and stock scams, through the eys of a serial swindler working for the mob.    But what really appealed to me about this book was its writing style, which was unique among the mob books I've read in being offbeat and satirical. It is very unusual to read either a Mob or a business book, and this book falls in both categories, that approaches its subject in that manner.  You practically have to go back to Jimmy Breslin, and his Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight, to find a less reverential view of the mob. The difference is that Breslin was working in fiction and this is a true story.   In business, the only parallel is Michael Lewis' Liar's Poker, which of course delved into an entirely different side of Wall Street+books
Another Prophetic Disappointment+N+In "Epicenter" Joel Rosenberg provides the background information that drives his novels about the Middle East and the end times.  This nonfiction book will grab readers' attention due to its analysis of current events through the lenses of politics and economics.  However, Rosenberg insists that a third lens of biblical prophecy is necessary in order to truly understand what is happening in the Middle East today.  But is Rosenberg's third lens properly focused?  Has he understood Ezekiel's prophecies correctly?  It should first be recognized that Rosenberg's approach to biblical prophecy is nothing new; he follows the general outline of end time events that have been taught for years by dispensational premillennialists.  All the Bible scholars that he relies upon fall within that school of prophetic interpretation.  They include C.I. Scofield, John Walvoord, and Hal Lindsey.  He refers to Tim LaHaye as "arguably the world's preeminent prophecy expert" (p. 288).  During the thirty-seven years since my conversion and the twenty-eight years in which I have pastored an evangelical Christian church, I have studied both the biblical prophecies and the modern-day prophecy teachers.  At the beginning of my Christian life I was convinced that the prophecy teachers had the future figured out, but I have learned over time that they are less than reliable.  For example, Lindsey suggested in "The Late Great Planet Earth" that Christ would return in 1988.  In the first edition of "The Beginning of the End," LaHaye said that World War I was the first sign of the end times, but in the 1991 revision of the book he changed that first sign to the founding of the modern nation of Israel in 1948.  So I approached Rosenberg's book with caution.  "Epicenter" gives the impression that Ezekiel 38 and 39 are easy to understand.  Rosenberg does not mention that evangelical scholars disagree.  Peter Craigie says, "The series of prophecies concerning Gog . . . are among the most difficult parts of the entire book of Ezekiel to interpret."  Even dispensational premillennialists cannot agree on when Ezekiel 38 and 39 are going to be fulfilled.  Will it be before, during, or after the tribulation?  Or will it be after the millennium?  Advocates for each position can be found.  Rosenberg also skips over what Ezekiel 37 meant to Ezekiel's contemporaries.  Since they were living in exile in Babylon when Ezekiel delivered his prophecies, wouldn't they naturally have thought that the divine promise of return to the land referred to them?  But Rosenberg doesn't even mention that possibility.  Instead he takes a hermeneutical leap and immediately applies the prophecy to modern Israel's founding in 1948.  The biggest error comes from Rosenberg's reliance upon a nineteenth century scholar's teaching that in Ezekiel 38:3 "rosh" refers to Russia (pp. 85-86).  Even dispensational premillennialists like Charles Dyer and Ralph Alexander reject that interpretation.  What about "Meshech" and "Tubal"?  In his novels Rosenberg readily identifies them as Moscow and Tobolosk, but in "Epicenter" he briefly mentions that questions have been raised about those identifications.  Scholars today understand those terms to be names of tribes that lived in the area of modern-day Turkey.  Why does Rosenberg prefer outdated scholarship?  It's worth noting how the author deals with the other nations mentioned in Ezekiel 38.  By the amount of emphasis he places on events in Persia (or modern Iran), he implies that it will be the major ally of Russia in its attack on Israel.  But is that suggestion derived from the text itself, or is that an interpretation Rosenberg imposes on the text in light of current events?  Ezekiel himself does not highlight Persia any more than Cush or Put.  Rosenberg points out that Egypt is not mentioned in Ezekiel 38 as an ally of Russia (p. 132).  That, he suggests, is evidence of Ezekiel's remarkable accuracy since Egypt currently has a peace treaty with Israel.  But in 1970 Hal Lindsey identified Egypt as a key member of Russia's ally called "the King of the South" in Daniel 11.  How can two prophecy experts come to such contradictory conclusions?  Paul Boyer observed in his excellent book, "When Time Shall Be No More."  "While the core structure of the premillennial scenario remained remarkably stable for 150 years, new events were continually elevated to the status of `prophetic fulfillments' or `end-time signs' while individuals or events that failed to live up to their expected role were quietly dropped . . . The historian, reading hundreds of prophecy books published over a two-hundred-year period, can readily see this process of inserting current events into an archaic belief system.  The average believer, encountering the genre for the first time, may be stunned by the uncanny contemporaneity of the prophecies."  Timothy Weber likewise writes in "Living in the Shadow of the Second Coming," "In retrospect, premillennialists had shown more enthusiasm than accuracy in their interpretations . . .  Their leaders were confident that biblical prophecy was being fulfilled, but events kept forcing them to reevaluate their interpretations of how it was being fulfilled.  One is struck by how forgiving and forgetful the premillennialist rank and file must have been during this period.  They stuck by their leaders even when they misread the signs of the times.  The leaders themselves seemed little deterred by their mistakes.  Events were changing so quickly that they had little time for apologies."  While "Epicenter" may become a bestseller, I'm afraid that it will eventually prove to be just another prophetic disappointment.+books
Not what I thought this would be+N+Like other reviewers listed here, I thought this book would focus on the trials and tribulations of cooking recipes that are half-a-century old (if not older)using pithy, witty humor and comparisons of the writer's life and Child's life.  To be fair, there is some of this sprinkled throughout the book, but as an avid cook and Child fan I wish there had been more.  I think there is a market today for food writing; good food writing, like MFK Fisher and Elizabeth David, but I don't think Julie Powell even comes close.  The Julie/Julia Project is a front for this young novelist who see-saws between charming and extremely annoying in her attempts to describe how her life evolves over a one-year period in which she participated (to whatever extent) in some very profound experiences, like working for the government agency dealing with the World Trade Center memorials, a household move in NYC, dealing with a less than stellar marraige, and coping with very needy friends and family.  Julie, get a get a grip on your neurosis and narcissism and just write!  Forget the food, it's just not you.  Stick to your hoo-hum job, your even more narcissistic friends, and your boring marraige and you could be the next Nora Ephron, or at the very least, Erma Bombeck.+books
Think return on INVESTMENT+N+I bought a copy of this book and it IS forcing me to give greater attention to an arguably important part of handicapping, therefore, it might be worth the money.  While Klein's percentage of winners and return-on-investment calculations are adequate for the leaders at the first call, they are without merit for those that do not lead because he dumps both categories in together. This statistical error causes a disparity, but it only "seems" that the ROI between leaders and non-leaders looks larger. But, sheesh, there is only ONE leader but SEVERAL non-leaders. Using basic math, if the win percentage for leaders in a certain category is 30% then the win percentage for non-leaders is 70%.   Using Steve's calculation method, in an 8-horse race you would bet $2 on the leader and $14 (the "non-leaders" times 2)on the non-leaders. Even if a non-leader won there would still be six losers among the non-leaders so the "win percentage" is just 14 percent. Unless the winner pays off at more than 6-1 odds it's a NEGATIVE return-on-investment!  In my opinion, look to other handicapping books for a better return on investment+books
worst book ever+N+I found this book to give some false information and mix up the stories. the dates and names are wrong..needless to say i was dissapointed+books
Tedious+N+As a software developer I found most of the information in this book to be something less than earth shattering.  Basically, there are companies that specialize in data mining as much information on us as they can.  The present administration is drooling over the possibility to use this information.  A large percentage of the information stored in the databases is in error.  That's pretty much the book.  Should we be concerned?  Yes, but not of the information existing because its mostly public information anyway that is being linked in creativie ways.  I'm not an advocate for this by any means but I'm not terribly fearful of it either.  What does concern me, and should you, is how much of the information is wrong and how difficult it is to get these companies to fix it.  To me, that was the greatest point the book made.  As for government spying.  We know now that the government is surveying us in much greater and more Orwellian ways than we would have thought possible.  Unfortunately, this is what I wanted to learn more about and is pretty much missing from the book.  Also, there is no "solution" provided.  How can we protect ourselves?    Mainly, I was disapointed be because every person mentioned in the book has a drawn out biography provided about them.  I really didn't care how the CEO of a data mining company grew up.  I wanted to learn about the subject of the book, not history of indivuals.  Its not a bad book, but I grew tired of the biographies and the content didn't surprise me or frighten me enough to be real impressed+books
My First Jance+P+This was my first Jance novel.  I enjoyed it immensely.  I was surprised until the last page about "who done it" I learned some things about why people keep such large packs of pets. Jance's descriptions made me want to visit the desert. In conversation one evening to a person from the same area, I learned that her descriptions were indeed accurate. This won't be my last Jance novel.  Hope the others are this good+books
Very detailed book.+P+This book contains very good drawings of various craftsman details.  Everything from front doors to various builtins.  The author shows the historic details and how to recreate them with modern construction methods and materials.  There are no color photos, but none are need for the type of book it is.  I would love to have this author release a book on Craftsman Exteriors!!!+books
Slim book+N+The reading was okay, but there wasn't much meat to it. Each page has a paragraph or maybe two that tells a story. Only a handful are interesting as many explain boring stuff like where pictures of old executives are located. One of the most interesting pages told about how Disney bought up all of the FL property using fictitious companies. For the price, I was disappointed as most of it is not notable. If you're a Disney buff, get this from the library and save the $$$ - you can read it in a 1/2 hr sitting+books
A Reader from Irvine+N+I was looking for some christian books that will help me understand the bible better and found this one from the library. Just a glance of this book got me on the alert side. Although the title of the book bears the name of Jesus, it is largely based on the author's personal meditations than the bible. The author refers very little to the bible. And, the chapter "Rise Above Karma" annoys me as it relates "Karma" to the bible teachings. Is not "Karma" a term for Hinduism and Buddhism? What is dangerous about this book is that it mentions the names of God and Jesus so often that without discernment it is easy to mistake this book as one of the christian books. The bible tells us to beware of teachings like this+books
Smart and satisfying!+P+Stealing for a Living is much than a mystery.  The character at the center of the story is razor-sharp and a compelling narrator.  Great ideas throughout, and a great plot, too+books
sorry to those who missed out+P+I just wanted to say, I'm sorry to those who gave this book a low rating.  you really have missed out on some amazing things God can tell you through this book.  I have read this book and it changed my life - reminded me of the real order of things and led me to a deeper listening for God's voice.  The more you listen the more you will recognize and hear it. I also have 2 other friends who's lives changed after reading this book as well.  I'm talking major changes+books
Great Advice, but no follow through+N+When I got this book, I couldn't put it down.  After reading it, I was anxious to get started on setting my goals as Mr Brown described in chapter 16, but I hit a roadblock.  Mr. Brown gives an example of the goal planner, but he didn't show how the math works to get the amount one should save each month.  Mr. Brown even states,  "The following goal-setting forms will serve as a map in guiding you toward your desired financial goals.  They are here to assist you in your planning.  Feel free to use the formula over and over again for your actual desires."  One frustrating problem, Mr. Brown gives NO FORMULAS.  I followed up by going to Mr. Brown's company website and sending an e-mail explaining my frustration, I got a reply telling me to visit the website and click on "need a financial plan."  This requires me to enter in my credit card information and be charged $25 for Mr. Brown to preform the calculations for me (the same calculations that should be outlined in Chapter 16).  In addition, I get a free copy of a book that I just bought.  WHAT?!  I bought this book expecting to be given the tools to be independent when setting up my goals.  Or at least to understand how calculations are made before I seek out professional help.  But Mr Brown only brought me halfway when he suggests ways to set up goals and then in turn doesn't fully explain them.+books
I was glad to read all the low reviews...+N+I was actually glad to read all of the low reviews because I felt like a traitor when I didn't like this book.  I wanted to like it, I really did - but it was very dull.  I ended up skimming most of it because it didn't hold my interest at all.  The first chapter started out with a bang and I was totally hooked.  It didn't take long to lose me.  Boooooring.  I didn't like Sophie, I didn't like Royd (Royd - are you kidding?  Perhaps the author should invest in a baby name book - there are much better choices for names out there.).  I wasn't interested in the direction the book went.    I thought the action scenes were ridiculous compared to the every day scenes.  If Sophie could pull off the every day scenes like she did the action scenes we wouldn't have had such a boring book.  She was da bomb during breaking and entering and getting away but she was pathetic at any other time.  Royd was so very unlikeable I couldn't believe they ended up in bed together.  Ick.  Adding Jane into the book was very contrived.  Plain old artist Jane and her cop stepfather Joe saved the boy from a ruthless trained killer?  It seemed like a ploy to connect Eve Duncan with this book.  Not at all believable.  The one sentence that I found interesting was when Michael thought that Jane resembled or looked like someone familiar.  It seemed to be a lead in to the next book.  The first IJ book I ever read was Ugly Duckling.  Hopefully IJ re-reads that one before starting the next one.  Give us a strong heroine who overcomes her trauma and kicks [...].  +books
Very Weak Entry in the Series+N+Like many others, I'm a big fan of the Ladies No. 1 Detective Agency series, but this is a really poor entry that barely even bothers to go through the motions. First of all, Mma Ramotswe has only one case to deal with, a wealthy woman who wants her four suitors checked out to eliminate any golddiggers. The first two she checks out are interesting enough, a bible-thumper seeking to reform bar girls, and a slick radio DJ. But Smith doesn't even get around to the other two, and wraps up that storyline in a very abrupt way. Another plotline revolves around Mr. J.L.B. Matakoni and a dishonest competitor garage, but this is small potatoes that doesn't really amount to much. A third plotline involves Mr. J.L.B. Matakoni's getting dragooned into a parachute jump to raise money for the orphanage, again, doesn't amount to much. The last major plotline concerns the marriage between Mma Ramotswe and Mr. J.L.B. Matakoni -- or rather, the lack thereof. The resolution to this is completely anti-climatic and doesn't do justice to the event. One might forgive the weak plotting if there was some really juicy character development, but there isn't. Even worse, some major characters almost totally disappear: Mma Makutsi has very little role, and the two orphan children adopted by Mr. J.L.B. Matakoni appear only once or twice. The book's got the same warmth and humor as the rest of the series, but it's all sort of perfunctory. One doesn't get nearly the same feel for the country and people. The overall is like looking forward to a weekend visit with old friends, only to find them totally distracted and distant. Big bummer of a book.+books
The Shia Revival+P+Informative, detailed and factual review of the history of conflict between Shias and Sunnis. The book draws inciteful connections between current events in the Middle East and these historic conflicts.The author quite clearly demonstrates how our current approach in Iraq did not take these issues into accouint. If Bush could read, he should have read this book. +books
A work of mature genius by a great writer+P+This under-appreciated work is slowly gaining the recognition it deserves from Woolf critics... but I would say that, since I wrote my dissertation on it! Woolf's fiction is never light reading, but Woolf lovers will here  find a masterful synthesis of descriptive power, her exhaustive knowledge  of English history and literature, her feminism, her passionate hatred of  war and her conviction that only aesthetic experience can enable humanity  to question the status quo and *perhaps* create a better world...  interested readers might consider reading it alongside The Years, Three  Guineas, Moments of Being, the last volumes of the diary, or such Woolf  essays as &quot;Thoughts on Peace During an Air Raid,&quot; as well as  Shakespeare's Tempest. This slim novel speaks volumes; it is a work of  mature genius by one of the 20th century's greatest writers+books
Highly Recommended+P+Very Imformative and cites work which is much appreciated, when reading a book like this it is important to know that you aren't reading a bunch of made up information. The book touches on a wide range of issues and is good for anyone wanting to know more about what they are eating and how it effects everyone and everything around them.+books
Another self-indulgent Heinlein novel+N+Heinlein loads this book up with hooks in the early pages to catch your attention.  Unfortunately, these hooks turn out to be superfluous and lead nowhere.  This shoddy technique is found in all four of Hienlein's final books.  We are also treated to some of Heinlein's stock characters, dirty old men, horny female computers, naked adolescent girls, and dominant beauties who would be right at home in leather and whips.  Without these archetype characters most Heinlein novels written after 1970 would have a sparse population indeed.  As if this isn't enough, Heinlein drags in his usual cast of characters from his other novels as he is so prone to doing.  In spite of all their cameo appearances, this group remains dull and one dimensional throughout.  Heinlein's earlier novels written prior to 1960 are still fine fare for young people, especially boys.  This novel, as well as most of Heinlein's later work will be enjoyed primarily by a group of die hard fans and is definitely not for general consumption+books
This book was almost physically painful to read+N+Unfortunately, I was forced to read this book by my photography professor. Every word, every page, was sheer hell to struggle through. Trying to follow Barthe's chaotic train of thought is next to impossible. This book is full of navel-gazing gibberish that can only loosely be described as "English". He admits to not being a photographer, and goes on to claim photography itself doesn't exist. How then, did he write a whole monstrous book on photography? And moreover, why am I being subjected to it?  My heart is warmed somewhat when I read of Mr. Barthe's history. He spent a lifetime suffering from tuberculosis, and ended it splattered across the front of a van. Good. The bastard deserved it for what he's inflicted on hapless undergrads around the world.+books
A Two For Effort+N+This book is written from the viewpoint of a flaming socialist with the attitude that anything white or European or is overly valued in American history textbooks.  Loewen does have many valid points about what history textbooks omit, but the degree to which he is clearly slanted to the left is ludicrous.  "Lies My Teacher Told Me" could have been an amazing book, but all it did was aggrivate me and motivate me to write a 23 page paper debunking half of what the author wrote, much to the dismay of my idiotic Sociology professor.  The only reason I didn't give the book 1 star is because the overall intent and effort put forth were good, but the book as a whole is just far too biased+books
Silly (satirical) look at a very serious subject.+P+When I first started reading this book, the story seemed so outlandish that it all seemed too silly.  Soon, though, I realized that it was a satirical look at a serious subject (censorship) and that the humor was actually a very effective way of getting the point across.  The story is told in letters, predominantly between 19-yo cousins Tassie and Ella but occasionally in letters from or to their parents, neighbors and the Nazi-like town council that begins prohibiting the use of letters of the alphabet as they fall from their hero's statue (Nollop, inventor of the sentence "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog."--of note because it contains every letter of the English alphabet).  The idea that a government, especially one in a society as literate and as committed to honoring the English language as this one, would strangle its citizens with such laws is ludicrous; it is not only interesting but amusing to see how the community deals with the laws and their effects.  First, like sheep being led to slaughter and, later, taking charge of their own destinies.  I found Ella Minnow Pea a very quick and enjoyable read.  It is light and funny but yet gives you something to think about.  If you are a fan of language, you will likely enjoy it.  It is rare that I come across a book that has a word in it with which I am not familiar; this book contained MANY words unfamiliar to me--a truly impressive level of vocabulary (though some words were, I think, coined by the islanders as a way of dealing with the prohibited letters).  I recommend this book--especially for those who, like I, are concerned about the direction OUR society is taking in terms of censorship+books
Big History, Written Small+N+Englishman Tony Judt's POSTWAR is an ambitious and worthwhile undertaking: to give a coherent account of the history of Europe from 1945. The outline of events is well known: a continent in ruins at the end of the Second World War, the miraculous rise of Western Europe from the wreckage, the concurrent enslavement of the East, and thence the titanic struggle between the two world systems, culminating in the triumph of liberal democracy over totalitarian state control. It is a great story, surely one of the finest chapters in the history of human civilization.  Judt seems to take the view (with which most people would likely agree) that great shifts in history ultimately rest upon the underlying economics. In the big picture, Communism failed because it was unproductive, capitalism succeeded because it was the opposite. The question he asks is a good one: why did it happen when it did? Why, after having survived so long (since 1917, in the case of the Soviets) did the Eastern Block suddenly collapse at the end of the eighties, and so rapidly?   His answer is, astonishingly, the Helsinki Accords. "Against all expectation," he claims, "it [Brezhnev's signing of the Helsinki Accords] was to prove mortal." (p. 503). The argument here seems to be that by having agreed to the Helsinki Accords (which included some boilerplate language on human rights), the Communist leaders were thereafter hamstrung in suppressing those dissidents who dressed their opposition in terms of human rights rather than as political attacks against the Party.  He thus attributes the collapse of Communism to the role of dissenters within the non-Soviet Eastern Block countries. Judt seems not to have grasped that these countries were just the playing field, not the actual players. He refers to himself as having been in Czechoslovakia at this time; perhaps this is why he seems to think that the minor protest groups within the Soviet satellites were something other than marginal--as causal agents rather than benefactors of larger forces. In this book, Vaclav Havel plays a far greater role than Ronald Reagan in the collapse of Communism. In fact the name "Reagan" itself only appears a dozen or so times--in other words, it is rarely cited, and then usually in the off-hand manner with which those who wish they had influence dismiss those who do. (Reagan's speech at the Berlin Wall is not even mentioned, something hard to fathom in an 800-page history of postwar Europe.)  Eventually, the anti-American streak which runs through this book from the beginning emerges into plain sight: "But it should not be concluded...that it was American encouragement or support which precipitated or facilitated their [Eastern Europe's] liberation." (p. 631) and then later, equally bluntly, "...[despite] the self-congratulatory narrative that has entered the American public record, Washington did not `bring down' Communism, Communism imploded of its own accord." (p. 659.)  Really? Who would have thought that forty years of American effort in the Cold War was just a waste of time?  This proposition is such obvious nonsense that it really does not need to be argued against, but the wonder is that someone who appears to understand the function of economics in history can fail to appreciate the central role of America, and specifically of the American taxpayer, in postwar Europe. America paid for Europe's reconstruction (Marshall Plan). America paid for Europe's welfare states (by relieving their governments of the need to pay for their own defense, and also in the form of endless credits and loans). America paid for Europe's economic prosperity (by bankrolling the agencies which funded it--such as the IMF & World Bank--and by opening American markets to European goods while allowing European markets to remain subsidized and protected; something that is still the case today, from agriculture to Airbus). And finally, it was America who paid for the Soviet's defeat. Without America, modern Europe would not exist.  Yes, it is undeniable that Communism rotted from the inside. But rot by itself does not cause collapse (otherwise how to explain North Korea, a long-bankrupt thugocracy that survived even the death of the former thug-in-chief?) Such states continue to exist indefinitely, until given a push. And so to answer Judt's own question: the reason Communism collapsed when it did was because America pushed. Ronald Reagan reversed American policy and stood up to the Soviets, and did so at a time when the major Western European states were cowering in postures of supplication and appeasement (Thatcher's UK excepted). It had nothing to do with the Helsinki Accords.  Judt flatters himself in the preface that his book will be controversial, but to this reader his conclusions are too silly to be worthy of controversy. They are simply wrong.  It is a pity Judt fails here. The fundamental lesson to be drawn from the history of postwar Europe is that it is no good trying to make friends with the schoolyard bully--or to give him your lunch money in order not to get beaten up (the European response). The lesson is that you must stand up to bullies. Appeasement in all its guises--rapprochement, Ostpolitik, engagement, detente, Nixon/Kissinger-style scheming, or Carter's endless vacillation--inevitably leads to failure. And when the bill finally comes due, as it always does, then the accrued interest can be enormously costly in human life. This was true in Munich in 1938, and it remains true today.   Given the current state of the world, we could have used a book which reminded us of this basic truth right now.  There are numerous errors and omissions, mostly minor (Iceland is missing from the cover maps), occasionally more significant (For example, there is no understanding that the repeated attacks by American hedge funds against the weak European currencies did much more than just blow England and Italy out of the ERM in 1992. They also forced a hugely embarrassing French devaluation in 1993--in the form of widened intervention bands--and imposed a hitherto unknown market rigor upon the respective governments, basically requiring them to depoliticize monetary policy and rein in fiscal policy--major changes in how these governments governed. The attacks also contributed to the ready adoption of the Euro, as a collective defense against George Soros.) But any book of this scope will contain errors and omissions; in fact the strength of POSTWAR is its vast collection of facts and figures and statistics (although weakened by the lack of source citations.) It is in the small-scale work of collecting data that Judt succeeds. It is in the big-scale work of interpreting those data that he fails. For example, toward the end of the book there is an account of the disaster in the Balkans following the break up of Yugoslavia. Judt correctly identifies the nadir of postwar Europe: the slaughter at Srebrenica, in which 7400 Muslims were murdered under the noses of Dutch soldiers serving under UN command. He then goes on to contrast the situation when NATO took over, at which point the slaughters promptly stopped, and ten years of peace ensued (enduring to this day). Surely this is something to which you would ask: Why? The answer is simple: the UN force, as is usual with UN forces, was too small, had a weak and compromised mandate, was composed of soldiers who were inadequately equipped and commanded, and who operated under unrealistic rules of engagement. But the NATO force tolerated no nonsense, they came in with the intention of standing up to the Serbs, and had the ROE to do it. The Serb `army' (if thugs who slaughter civilians can be dignified with such a term) promptly collapsed.  Same lesson: bullies must be stood up to. Perhaps it is the fact that the force was American-led which prevented Judt from seeing this.  (At the time of writing, the UN is once again dithering in the same old way on the same old issue--this time in Lebanon and Darfur--a perfect example of why we should learn from the past instead of repeating it, as seems all but inevitable right now. What a sorry institution the UN has become!)  Judt gives some good detail of postwar political theory on the continent--something usually missing from English-language accounts, other than the obvious observation that such theory was mainly Marxist. Sartre and Camus were predictable, Foucault less so (a substantial presence in France, but more or less unknown in America). Judt appears to come from the political left himself, but nevertheless he seems not to have understood the basis of Foucault (which can be summed up, Deep Throat-like, as "follow the power.") In Foucaultian terms, the discourse of dissent (which Judt claims collapsed Communism) was something entirely dictated by the power relations existing at the time. He would have said look not at the surface, look at the constellations (a favorite Foucaultian term) of power. Any objective survey of the constellations of power existing in Europe in 1989 would center on the United States (and might still do so today, despite a united Germany, an expanded EU, and the absence of the Soviet threat.) In explaining the collapse of Communism, historical roads as diverse as euro-Marxism, macroï¿½-economics, empirical rationalism or even Great Man theory all lead to the same place: America. But according to Judt, Washington had nothing to do with it.  By the final chapters, any pretense of objectivity has been lost. 9/11 was not a watershed horror for the free world, but a passing American event that by implication the US deserved for its Middle Eastern policy. (Of all European leaders since 1945, Judt reserves his strongest denunciation not for Stalin or Tito or Ceausescu, but for Tony Blair. Why? Blair supports American policy--"blindly," of course.) In summing up what (Judt thinks) binds Europeans together, it is "...contrast with `the American' way of life.' (p. 748)  Lastly, not just the content but the style is likely to be tiresome to American readers. There is an overabundance of smug English circumlocutions and double-negatives: "It was not for nothing," "not perhaps terribly," and the like. Meaningless modifiers, such as "more than a little" and "decidedly," are used ad nauseum, so that the text sometimes reads like a student essay in which the author has tried padding it out to make the required number or words. Judt could learn from the great English historians of the past, of whom there are plenty, from Gibbon to Churchill. There is in POSTWAR none of their directness of language, that firm relentless empiricism which at its best ascends into epic prose, noble in conception and majestic in scope. It is what makes reading them such a pleasure, whatever they have to say. Reading Judt is just a chore.  In the end this book, for all its size, is just a sour little pamphlet--an insult to the achievement that it purports to explain. It is the written equivalent of those old photographs of Soviet leaders gathered atop Lenin's Tomb on May Day, in which the images of the purged party members have been carefully airbrushed out--except that in POSTWAR, it is not just a party hack but the main player who is missing. POSTWAR is not even bad history, it is non-history, just anti-American propaganda dressed up as scholarship.  It should sell well in France.+books
Unanticipated Anne Shirley Back In Action!+P+Red haired with a flaming temper, the phenomenal Anne Shirley is back in her 2nd book! Marilla, a kindly old maid who had set heart on bringing Anne up (when she was an orphan) has decided to also adopt two adorable little twins, Davy and Dora Keith. Anne is absolutely thrilled but adopting these twins causes big trouble. Davy is really a good boy at heart but always finds himself into scrapes: like making his sister Dora walk the pig fence! Davy??s idea of fun includes violence and humor ?V but only for himself. The girls have to teach Davy manners, which is a difficult task for such a cheeky little boy. Anne??s problems grow even more as she takes up responsibility of being a schoolteacher and suddenly feels very timid again, but she has to pull up her socks and jerk herself back into the adult world. At school, she regains her impertinence temper and broad imaginations as she shares happy times with her students, especially Paul Irving, this sweet little kid with brown hair and the most delightful face she has ever seen. He brings her flowers and calls her ??Sweet Teacher??. Her friendship with striking Gilbert Blythe (ex-enemy for calling her hair ??carrots??) has grown, but what is Gilberts real reason of being so sweet and pleasant? Has Diana (her bosom friend) finally grown up? I really enjoyed this book because it talks about Anne growing up and finding her place in the adult world leaving her wonderful childhood behind forever. I simply couldn??t put it down because after every page, Anne has another adventure so it is like a cliffhanger. My mom keeps telling me to go and do work but I cannot stop because this is the most wonderful book ever written. I like the others in this series also.Thank you L.M.

All these talents and the final encounter with this terrible monster is so anticlimatic it made me resent having wasted my time with the novel.  And the ending . . . . horrible.  It was as if Koontz thought the audience of this novel would be teenagers looking for something like R.L. Stine would write.  I'd give it a half a star if I could+books
Very Interesting Read +P+The best parts of The Lost Painting: The Quest for a Caravaggio Masterpiece, by Jonathan Harr, deal with the artist himself.  When most artists are considered eccentric, Caravaggio was a renegade in his actions.  A fighter.  He killed a man, and lived his last years on the run.  Many of his paintings were initially discounted, but his popularity grew in later years.  I enjoyed the book, and found the idea of these lost masterpieces, valued in the tens of millions of dollars, to be out there somewhere very fascinating.  Four stars & recommended. +books
Is this book for real?+N+This is the first DS book that I have read in about 20 years & it made me realize why did I try again???????  Can I really find a book centered around a 70 year old male stud-muffin real?  I wonder to myself if anyone has ever portrayed a 70 year old female stud muffin? I would hope as we age we would like to be portrayed with a bit more substance.    Coop only dates 20 something's.  He has a 20 something porn star black-mailing him that she is pregnant with his child.  This doesn't bother his new girlfriend, an (early 30's) resident Pediatrician, who works in ICU with preemies at all, who tells him to "have her get an abortion".  A bit too blasï¿½ for me.  Coop is supposed to be unbelievable beautiful & sexy.  I had a hard time getting into this premise.    The way DS totally changes his character toward the end is unbelievable.  Everyone falls in love all of the sudden with the other characters.  Every character is, of course, extremely wealthy (even though several are hiding it). Most characters are extremely beautiful & look many years younger than they are.  I realize we read to escape but this was a bit too much even for DS.  +books
is not a good start from here +N+sorry to say that i'm very dissapointed to own this book. For those who are new to VBA, it is not a good start from here. I also find that the example and the function covered is not practical enough to use to develop your own program. I would recomend a book written by John Walkenbach which the examples and function cover more practical+books
Disappointing+N+This novel in Dunning's series about Cliff Janeway, bookseller sleuth, reads quite rough. It is an EASY read because of the unusually large print for a trade paperback, but the plot is disjointed and leaves huge loose ends (and no sign of a sequel). The central section is largely irrelevant to this story and unrequited (but contains a commercial warning to be seriously heeded by booklovers). The good guys and bad guys are caricatures and too easy to spot (with one VERY key exception), while Cliff now is almost bad with simply too hostile a personality. Finally, the ending is more hilariously awkward, quick, and sketchy than it is scary or satisfying. "In a word," this novel is rough, unfinished, hasty, indulgent, a discourtesy by author and editor.   Dunnings first two Janeway mysteries (Booked to Die & The Bookman's Wake) were stunningly different, fresh, and invited me into a world of books, while his Two O'Clock Eastern Wartime was a fascinating radio/love story. The Bookman's Promise was strange and now Sign of the Book is shockingly disappointing. If I happened to read this one first I doubt I would read anothe+books
Would Not Buy+N+Not helpful for me.  It contained mostly definitions of terms, no useful follow thru information.  Other books I have found are more percise. +books
He needs to learn what a "proof" is+N+This textbook relies on more handwaving arguments than my Quantum textbook! Griffiths seems to be under the impression that he is an astounding mathematician and the reader can barely integrate. The "proofs" of almost every key concept are either fleshed out in "Well suppose... then this might happen..." or altogether left to the reader. It was a fun challenge to actually write a proof for a lot of them, too... maybe Griffiths should have tried it when he wrote the book. If the reader does every single problem in the book, he or she may have a mid-undergrad level understanding of basic E&M. Very little relativity, and no Quantum mechanical aspects are covered (if I remember correctly)+books
Most depressing book I have read in a long time+P+Phillips nails it. And it's coming here to a city near you+books
Challenging, but worth it!+P+The Road to Serfdom is a book that you see recommended on many reading lists, and for good reason.  Hayek shows the reader, from many different directions, why socialism is doomed to failure.  He carefully explains why socialism in its pure form leads, inevitably, to totalitarianism.  Hayek's illustrations and explanations are quite clear.    I found myself somewhat challenged by Hayek's writing style.  Make no mistake, this can be a somewhat difficult book to read.  Keep in mind though, that it is a book that should be read a little at a time and pondered upon.  The first chapter seemed to be the most difficult.  If you can make it through the first chapter, then you are home free.  In the end, I was fascinated by this book.  Hayek's ability to see in 1944 what became apparent only many years later to most of his contemporaries, is remarkable.  Even though this is no easy read, its more than worth the effort.     +books
FEIST.....You couldn't do better than steal old Marvel Comic Storylines?+N+The Riftwar was a good saga.  Pug was good.  Tomas was good.  Arutha was good.  Everything was good.  Then Feist came out with this series...  Anyone who wants to know the plotline for this one just save yourself the money and read the Atlantis attacks comic books by Marvel, the Eternals by Jack Kirby, and the Fantastic #337-340 and then you'll easily see where Feist stole this storyline from.    A dreaming Mad God that influences a world around him, that's buried under a mountain, whose thoughts become reality?/A dreaming Black Celestial from a race of space gods who is buried under a mountain and can control reality around him and is trying to destroy the universe?  C'mon, I can't believe I'm the only who has seen this.  Everyone takes ideals from someone, hence Tolkien syndrome, but to couple it with this sorry book(ie a stupid book where a stupid Pug that throws fireballs but can't dodge them and can't time travel like in other books and can't deal with a minor demon captain)insults the people that made the Dreaming Celestial(KING KIRBY) and the Eternals.  If he was gonna steal ideas, he should have made the entire book worthwhile.  In this book, besides the old guard, Erik is the only guy we really care about.  Characters that were developed in the two lackluster books before are killed off before they have a chance to sign and we're left with characters like Miranda, whom we don't reall any thing for at all.  All in all, a very poor effort in the Serpentwar saga.  Feist gets an A for stealing storylines and an F for originality.  I'll stick to newer guys like Simon R Green, Aaron Mccarty, and Ferrenzano for new takes on fantasy/sci fi.+books
Neat!+P+This game is great for young computer-users!  Each page has at least 15 &quot;interactions&quot; -- i.e. clicking on the salt shakers in the  kitchen makes them dance.  The story can read itself to you are you can  read it silently.  Even clicking on one word makes the computer say it.   Great for children just learning to read.  However, using it TOO many times  can get tiring...after all, it is just a computerized book.  Great value  for the money+books
Phenomenal+P+I cannot think of a funnier novel written in the last century.  If Toole were still with us, he'd be the Mark Twain of New Orleans+books
Misrepresented Information+N+This is a book that accepts the final outcome being that divorce is OK if you have tried certain steps.  Too many stories that support divorce are enclosed.  I would not recommend this book to anyone who wants a marriage to work.  This book should be called "Reasons Why I Should Go"..+books
Considerations+P+I will agree with some that this work can often be confusing in Tacitus failure to fully explain new characters as they suddenly appear as if from no where, but the narrative is smooth, never tiresome, and it must be  considered that it was written more than a thousand years ago and has been  left to us in a mutilated form.  Despite these small drawbacks Tacitus is  still Rome's greatest ancient historian and the greatest stylist in the  Latin language+books
so nazism is back+N+Hey here's an idea. What if Hitler was right all along, only it is men, not jews, who are to blame for all the woes of the world. We should build a new Auschwitz and exterminate them all. Right Andrea? In my opinion, this is just as bad as any misogynist. It's ridiculous garbage like this that has set the women's liberation movement back for so long+books
Not my favorite+P+Perhaps the most amazing thing about this book is the reaction to it by various readers.  Those who detested it said it was because of the violence.  Those who like it apparently liked it because it was by Nora Roberts.  There are the usual Nora Roberts fixtures here:  a beautiful, independent, tough heroine; R-rated sex scenes; handsome and talented lovers; flowers, etc.  It has been touted by some as a mystery of sorts, but there's nothing very mysterious about it.  Anyone who doesn't know who the arsonist is after the first fire hasn't paid much attention.  In fact, I kept wanting to tell Reena to wake up and go get him.  Perhaps the biggest departure from Ms. Roberts' previous books (for me, at least) is the rather humdrum atmosphere.  Ambience is the writer's strongest suit in other works--Alaska in winter, an island off Boston, Chesapeake Bay, Ireland, Louisiana etc.  Old Baltimore neighborhoods and a pizza shop aren't quite the same.  Still, the writing is mostly good and I kept reading.  A second-rate Nora Roberts book is still more interesting than most other novels being published today+books
didactic support+P+This book is truly helping me to understand which reactions my own behaviour will provoke and to prepare my reactions to unexpected behaviours.+books
An extrodinary year for Shakespeare+P+This is one of the best books I have read dealing with Shakespeare. Becuase it has such a specific focus, the year 1599, it is able to take an indepth look at some of Shakespeare's best work. The book focuses on some of Shakespeare's best plays: Julius Ceaser, As You Like It, and Hamlet, but unlike so many other Shakesperian analysis he does not look at this only from a literary standpoint Shapirio looks at it from a historical view. Shapirio chronicles the events in Shakespeare's life and in local and global politics that would effect what he was writting in a particular year. This specificity of this topic allows Shapirio to fully engage the reader in intresting and unique analysis of very well known plays. Though this book is detailed and very focused it is by no means dull. This book is engaging and witty throughout. I would strongly reccomend this to anyone intrested Shakespeare or the Elizabethan Era.+books
A Thinking Horse and His Man+P+This is an excellent and accurate account of a horse that learned to spell and do simple math.  It is also an amazing story of the emancipated slave who trained him. It gives an excellent history of the time after the civil war. It changed my view of what is possible. I was taught in psychology 101 that the horse Gentle Hans was a fraud and that he had learned to pick up unconscious cues from his trainer, that he wasn't really able to think.  Beautiful Jim Key proved without a doubt that he was able to spell and do math and make change. Wonderful history+books
a dying world?+P+Like the author i can remember the books i read as a child (with great fondness), i have those books even today, and like her they are my old and familiar friends. But unlike her most of those books have been nonfiction, for i thought/think those were the way to see the real world. After reading this book i realize that the gap i thought existed between nonfiction and fiction isn't really important. For she sees books, like i imagine most readers do, as a funny kind of mirror which reflects the reader's inner world at the same time as displaying the author's world. I think the gap is between readers and nonreaders, who like those described this book as visual or picture people, identify with films rather than books.  The book is a memoir which asks the big question on our reading minds-- does it matter if i can't remember what is in the books? She answers it- "For in the end, even if all my books where to vanish, I would still have them somewhere, if I had read them attentively enough.  Maybe the words on the page are not even the true book, in the end only a gateway to the book which recreates in the mind and lasts as long as we do."   The book is a real treat for anyone who like her, is often asked, "haven't you wasted your life, by reading rather than experiencing life?"  She answers this with the thought that her life is so intertwined with the books she has read and thereby experienced, and so made a part of her. That it doesn't matter, which is books and which is real life for they together make her, her. It's a good book, short, poignant with echoes and parallels apparent to any readers life. Go for it, spend a pleasant hour with this book+books
Wow! It's An Oprah Pick!!!+N+I should know by now that anything Oprah spotlights will be fluff with a healthy dose of dimestore philosophy.  But this tome pegs the Kumbayaometer.  I don't know what was worse, Morrie's trite, Godless, and lapsed-Jewish advice to "be nice to those we love" or Mitch Albom's profiteering off a friend's gruesome ALS death. What is it with America that we flock to this shallow I'm okay-You're okay amoral clap-trap and treat it as profundity?  Is it because it excuses all our immoral behavior and builds our self-esteem which is the real god of this age? As a sidebar, what is it with Oprah and her ilk?  That a woman of questionable morals who shacks up without marriage and supports abortion on demand is held up as a moral compass for so many escapes all thoughtful logic.  Safe to say, anything written by the tirelessly self-promoting Albom should be avoided and anything The Big O pushes should be rejected out of hand. By the way, I read this drivel in a Barnes and Noble while I waited for a phone call one afternoon.  If you must read it, get it at a library and keep the money from getting to Mitch+books
Objective, direct, accurate: Excellent+P+In The Society of the Muslim Brothers, Richard P. Mitchell addresses the ideology of the organization. He takes the reader from the birth of the movement that would eventually challenge the Egyptian government to it's greatest and worst moments. He writes with an amazingly objective style, neither apologizing for the members who committed crimes, nor minimalizing the excellent social welfare contributions of Hassan Al-Banna, the leader. Of particular interest in this discussion of dualities is the point made about the dual legal systems. Al-Banna felt that the Western laws "corrupted and perverted the nation's thought, mind and logic."  Mitchell's point on this seems to hold vivid clarity in the idea that manmade laws and shari'a are innately incompatible. The inharmonious combination of this dual legal system "served to shatter the `unity' of the nation." Mitchell's writing really catches the essence of a group of people struggling to come to terms with a rapidly changing society in flux in a rapidly changing world. His book was translated into Arabic and Arab scholars agree that his portrayal of this politically powerful religious movement is academically sound+books
Disappointing mystery thriller+N+Sometimes I've enjoyed books by David Baldacci (WISH YOU WELL and THE WINNER come to mind); others, such as THE LAST MAN STANDING did little for me . . . add SPLIT SECOND, which I just heard, to that latter list . . . it was a disappointing mystery thriller about two disgraced Secret Service agents who come together to solve two campaign-trail crimes . . . I cared little about any of the characters, and there were far too many subplots floating around for my taste . . . the ending also didn't do much for me, as it brought too many separate threads together in too quick a fashion . . . lastly, I did not particularly "buy" the man behind the crimes; he just wasn't  all that believable.+books
Finally! A simple solution!+P+One of the missing components to the concept of teaching "social skills" to children and young adults on the autism spectrum, is that instructors focus on textbook manners instead of teaching REAL life practical knowledge. The Hidden Curriculum explains that every society has unstated rules, the things that no one explains to you, but which you are supposed to pick up somehow on your own. Remember how awkward and geeky most of us were in Jr. High? And there were always the "cool kids" who somehow knew just how to dress, just what to say and meanwhile you (and I) were clueless? It's because they understood the unstated rules, they had an unkanny ability to pick up the exact tools necessary for "coolness." As we grow up, we learn better how to adapt to social situations, we know how to behave in a variety of settings, even perhaps cross culturally. Adults grow into a sense of ease in our surroundings, we know what we are supposed to do. Now, imagine that you never got over that awkward phase, you were perpetually spending your life roaming around trying to figure out the world with little to go on. No one pulled you aside and explained, "This is how it is, Kid." That's exactly what it's like for our kids on the spectrum. Well, here comes The Hidden Curriculum to the rescue! Not only does it explain many of these "unstated rules" (many of which are humorous--who doesn't know you should take tuna in your school lunch because it stinks? many of our AS kids!) It also goes beyond to explain how to uncover them. It highlights how crucial it is for us as parents, as educators and just as a society to literally pull our AS folks aside and say, "These are the rules." For example, "Don't pick your nose." Good advice right? But p-leeeze, everybody picks their nose! (Okay, not me, but everybody else! :-) What we really need to teach our kids is not, don't pick your nose, but not to pick their nose where people can see them. Sound silly? Our children and friends on the autism spectrum just need for us to teach them one little tidbit like this every day and they'll find their way with increasing ease. And wouldn't you have liked someone to pull you aside in Jr. High and done the same for you? Let's equip our kids with the real skills to make their way in the world. The Hidden Curriculum does just that!+books
a long book that seems to get longer as you read it+N+The relationships between the various characters weren't convincing and I failed to connect to the main character, Lottie, at all.  The book seemed to ramble on, and didn't catch my interest.  There were a few parts where the action picks up, but they were like tiny islands surrounded by a vast ocean of blandness+books
The Senator and The Socialite: The True Story...+P+The Senator and the Socialite:... is the story of Reconstruction Senator from Mississippi Blanche Bruce.   Although an excellect book about Reconstruction and how an ambitious former slave could posper and become a Plantation owner himself and game the corrupt political system to become a U.S. Senator, the real story here is about black society, skin color and how one family managed to thrive in it. At least for a couple of generations.  This book is an excellent read along with "Redemption" by Nicholas Leman+books
STUNNED (in a good way)+P+First, let me say that I am a very independent, very headstrong, liberal wife who has a higher education than her husband (masters' degree), owns a business and takes no B.S. from anyone.  When this book came out, I truly thought it was a joke.  WHO WOULD WRITE A BOOK LIKE THIS OUTSIDE OF THE 1950s?!  And WHERE IS THE "PROPER CARE... OF WIVES"?!  To add 'insult', a coworker of my husband (whose wife stays at home with their 4 kids because they feel that this is THE role wives are SUPPOSED TO take on), is the one who offered to lend it to me.  I thought, "this will be interesting" but can't criticize until giving it a shot, right???  Ok - there's the background - here's the review:  I couldn't put the book down and read it in a just over a day.  While I don't agree 100% with all that Dr. Laura says, and as another reviewer commented that there are parts that men may find insulting, this book has changed my life, and as a result it has changed my husband's life - both for the better.  After 7 years of marriage, we are clicking like we never have before.  I can't explain it to you, or to my married best friends whose jaws dropped as I confessed to them over margaritas that I NOT ONLY READ the book but I LOVED the book.    All I can say is that the foundation makes sense.  It doesn't bash working women - Dr. Laura is one, after all.  But it does point out, not so discreetly, that your family - the family you have chosen to create - should come above all else.  And that the EXTREMISM of some aspects of the feminist movement is self-destructive to women, men and society as a whole.  And as I turned each page and as I tried to rebel against some parts (I shouldn't BURDEN him with the tales of MY day??!), peel away the layers, let down your defenses and let it make sense.  (It isn't that my day is less significant, but men and women communicate differently - vent to him about your day and he'll feel like a second class citizen and a failure for not being able to fix your stress.  Vent to your girlfriends and they'll dish with you!  Focus your time on your husband, family, relationship, etc., once you get home instead.)  AND LET ME TELL YA once you leave the work day at the door, your home becomes YOUR HOME again, too.  So it's win-win!  REALLY!!!  Dr. Laura's book includes parts and pieces of past calls and letters, which is a helpful, practical demonstration of her points and breaks things up so you don't feel like you're getting a lecture (especially if you are ready to admit you've been doing a few thngs wrong!).  And as you can see the lightbulb go on with average Janes all over the country and across time in the dialogue- from them pushing back on her advice to (aha!) getting her message during their conversations, you see the pettiness we can cling to and frankly, the underlying simplicity in each of her messages.  OK - still skeptical? Then rent it at the library for free and give it a shot.  Just TRY to put her ideas into practice - commit to changing for a week (if you aren't sold on changing your life)... What's the worst that can happen?  If it's all wrong for you, you have just lost a quick week and you can pat yourself on the back for being right and you can write your own book. ;-)  But just think - what if it WORKS?!  Then you will find a new meaning in your life that you didn't know you were missing.  You will have a much happier and rewarding marriage.  Your husband will adore you.  (Sounds rough, huh?)    TRUST ME - I'm not about to become a submissive, mindless person rather than an equal partner in a relationship.  But as I made a few MINOR tweaks in how I treat the man I chose to marry and spend the rest of my life with, I have received rewards from him 10-fold.  And to think I thought I was doing it 'right' all along. ;0)   +books
Pompous, elitist crap+N+What a load of garbage.  Equating a camera with a gun and the act of photography with a violent crime, is so ridiculous it does not even deserve to be discussed.  She has no idea waht she is talking about+books
Pretty good read. Leaves out lots of the details.+P+I like the overall point of this book. I also agree with a lot of the stuff he teaches in regards to using real estate and owning your own business as the only true way to get superb rates of returns. However, he does make one huge assumption in the real estate section that is not clear: that you can rent a house for the same cost as your expenses. This may work in some cheaper areas, but in the places where houses have skyrocketed in price, expecting to get a high enough rent to cover all the fees is not realistic for some major areas. Also, he makes it sound like getting 150k is easy for a salary. Unfortunately for those of us in stable "normal" fields like engineering, nursing, accounting, etc... asking for a 30% raise would get you a lot of laughs at best. Nonetheless, I would still recommend it to other new grads+books
Was she really that GOOD of a mother?+N+I don't feel that Miller made much of an attempt to prove that Anna was in fact a "good" mother. Like another reviewer said, I don't think she was a BAD mother, but the book really didn't go into much detail about Anna's relationship with Molly (especially up until Anna' ex-husband filed for custody) and instead focused on Anna's life experiences and psyche. After Brian said he wouldn't send Molly back, Anna didn't even seem that concerned about Molly's mental and emotional well-being. She just focused on her notion that Leo's actions were simply taken out of context, and while she wanted to see Molly again, I got the impression that it was based on a selfish concern for her "rights" as a mother, not out of a concern for her daughter.   And what was so great about Leo anyway?? He wasn't exactly nice to Anna, often condescending to her, and from the beginning I felt that his affection for Molly was a farse, simply to stay on Anna's good side. He also seemed sexually possessive of Anna--like the scene when he kept having sex with her after Molly came into the bed because of a nightmare. I think Anna loved her daughter, but she made the error of confusing sexual attraction with true love, since she had never felt such an attraction before. As a result, her daughter became an afterthought to someone she had known for 2 months, with dire consequences. Although she did show some signs of remorse, she spent a large amount of time trying to justify her actions instead of showing a very deep concern for her daughter's welfare. If she had put her daughter first from the beginning, instead of being swept up into a sexual frenzy and creating illusions about the new "family" she and Leo were forming, then she probably never would have lost custody of her child.+books
He really thinks himself sincere, but his ego keeps getting in the way!+N+I really did love his collaboration with Deepak on Living Beyond Miracles, but I am beginning to grow tired of hearing the same stuff. If you want original and someone who is a gifted writer and humble man, Deepak is so much more of a deep thinker. I get really tired of hearing Wayne regurgitate other people's work. It is as if he doesn't have an original thought without quoting someone else's work.  And when he told the audience thank you for him being able to buy a house on Maui, I was actually a little bit offended in that I felt sorry for the audience. (I saw this on PBS) At first, they laughed and then they actually looked sad after he said it. I have heard him do this in every single audio work I have listened to in some way or another, and it is truly full of the ego he tells us to get away from.  I know we're all human, but there always seems to be a sting in his work that shows how big his head really is. Too bad! Without it, he could change so many more people's lives+books
These Bleachers are HARD!+N+I was very disappointed in this selection.  Maybe a MALE football fanatic would find something appealing, but I was VERY bored!  Take me back to court, to the lawyer's office, to the judge's chambers,...just about anywhere but these bleachers!!+books
Crisis? +N+As ever, Jimmy Carter attempts to lecture on morality. I thought he better start worrying about his own. When it comes to this, perhaps he should be the last man to turn to for guidance, judging by his not so exemplary performance over the years+books

Complaint - poor quality+N+The book I received appears a very cheap copy of the original book. There is no ISBN and copyright page, even the cover appears a cheap colour photocopy. What's the story?? You pay $20 for a book you expect to get a quality printed book. It mentions that it is published by Harper Collins though I am unable to find any reference to it on their website. I believe Amazon and/or the author owe buyers an explanation+books
Claire Messud is no Tom Wolfe+N+By setting her story in Manhattan, among the literary elite, Claire Messud might have imagined she was giving her readers an updated version of Tom Wolfe's "Bonfire of the Vanities," which described upper-class life in Manhattan among the Wall Street elite, so exquisitely that character descriptions from his 1987 book ("master of the universe" and "social skeleton") became part of our vocabulary.   Claire Messud is no Tom Wolfe. "The Emperor's Children" describes a circle of ambitious young adults who alternately worship and plot the overthrow of "The Emperor," a famous writer.  Unlike "Bonfire of the Vanities," this book has no compelling narrative - the "voice" shifts from one character to the next and the story ambles along as these young adults try to figure out what they want, who they need and who they love or hate and why.  Trust me, you won't care.  Meanwhile, the "Emperor" lopes along as a literary lion past his prime.  The characters become entangled in a mess of betrayals (the "Emperor" betrays his wife with his daughter's best friend, the daughter betrays her father by marrying the man who would dethrone the "Emperor" etc. etc.) -- and all the mess just goes away after the attacks on September 11, 2001.  But we never learn how September 11 affected Messud's characters - she uses that fateful day as an excuse to bring the curtain down on this stupid story going nowhere.    +books
A tragedy indeed....+N+"The Last River - The Tragic Race for Shangri-la".......Tragic. Yes I'd agree that this book is tragic. Tragic that I bothered reading it.....tragic that I paid for it in order to read it.....tragic that Todd wasted his time writing it......tragic that I disliked it so much that I can be bothered writing a review. The warning should have come upon examination of the back of the dust jacket. "Advance praise for The Last River" it reads. In retrospect this means no one is prepared to recommend the book after they have read it. It seems that Todd had a vision of how big a book needs to be, and went to great lengths to flesh out the story to reach his goal. So much of the content has so little relevancy to the story, that you soon tire trawling through it. This was my third Tsango experience. I do recommend the Outside documentary on the Lindgren expedition. "Hell or High Water" is not outstanding, but is worth a read, but on this book, my advise to Todd is please make this the Last River that you drag through the wringer+books
Uneven but still worth reading+P+First the good news. This book contains some of Heinlein's most interesting speculations, some of his most delightfully outlandish ideas (there is a cat who really can dematerialize and walk through walls, and enough skewed gender politics and sexual antics to give the book an X rating :-)), some of his most interesting characters (several of them new, and many old, such as Lazarus Long and Jubal Harshaw), and probably the most well developed presentation of the concept of The World As Myth. Heinlein uses this idea to tie together the different books, such as Glory Road, Stranger in a Strange Land, and The Number of the Beast, that are not a part of his Future History Series, by making them all members of the multiple timeline universe, or multiverse theory, that was discovered by mathematician Dr. Jake Burroughs in The Number of the Beast. It's a brilliant concept that unifies Heinlein's entire oeuvre under one integrating theory of temporal reality.  Now the bad news. The novel is very uneven and much of the action doesn't seem to go anywhere, as Dr. Ames and Hilda get chased from pressure dome to pressure dome on Luna, finally ending up at Time Corps Headquarters in another millenium. Even worse, the ending is possibly the most unsatisfactory of any Heinlein novel as it leaves the entire novel's story and denouement unfinished, perhaps because Heinlein intended to follow the book up with another novel. But as that never happened here it just ends in the middle of the action and there is nothing more to indicate how the story actually ends.   Half way through the book, it takes off in an unexpected direction (although that's part of the fun, since that's where you get to meet all the other characters from past novels), and is where one finally learns that this novel is subsumed under Heinlein's Temporal Multiverse concept. Still, there is little to motivate that based on the previous direction of the book. The hard-hitting, in your face, ultra-cool, smarter-than-you dialog that is one of Heinlein's trademarks, is so ubiquitous in the book so as to make it impossible to distinguish many secondary character's personalities from one another, as they all act and talk and think the same way--which is basically how Gwen Novak and Dr. Richard Ames behave too.   Finally, almost everyone in the book is apparently a completely larcenous, opportunistic, and immoral entrepreneur who would sell his own grandmother to the glue factory if he could get away with it, especially the citizens of Luna, who are proudly anarchistic, and who ardently believe that there ain't no such thing as a free lunch. But apparently that means it's okay to steal someone else's lunch if you can get away with it. After awhile this never ending procession of unrepentent and ebullient scalawags, rogues, and profiteers gets to be a little tedious, and seems to indicate a darkening of Heinlein's views on human nature which first became evident in his novel, Friday.  The novel is still well worth reading for Heinlein fans, but only if you're familiar with many previous characters, concepts, and history from earlier works. At a minimum, this would include Methuselah's Children, The Green Hills of Earth, The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress, Stranger in a Strange Land, The Number of the Beast, Glory Road, and possibly a few more that I'm forgetting. So if you're a newcomer to Heinlein, don't start with this book; start with the many better introductions to his fiction, such as those recommended on several websites developed to his work. If you do a Google Search on his name, you'll turn up several of these. The book assumes too much previous special knowledge to be comprehensible to the Heinlein beginner, and reading this one could turn someone off who might otherwise enjoy Heinlein with a little more knowledge and education.  All that having been said, the book is still worth reading, especially for Heinlein fans, since in this novel Heinlein fully develops the theory of The World As Myth that he introduced in The Number of the Beast. Another strong point, for all those Lazarus Long fans, is that Lazarus has a major role. And in the last part of the book, some of Heinlein's most memorable characters from previous books, such as Jubal Harshaw, Slipstick Libby, Mannie Davis, Rufus and Star (from Glory Road) Hazel Stone, Jake Burroughs, and others appear, and it's fun to have all of them in one place at Temporal Headquarters interacting together+books
Wish I Hadn't Bothered+N+If I could have given this book no stars I would have.  It was a complete waste of money and time.  Ms. Bacall comes across as a sour, shrewish old woman.  I don't know why actors think their political opinions are the ones we should all have.  Her disdain for her fellow Americans and our President lost her this former fan.  I've read my last book by Bacall+books
Great story in context+P+This is a great story in context - the year is 2002, the author is switching from being a hedge fund manager to a full-time journalist and TV prognosticator.  He's a branding machine, so the book contains a lot of self-promotion.  You see Jim the Hyper, Jim the Genius and Jim the Buffoon - all part of the brand.  The biography takes you from Jim at Harvard, to Jim the homeless journalist to Jim the financier to Jim the Hedge Fund operator.  Jim fesses up to a lot of the personal problems that he caused for himself along the way, writing in the same style he rants on TV.  As such, the story carries the same fast pace as the TV.  Even if you don't like him, you'll keep reading.   Is this a book on how to make $ in the stock market?  Not really - there are much better out there.  Is this the definitive biography on Cramer?  That probably won't be written until after his lact act.  Will this help you understand the guy sweating, screaming and pulling his hair out in the lightning round?  Absolutely+books
Offensive, 'blame the victim' tripe+N+So ... I now learn that the infertility problems I had for many years, which I always thought were due to polycystic ovaries and failure to ovulate were ACTUALLY due to the fact that I hate my husband, didn't want to have children with him or was simply ambivilent about motherhood. And my rather lengthy (but normal) labor was also due soley to my ambivilence about motherhood. And, presumably, any peronality quirks my daughter might have are due to some oddity about my labor and her birth, as Dr. Northrup's daughter's problems are mostly attributable to a 'too fast' second stage because she had pitocin.   There is some good stuff here, and it's certainly good for a woman to educate herself about her body, so she can avoid AVOIDABLE problems and understand what is normal, and find medical caregivers that fit her needs ... but so much of the book is based on the idea that almost anything that goes wrong is due to 'wrong thinking' (and conversely, if you just think (and behave ... mostly through an all natural,  mostly vegetarian, dairy-free, caffeine-free, alcohol-free, and sugarfree diet) properly, nothing will ever go wrong. +books
boring+N+The book is narated in a rather monotone, unethusiastic manner. It seems to be filled with Colin just narrating a chronological list of things he did with no insight into what these things meant or why he did them.+books
LIES, DAMNED LIES, AND STATISTICS+N+It was Mark Twain who popularized the aphorism of Benjamin Disraeli that there are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.  I kept hearing all these marvelous things about FREAKONOMICS, a book by Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner, so when I ran across it at 25% off, I did a stupid freakin' thing and bought it.  I thought, What the freak, I've got a pretty inquisitive mind and I'm open to seeing things differently, to discovering new viewpoints.  The doubt started early when I got the book home and I first noticed the glowing comments on the dust jacket from the likes of Time, The New York Times, The Washington Post, and The Los Angeles Times.  When all of the liberal news agencies are lining up to tell me how wondrous a certain publication is, I'm immediately going to be freakin' suspicious.  Author Malcolm Gladwell tells us on the cover, "Prepare to be dazzled."  Well, evidently Ol' Malcolm is dazzled a whole lot easier than I am.  (I won't even mention the smug mug of Stephen Dubner that taunted me from the book's dust jacket because I don't want you to get the idea that I judge a book by its cover.  Or in this case, a writer by his physiognomy.  So I won't mention that.)  If you're the kind of person who is amazed to learn that 70% of auto accidents occur within 10 miles of a driver's home, then you just MIGHT be dazzled by FREAKONOMICS.  If I tell you that the company that issues its 5-day-a-week employees only 3 uniform shirts, thinking that it is cutting costs, is probably increasing its overhead, and this fact astounds you  - if you must ask "But how?" - then yes, buy FREAKONOMICS and be dazzled.  Mostly what FREAKONOMICS offers (when its conclusions can be trusted) is just what we used to call "common sense."  But since America has been reduced to a bunch of corpulent, brain-dead zombies staring vacuously at that box of SURVIVORS, and AMERICAN IDOLS, and LOST knuckleheads, good old-fashioned common sense now appears to dazzle the dead (when you can sever them from that box and put a real book in their hands, that is).  I dove into FREAKONOMICS hoping to find my purchase worthwhile.  I got no further than page 13 when my fears were realized: everything would require second-guessing and verifying.  On that page, Smug Mug tells us (based on a single report by the Institute Of Medicine) that "drinking eight glasses of water a day has never actually been shown to do a thing for your health."  Fortunately, I read YOUR BODY'S MANY CRIES FOR WATER by Doctor F. Batmanghelidj over a decade ago so I already knew what a bunch of bunk that was.  In chapter 4, Smug Mug "proves" that legalizing abortion in 1973 with the Roe v. Wade decision was responsible for a national drop in the crime rate.  This represents the centerpiece of his book, both literally and ideologically.  The first thing the reader must accept is that there really has been a significant drop in crime since the early 1990s.  On page 92, the author acknowledges that the police in Atlanta were discovered to be underreporting crime in the early `90s in hopes of landing the 1996 Olympics.  Well, would police forces nationally have an incentive to underreport crime generally if it has actually dramatically increased since the `90s as predicted?  True, being honest might be means to an increased budget, but it sure would make your department appear inept and unable to maintain control.  And surely the Chamber Of Commerce and the big business interests would frown on that public perception.  Let me ask, do YOU actually feel you're less likely to be the victim of a crime now than you did in the early 1990s?  That's funny, me neither.  There's so much crime now that some of what was once reported to the police agencies goes unreported, and recently, an ex-police officer friend told me that cops can no longer engage in some of the micro-policing they were able to do in the `80s and `90s because crime is so out-of-control now.  In dismissing other possible factors responsible for the huge drop in crime (if this claim is a verity), Dubner states that increased police personnel accounts for only 10% of the drop.  Having a bit more insight into the nature of police work than does the average civilian, it's funny that I find myself even contending with the stats Smug Mug uses that actually WORK AGAINST his theory: I believe the wide-scale hiring of police officers since the early `90s could have impacted the crime rate only minimally - less than the 10% - while actually increasing the municipal coffers via traffic citations significantly.  And Dubner concludes that right-to-carry firearm laws "simply don't bring down crime."  (Be sure to read the utterly fascinating book, GUNFIGHTERS, HIGHWAYMEN & VIGILANTES by Roger D. McGrath, for a decidedly different and scholarly viewpoint!)  In dismissing all explanations for the unexpected drop in crime except legalized abortion, I didn't notice any mention of the tremendous increase in homeschooling and the proliferation of private schools since the early `90s, and I wonder if that might have some statistical bearing.  Ya think?   Yes, I think Smug Mug is selective.  He calls some abortions a "crude and drastic sort of insurance policy."  Not "immoral."  Not "sinful."  But then I didn't expect Smug Mug to call a sin a sin.    And even if Levitt and Dubner's hypothesis is correct, that abortions have lowered crime, the fact remains that not every aborted child would have eventually murdered an innocent person, but every aborted child was an innocent person murdered.  So why are we even discussing this?  I'll tell you why: because the pro-choice folks can feel a slightly shifting consensus, and now they're pulling out all the stops, trying to "statistically" convince the masses that they're safer with all those unborn potential criminals missing.  I find this repulsive!  (And there are studies indicating that those missing people have, and will continue to have, a negative economic impact on society.)  I won't even go into chapter 5, What Makes A Perfect Parent?  Suffice to say that as usual (surprise! surprise!) all the statistics Dubner employs nearly always seem to confirm the rightness of the liberal dogma on each issue.  Funny how those crunched numbers always crunch conservative beliefs.  Just know that if you're a working mother, you haven't cheated your child in the least, but if you're a dad who thinks that an occasional spanking is in order, you are "unenlightened."  If your kid is watching lots of TV, it isn't turning the "child's brain to mush."  (No word on whether or not it's turning his/her morals to mush though.)  And the studies (that we are called to pay attention to) show "that a child's character wasn't much affected whether or not he was sent to day care, whether he had one parent or two, whether his mother worked or didn't, whether he had two mommies or two daddies or one of each."  (I've often wondered what might have happened to me if my Mom, who was home most of the time, hadn't been there to hammer the dangers of drugs into my head day after day, year after year, while I was growing up in the `60s and `70s.)  I've given FREAKONOMICS two stars because I did find the section on the naming of children very interesting, as well as the story of Stetson Kennedy's fight against the "three Ks."  But if you're smarter than I am, you'll borrow this book from your library rather than paying money for it.  Economically speaking, that's just "common cents."+books
The best of them all!+P+I was having alot of problems and none of the several doctors and one specialist I tried knew what to do with me.  I bought several thyroid books, but this one answered all of my questions.  The author is eminently qualified to write this book, and has done so in a readable and down to earth, yet detailed way.  Thyroid problems can affect every aspect of your life in ways you might not imagine--you need to be well informed and this book will do it+books
Straight from two of the manufacturers+N+This is by far the most useless book on the subject of the state of education.  For instance, while the authors make much of the relative stability of SAT scores, they ignore the decline in scores from the NAEP, CTBS, and MAT scores (to name a few) from the same period.  They also keep silent about the fact that calculators were once forbidden from the math portion of the SAT, playing a role no doubt in said stability.  Dr. Lawrence Stedman, an Associate Professor of Education at the State University of New York at Binghamton, Ph.D. in Educational Policy Studies, and self-decribed progressive &quot;sympathetic to their concerns,&quot; wrote an article in the PEER-REVIEWED Education Policy Analysis Archives. He pointed out numerous examples of the fudging-- whether out of duplicity or incompetence, you judge-- of &quot;facts&quot; to support the authors' farcical claims, and where such claims went unsupported. In other words, while criticism usually comes from &quot;the enemy,&quot; ONE OF THEIR OWN blasted this book for its inaccuracies.  Since it could not possibly have been written with a straight face, I recommend spending your money on something written with more integrity.  There IS a real crisis in education, there ARE manufacturers, and this book rolled straight off their assembly line+books
Disapointment+N+As a PMP and member of a new PMO attempting to establish the value and credibility of a PMO within our organization I found this book to be a bitter disapointment. This book was singularly lacking in practical advice as the to implementation of a PMO. Regarding the subject matter, there was nothing "Advanced" about this book at all+books
argh+N+Very underwhelming. If you knew *nothing*, this might be a mediocre starting point, but there are so many other great resources on thyroid disease.  You deserve better than this book.  Like is short.   "Thyroid Power" or "Fat, Fuzzy, or Frazzled", Mary Shomon's books and similar books are *crammed* with helpful scientific information.  Also "Mood cure" is a great book worth checking out.+books
Apart from one scene scaring me, I loved this movie.+P+The first time I saw this movie, there was one scene which scared me; the scene where Mary's parents are dying from the plague (I think it was cholera?). The music they use for this can send chills down someone's back; I know because it did mine.  Apart from that, I loved the movie. I don't know why they had to have Dickon killed, though. (Ben Weatherstaff and Mary talk at the end of the movie; we find out that Dickon was killed in the war.)  I like how Colin and Mary meet at the end and how Mary held off on saying yes to Colin's marriage proposal until they were together in the garden.   Something else I'm wondering: Was this movie set during World War 1 or World War 2?+books
Fascinating+P+I have always been fascinated with Dr. King as one of the most influential leaders of the 20th century. I love the work that Dr. Dyson did in writing this book, because he is authentic in talking about Dr. King the man - strengths, weaknesses and all - while exposing the myths about him. Being African-American, I can understand why many within our community woud want to scold Dr. Dyson for exposing Dr. King's dirty laundry. I, however, consider it not only essential, but relevant that we talk about the true humanity of our leaders (espcially one as esteemed as Dr. King) to avoid the danger of us elevating them as idols. It is a great reminder that God uses people (albeit flawed people) for magnificent works in a fallen world. This is a great book that I highly recommed!+books
Sophisticated alternatives, indeed!+P+Finally, a reference book that offers its users more sophisticated word choices in a format that makes such inherent sense!  Peter Meltzer's book stands out in the way that he differentiates his thesaurus from other, heretofore, conventional ones.  The Rogets of the world, as Meltzer states, "start out with the premise that the user already knows the synonyms," and their guidebooks merely help to "jog his or her memory."  Meltzer's book provides its users with new, sophisticated synonyms which, importantly, are neither archaic nor obsolete.  In fact, nearly every synonym is followed by an example of its usage that is taken from actual articles or books, which is fascinating.  Additionally, Meltzer offers what he calls "clarifiers" to 75% of his entries.  These clarifiers amplify the single word you may be seeking.  For example, there are seven uses for "unusual," each with its own specific synonym that more aptly describes "unusual", as in unusual/unconventional, unusual/supernatural, unusual/person, etc.  Don't expect to find the simple synonyms that you're used to seeing in other thesauri.  Meltzer gives you the benefit of the doubt that you already know those words and offers you a more exciting, more intelligent way to shape your vocabulary.  Regardless of your writing needs, this book is a must-have.  I enjoyed reading the introduction, it gave me a strong sense of  the book's layout and reminded me why a thesaurus is not just for writing college term papers+books
What good there is undermined by bigotry+N+Though Mr. Steyn does have strong opinions and some good observations, his judgements are tainted by an anti-gay bias (he titles one chapter "The Fags", and it's not meant affectionately).  His readings of stories such as the reaction of Lorenz Hart upon hearing "Oklahoma" in a blackout could have been better informed by further research, and he repeats Lerner's silly comment about Lorenz Hart being to short to be heterosexual so he had to turn to men.  The book is also dated in many respects including the waning influence of British Operettas and the public's acceptance of Stephen Sondheim.  Rather than this book I would reccommend anything by Ethan Mordden or Martin Gottfried+books
It's a CRIME that this book is still for sale.+N+The publishers should be sued. Maybe we should get a class-action together.  Imagine taking an instruction manual for the very first Apple computer and putting a new title on it "How to use your new home computer" and selling it in bookstores today. This book is doing EXACTLY that!  Also, it is highly doubtful that the tactic ever worked in the first place. The author's website vanished years ago. In a thinly traded NYSE stock if you try to repeatedly front the specialist with 2000 share orders he will simply move the price 50 cents against you immediately following your next purchase. Game over.  [...+books

loose sprockets on cassettes+N+I was disappointed with my purchase.   The first two tapes in the series were fine, but when I inserted the 3rd tape into my machine the tape started feeding out the front of the machine.  I checked the tape and the wheels or sprockets they were wound on were loose and free floating inside the plastic casing.  I, then examined the other remaining cassettes and 4 of the 8 had the same problem.  I wonder if these products were seconds or something?  I would not order from this vendor again because it could have ruined my machine and because it is a hassle to have to return merchandise in today's busy work world. +books
Be careful when reading this book+N+I am not a neurologist but have a strong personal interest in epilepsy. I read this book with great care. There are many chapters of significant merit including chapters 10-20. These chapters include the seizure taming effects of relaxation and certain types of music, doing things to prevent seizure progression when an aura is felt, lots of general information on epilepsy that is organized on a gender or age basis, the challenges of finding employment, and advice on a whole host of life issues that people with epilepsy often face. These are even more thoroughly covered in a number of other references which I have also read that come from the medical community.   So here is the real issue; what is in chapters 1-9? These chapters are loaded with information on diet, food supplements, vitamins, minerals, oriental medicine and other alternative and complementary approaches to treating epilepsy. As I read the Forward by Russell Blaylock MD and chapters 1-9 I had a growing sense that the author's thesis or belief is that traditional American medical treatment of epilepsy on the whole may do more harm than good and should be avoided if possible and that the natural approach is without risk and should be used preferentially. The real problem with this philosophy is that there are many people out there that will believe such nonsense. Any natural approach has risks as well as possible (if unproven) benefits. I certainly do not want to deny that there are problems associated with traditional medical treatment of epilepsy. Side effects are a real issue and can not be ignored.  The book has many unsubstantiated assertions that would make people think that the medical profession as a whole is uninformed. That is most unfortunate. Here is one example from the Forward;   ("Doctors in general have difficulty with biochemistry in medical school......If your doctors do not understand these molecular events how can they efficiently treat your disorder? In addition to this lack of knowledge......" p. iv   Chapter 1 is a testimonial by the author on how she dealt with her epilepsy by eliminating junk food from her diet, switching to wholesome foods, adding herbs to the mix (skullcap and goldenseal), exercising and losing weight. She also decreased the amount of Phenobarbital she was taking. At that point she endorses a definition of drugs as being "poison(s)." The reader is also introduced to Robert Fried Ph.D. (a neuropsychologist?) Dr. Fried allegedly has come to the conclusion that "Seizures are metabolical, (sic) not neurological." Dr. Fried also allegedly feels that seizures are more like a regulatory body-process, like vomiting, rather than a disease process. The seizures are, allegedly according to the author, in a way readjusting the individual's metabolism to attempt to achieve homeostasis. My understanding is that there are some seizures that have a metabolic origin but they are in the minority. Certainly eating better and taking care of one's body should make a difference in overall health. Whether that will cure epilepsy is far from proven.   Chapter 4 starts by stating that if you have seizures it is imperative that you see a physician. That is good advice. An implication is made that hypoglycemia may be a major cause of seizures. Such an assertion ("major cause")is a little bit irresponsible in my opinion. It is correctly pointed out that anticonvulsants can have long-term adverse effects on calcium metabolism and bone health. It is then pointed out that phenytoin (an increasingly infrequently used old line anticonvulsant) contains "Drano" and "antifreeze." Puleeeze give us a break.  Most readers should know better than to believe that. The real problem with this book as I see it is that there are people out there that will actually believe these assertions that are thrown in for effect, and may avoid the medical profession and thus deny themselves of the benefits that modern medical science has to offer. I in fact know of one mother that read this book four years ago and then took her daughter off of her medication feeling that it was too toxic to tolerate. The daughter's seizures that had been completely controlled for 9 months returned after 3 weeks and have never been under good control since then, in spite of restarting and then trying other medications. A reference should have been included, to the important studies that show that people that achieve complete control on medication for at least 2 or 4 years, have a high likelihood (better than 50/50) of not needing medications after that point, but that those that go off medication early and relapse are often difficult to control. On the whole this book is not balanced and this is one example where the other side of the picture should have been presented.   Chapter 5 on nutrition is interesting and useful. It is smart to eat right.   A lot of chapter 6, "Foods that Harm" makes sense.   Chapter 7 "Foods that Heal" has some interesting ideas. There is information on food supplements as well. I think a more scientific approach to the use of food supplements could have been taken. The issue of the blood brain barrier is not dealt with. There are many unsubstantiated assertions in this chapter. The section on GABA is a good example of both of these problems. GABA does not cross the blood brain barrier and so orally ingested GABA will not end up in the central nervous system. The section ends by stating that "daily supplementation of 500 to 1,000 mg of GABA has been shown to help prevent seizures." This is an irresponsible statement, that if taken and followed, could cost the individual several hundred dollars a year, and all for naught.   Chapter 8 is about the Ketogenic Diet. Although it can help in those with seizures that are particularly difficult to control, I think that most neurologists would not routinely recommend it. The chapter fails to point out the downside of the ketogenic diet and fails to point out that it will not work unless the patient is truly ketotic. Adding fats to a regular diet to try and achieve some of the benefits of the ketogenic diet will only result in weight gain, elevated serum cholesterol and triglycerides, and possibly exacerbation of seizures. Studies have shown that simply losing weight correlates with better seizure control.   Chapter 9 on herbs is interesting but readers should look to other sources before investing a small fortune on those options. A recent book by Orrin Devinsky, MD takes a critical look at herbs (and other alternative and complementary methods of approaching epilepsy) and cites relevant scientific literature (if it exists) that confirms the value of various herbs.  On the whole I do not feel that this is a balanced book. Nor do I feel that the author intended for it to be a balanced book. The sources cited as experts are too dominated by acquaintances of the author and not enough is cited from peer review scientific literature. There are far too many unsubstantiated assertions. Actually following some of the advice in the book could lead to lost opportunities to get epilepsy under control and could lead to much expense in search of the often elusive goal of effectively treating epilepsy without medication. I cannot recommend this book. I can recommend Dr. Devinsky's book "Complementary and Alternative Therapies for Epilepsy."  It is a bit pricy so I recommend borrowing it from your local library unless you are a physician or a hopeless book collector that likes to buy medical texts. I give this book 2 stars because it does have some useful information. The other stuff unfortunately brings it down to a "2." +books
Controversial but naive +N+Robert A. Heinleins novel "Starship Troopers" still creates controversy, generations after it was first published. Indeed, the well-known movie "Starship Troopers" was actually a veiled criticism of the book!   Is Heinlein's book racist or fascist? Is it a Cold War allegory? Is it anti-democratic and militarist? How does this novel square with Heinlein's reputation for being a libertarian and near-hippie? These questions are still being hotly debated.   "Starship Troopers" describe a future society in which only people who have served in the military enjoy full citizenship rights. Only honorably discharged soldiers have the right to vote and run for office. Strangely enough, the non-citizens enjoy freedom of speech, freedom of worship and the right to start businesses. Heinlein's future society thus looks like modern America, but with a Marine Corps-like military caste superimposed on top. In the novel, humanity wages a never-ending war against several races of intelligent space aliens, including the collectivist Arachnids, who resemble spiders. Many people take the Arachnids to be a symbol for Communism in general or Red China in particular. Imperial Japan is another possibility.   Heinlein's novel attempts to solve that ancient question: how can a society make sure that the best people serve in office? This question is particularly acute in democracies, where anyone can stand for office, and everyone can vote. Heinlein's solution is to limit the franchise to those who have served in the military. In this way, only the best are selected for the job. And those willing to put their lives on the line must be the best. But does that really solve the problem?   A military is not necessarily a good administrator or politician. The best in times of peace might be different from the best in times of war. Heinlein's system only works if a total and never-ending war is raging. Indeed, the war against the Arachnids certainly seem to be such. But if so, it's naive to expect freedom of speech or extensive rights for non-citizens. The system would become a military dictatorship pure and simple, like in the movie "Starship Troopers".   The soldiers in the novel are probably inspired by the philosopher-kings and Guardians of Plato's "Republic". After rigorous military training, the officers are given courses in moral philosophy, history and politics. But there are also similiarities with ancient Athenian democracy. Every citizen of ancient Athens was expected to serve in the army or navy. There was a connection between rights and duties. But note that many non-citizens in Athens were slaves!   Ultimately, "Starship Troopers" is unconvincing, even naive. You simply cannot give political power to the military, no matter how the military is recruited, and expect everything else to stay the same. +books
Anti-American Screed Offensive+N+I found this book to be offensively un-American.  The characters accuse our country and our government of all sorts of nefarious acts.  The best spy thriller fiction is based on fictional characters and actions in a world not totally removed from reality not an agenda of false premises.  I think the author is the real conspiracy theorist not the characters.+books
An excellent collection...+P+Just in case you had any doubts, this collection of essays (dating from 1968 to 1999) is clearly a major archive of achievement, demonstrating Stroud's preminence in American philosophy. Here is his articles in epistemology, which touch upon various topics: foundationialism, scepticism, and transcendental arguments. Stroud pays close attention to the challenges philosophical scepticism offers any theory of knowledge, and highlights just how skepticism is a serious problem in contemporary philosophy.  He is also careful to argue for the &quot;invulnerability&quot; of certain thoughts and experiences+books
How much of it is useful ???+N+I took two days and went through the book. Sounds more like  R&D book rather than something which I am going to use. If you want to learn good SQL tuning, stick with Guy Harrison - it is more practical+books
Touching Story+P+I had seen a few TV movie adaptations of Danielle Steel's novels but never got the time to reading any of her books. So I finally decide to get `The Gift', seeing that it would be a short read, just to give her books a try. I must say that I loved reading this book, and have already bought other books of hers to add to my bookshelf.  5 year old Annie Whittaker died of meningitis, the day after Christmas, leaving a bruise on the rest of the family: Tommy, her brother; Elizabeth, her mother; and John, her father. Each member of the family slowly secludes themselves from one another in their own way. What used to be a close knit family doesn't exist now. Meanwhile, we are introduced to Maribeth Robertson, a 16 year old girl who makes a mistake that would change her life. She runs away from her family and friends, and starts working in a restaurant as a waitress, where she meets Tommy. The two immediately hit it off, but there are a lot of problems standing in their way which they must face.  The story is very sweet, and we get to read how Maribeth changes the Whittakers and makes them a family again. Though the ending is a little sad, you feel touched by the story overall. Danielle Steel, famous of writing matters of the heart, does an excellent job in depicting the love between two lovers, between a mother and a daughter, and the love within the family.   Whether you are a fan of Danielle Steel or not, if you like reading romantic novels, then this book will be a perfect `gift' for you+books

An interesting mix of good and bad.+N+Im not really writing this review to sway anyone's opinion of it.  Tastes are different from person to person.  Some may love this book, others may hate it, and a few will think its okay, that is just the way things are.  I only wanted to share my opinion about it, because oddly enough it stirs up strong emotions within me whenever I think about it. The first time i read this book I hated it.  I have read it again since then and upon finshing it twice I still don't like this book at all.  Yet, during both times that I read it I could not put the book down.  This is the bizarre duplicitous nature of The Relic.  I do not like the story or the characters, but still I have been drawn in.  As much as I hate to admit it I consider this book to be a real page-turner.    I don't think i need to go into the plot so I will list the offenses this book commits (once again this is just my opinion).  Predictability - I dont think I was surprised even once while reading this book.  It gives you the kind of cut and pasted characters that are far to overused these days.  From the first time a character is introduced you can pretty much tell whether they are in it for the long haul, or merely here to serve as entree's for the monster.  The outcome of most of the situations presented are easily deciphered if given any thought at all.  Not to spoil any surprises but I'll give you one guess what happens when we are informed that the museum the beast haunts has a security system with solid metal doors that fall into place to cut off a supposed thief's escape route.  Throw in the fact that we are informed of this right before a gala premier of the museums' new attraction in which hundreds of guests will be attending and...well I think you allready know where this is going.  Poor Characters -  All your cliche's are here.  From the overworked, underappreciated heroine, who puts all the pieces together, to the museums management staff who refuse to shut down the museums' premier even after numerous, grisly murders.  Why? do you ask.  Because of revenues of course. I wonder if the museums' head director wears the same suits as the mayor from the movie Jaws.  If the characters arent fulfilling the role as a needed cliche' then they are doing the exact opposite that any sane person would do.  If I heard strange noises in a closed section of the museum I was gaurding, especially after the fact that at least two horrific murders were commited in the vicinity, I would call for backup before I investigated.  Of course I am sane, so reverse what I would have done and you get the basic course of action most of the people in this book take.  UNBELIEVABILITY -  There were many times while reading this book when I had to stop and say, "Give me a break."  I also used the expressions, "Oh, please", and "That is so STUPID!".  Many times we are expected to deny common sense, and reason so that the story can progress.  Of course if you had a monster that could be killed like any other animal on this planet, then this book would probably only be 100 pages long.  So in an effort to stretch it out to 400 or so pages you need a creature that can be described as nothing short of the animal equivalent of a sherman tank.  Im not kidding, this monkey-lizard is shot no less than 5 times and probably a great deal more with no ill effects.  I don't want to give anything more away, but there will be many times when you will find something hard to believe in this book.  Many "What a rip-off" moments - To often while reading this book I found myself comparing it to some other book or movie that had come before it.  There is a reason so many people compare this book to Jurrasic Park, many plot points and supposed surprises seem to be taken right out of Chricton's book.  So instead of putting the quote "Far above Chricton's Jurassic Park" on the cover of The Relic, I would have put "Not above taking ideas from better books".  Put Jurrasic Park, Congo, and Jaws in a blender and you have The Relic. This "borrowing" of ideas seems so bad at times that I wouldnt be surprised if for every copy of The Relic sold Micheal Chricton received royalties.  Once again I feel compelled to mention that for all its stupidity, and predictability, I could not put this book down.  For that reason alone this book is probably worth reading, and sharing with your friends.  Then you can all sit down and compare notes on how many times you each found an instance where you found yourself thinking of another, probably better, book+books

Controversial but naive +N+Robert A. Heinleins novel "Starship Troopers" still creates controversy, generations after it was first published. Indeed, the well-known movie "Starship Troopers" was actually a veiled criticism of the book!   Is Heinlein's book racist or fascist? Is it a Cold War allegory? Is it anti-democratic and militarist? How does this novel square with Heinlein's reputation for being a libertarian and near-hippie? These questions are still being hotly debated.   "Starship Troopers" describe a future society in which only people who have served in the military enjoy full citizenship rights. Only honorably discharged soldiers have the right to vote and run for office. Strangely enough, the non-citizens enjoy freedom of speech, freedom of worship and the right to start businesses. Heinlein's future society thus looks like modern America, but with a Marine Corps-like military caste superimposed on top. In the novel, humanity wages a never-ending war against several races of intelligent space aliens, including the collectivist Arachnids, who resemble spiders. Many people take the Arachnids to be a symbol for Communism in general or Red China in particular. Imperial Japan is another possibility.   Heinlein's novel attempts to solve that ancient question: how can a society make sure that the best people serve in office? This question is particularly acute in democracies, where anyone can stand for office, and everyone can vote. Heinlein's solution is to limit the franchise to those who have served in the military. In this way, only the best are selected for the job. And those willing to put their lives on the line must be the best. But does that really solve the problem?   A military is not necessarily a good administrator or politician. The best in times of peace might be different from the best in times of war. Heinlein's system only works if a total and never-ending war is raging. Indeed, the war against the Arachnids certainly seem to be such. But if so, it's naive to expect freedom of speech or extensive rights for non-citizens. The system would become a military dictatorship pure and simple, like in the movie "Starship Troopers".   The soldiers in the novel are probably inspired by the philosopher-kings and Guardians of Plato's "Republic". After rigorous military training, the officers are given courses in moral philosophy, history and politics. But there are also similiarities with ancient Athenian democracy. Every citizen of ancient Athens was expected to serve in the army or navy. There was a connection between rights and duties. But note that many non-citizens in Athens were slaves!   Ultimately, "Starship Troopers" is unconvincing, even naive. You simply cannot give political power to the military, no matter how the military is recruited, and expect everything else to stay the same. +books
Around the World in Eighty Days+P+Around the World in Eighty Days, by Jules Verne, is a novel set in 1872, when technical revolutions allow a man to travel around the world in eighty days.  But, to all the members of the Reform Club but one, this is only correct theoretically.  However, to Mr. Phileas Fogg, this is a practical number.  He then wagers twenty thousand pounds that he can make the journey.  So Mr. Fogg and his newly acquired servant, Passepartout, immediately set out for their first stop- Suez.  There they encounter a detective named Fix, who has heard news of a robber that fits Mr. Fogg's description exactly.  Fix, wanting the reward of five percent of the fifty-five thousand pounds stolen, makes it his business to stop the `criminal' at all costs.  Fix, believing that the wager is just a ruse to get the cops off his tail, thinks that Mr. Fogg will not follow through with this journey around the world.  All goes smoothly, seeing as Fix is unable to attain a warrant for Mr. Fogg's arrest, until the railway that they are traveling on from Bombay to Calcutta, much to their surprise, is unfinished!  Fortunately, thanks to Mr. Fogg's cunning ways, the party is able to buy an elephant to travel the fifty miles to the next railway station.  On the way to the next railway station at Allahabad, they see a young woman being carried by Indian savages.  An acquaintance, Sir Francis, explains that she is going to be sacrificed.  Mr. Fogg, having gained twelve hours, decides to save the woman from a painful death.  Aouda, as it turns out, is royalty to a village in India.  But, since the savages will stop at nothing to find her, it becomes necessary to take her to her cousin in Hong Kong, which is conveniently one of the stops on Mr. Fogg's journey.  But, much to the party's dismay, the relative has moved to Europe.  Fix, hoping to delay the party, gets Passepartout knocked out on opium, keeping the valuable information that the Carnatic, the vessel from Hong Kong to Yokohama, is leaving that night instead of tomorrow morning.  However, to Aouda's sorrow, the party finds another privately owned boat to take them to Shanghai, leaving Passepartout behind.  The party decides to go to Shanghai because that's where the steamer to San Francisco starts, then stops at Yokohama and Nagaski, then departing for San Francisco.  Much to the party's delight, they find out that Passepartout actually did make it aboard the Carnatic before it left, and they had a reunion aboard the San Francisco steamer.  The steamer makes it into the San Francisco bay on the third of December, and Mr. Fogg has neither gained nor lost a day. The party then takes a rail passage from San Francisco to Ogden, only impeded by a herd of bison for three hours.  On the way from Ogden to Omaha, however, a band of Sioux Indians attacks the train.  Three passengers are captured, including Passepartout!    Mr. Fogg does his duty, and rescues Passepartout.  Fix, now having his best interests to get Mr. Fogg back to English soil as soon as possible, tells of a sledge that can be taken to the city of Omaha, where trains are plentiful.  They take the trains to New York without stoppage.  However, upon arriving at New York, they find out that the China, the steamer going to Liverpool, left only forty-five minutes beforehand!  Mr. Fogg's party is able to board a private boat, for two thousand pounds each.  He then `persuades' the crew to set sail for Liverpool.  A storm makes the crew resort to steam power only.  They run out of coal and have to burn the wooden parts of the ship, which Mr. Fogg buys off the owner for sixty thousand dollars.  They take a rail line from Queenstown to Liverpool, gaining twelve hours on the steamers.  The arrive in Liverpool at noon on the twenty-first, leaving only eight hours and forty-five minutes to get to the Reform Club.  But, much to Mr. Fogg's surprise, he is arrested by Fix.  But the thief had been caught three days before!  After a three-hour delay, they charter a train to London, where they arrive at 8:50-five minutes too late.  The next day, Mr. Fogg and Aouda decide to get married.  When Passepartout runs off to find a reverend, he learns that it's only the 21st instead of the 22nd!  Mr. Fogg arrives at the Reform Club at the preset time, winning his wager!  By traveling east, he had gained a day during his journey, allowing him to win his wager.  Jules Verne does a great job balancing facts and excitement in this novel.  He provides an exciting science-fiction story, while giving some great info on places around the world.  I enjoyed this book, and would recommend it to anyone with a sense of adventure, or whoever has dreamed about going around the world+books
Its really about common sense+N+This book was a waste of time to read.  It comes down to this,  eat sensibly and in moderation, exercise and the weight should come off.  If you only have 10 pounds to loose, I wouldn't recommend it.  It seems like this book is geared torwards people who have a lot of weight to loose.  If I followed this diet, I would be famished.  Eat when you hungry, why wait for the "miracle" three hour?  I just don't get it.  I think the book was also more about joining Jorge's website+books
Very misleading title. Reads like a boring technical manual+N+This book is analagous to buying a new elliptical, anxiously opening the user manual to find out how this new piece of equipment is going to benefit you,  only to find page after page outlining the technical details of the inner workings of the machine with the last sentence or so briefly mentioning the effects the machine can have on your life. The author is obviously an expert on the subject of astronomy and how it relates to ancient historical monuments, but he is so caught up in the technical details that "the transformation of our consciousness" is brushed aside as an afterthought. Instead, the author drones on and on and on about monuments, angles, precessions, measurements etc. It's obviously necessary to briefly cover the technical aspects to build a foundation for the more exciting stuff to come, but this book never builds on that foundation. There were brief moments when I thought the book started to get really interesting, but the author would quickly revert back to the same old empirical, newtonian shallowness with more chapters that should have been titled, "who gives a [...]." John Major Jenkins is not really interested in the metaphysical side of this subject, and if you don't believe me, I quote page 239 of this book..."as a reminder, my work is not really to identify a mechanism that could empirically explain why a solstice-galaxy alignment might have transformative effects for life on Earth." My question is then why mention the transformation of consciousness in the title when it's hardly mentioned in the book? You would think that the benfits and effects of the sun aligning with the galactic center is going to have on our consciousness would be the main focus, since after all, it's what most of us should be most concerned with. If you are preparing for a test in astronomy, this book is for you. 2 stars for the misleading title.+books
Pathetic+N+I bought this book while rushing through an airport terminal needing something to read on the plane.  Not one of my better decisions.  Very wordy, and the dialogue is so clipped and stilted it's totally absurd -- reminds me of the way the cops talked in "Dragnet."  We are talking zero development of characters.  Perhaps Mr. Woods feels he doesn't need to give any depth to characters that he's been writing about in previous books.  Well, he's wrong.  You basically just don't care about these people.  They aren't real, and they talk weird.  Not much action either, unless you count actions like:  they got in the car; they got in the boat; they got in the plane.  You get the picture.  This is another case of a well-known author throwing something together so he can get it on the newsstand and rob you of your money.  Don't fall into his trap like I did.  There are a lot better books out there.+books
Only Theoretically Good+N+There's a lot to like in this book, theoretically. The worlds themselves are well-drawn, the language curt and no-nonsense with occasional flights into a kind of hard cyberpunk beauty (that sort of mimics but doesn't really ever come close to the best that William Gibson has given us). The science is seamlessly integrated into the story, and you come away with the impression that a lot of thought went into its structure.  The theory doesn't hold, though. This just isn't a very good book.   The action follows three different characters, along three different threads. At first, and for most of the book, they have no obvious connection with each other. Their stories appear to unravel aimlessly, and although lots of stuff happens, none of it seems to be in the service of an actual story. It has the effect of three brutal picaresques without destinations, physical or moral.  There is a payoff, but it takes a long time to get there, and by the time I did I was so exhausted and dispirited by the intervening unpleasantness that it didn't really have much of an impact.  There are three major problems with this book:  Information withholding: I like books with central mysteries, that make you wait (and work) to understand what's going on. It's a good propulsive technique, plot-wise. But the mysteries need to resolve. The author keeps us confused pretty much the whole way through, dropping occasional hints that aren't so much tantalizing as frustrating. As I said: by the time I figured out what was going on, I'd stopped caring. This might just be my limitations as a reader, but I gather, from other reviews, that a lot of people feel the same way. You work so hard to understand what's going on that it's difficult to enjoy any of it.  Dreams: Harrison uses dreams both in the service of both theme and plot: to elucidate the characters' psychology, and to give us a window into their past. This is unfortunate, because (in my mind) dreams are lazy plot devices that give the author an excuse to stop the narrative and jump back for some convenient exposition, instead of wending it into the story. Generally speaking, as soon as I hit a dream sequence, I lose interest. I lost interest a lot in this book. Which is a shame, because the content of the dreams here is often wonderful, strange and sometimes even touching. It just needs to be presented better.  Unremitting dourness: There is nothing pleasant about reading this book. The main characters are either savage and unlikeable, pitiable and unlikeable, or mystifying and unlikeable. Often all three. And, with the exception of the wife (who I liked almost as much as I pitied), none of the supporting characters are much use either. The worlds they inhabit are brutal, dire, unpleasant, and dour. There's a lot of sex here, but as portrayed it's mostly just another kind of violence. The whole thing's kind of a downer, pretty much the whole way through, and the strange note of hope at the end comes off false and unconvincing, as if it's been grafted on from another, happier book.  The writing itself has some odd lapses too, given the care that went into the structure of the book, and the obvious attention to detail. Lots of tortured, passive sentences. A few bits of dialogue that sound like campy Chandler.   Harrison is obviously very talented. I wanted very much to like this book, and I suspect I'll pick up another one of his novels sometime in the future. There's a great deal of potential here. It's just that most of it went unrealized+books

A perfect example of King's boredom with writing+N+It took me less than a day and a half to read this book. And thats not because i was "glued to it" or "thought it was a real page-turner" but basically because it was a real fast read. However, this book, as i stated, is a perfect example of Stephen King's boredom with writing horror/fiction. His work within the last decade especially, has taken some well deserved criticism. Based on the concept that most of his recent books are churned out in a "cookie-cutter" method. Now, don't get me wrong, King is responsible for some of the most compelling stories ever. Stories that seem to transcend the "horror genre", and incorporate elements of mystery, romance, and drama. However, this is not one. I would rate this book only behind "Insomnia" as the most insipid King novels i've ever read. I don't know how to explain it to those who have not read most of King's work. But for those who have, it will make sense when i say that about a quarter of the way into the book, i found myself thinking "oh....it's going to be another one of THESE stories huh?" THESE meaning a really generic character, and a foreseeable "generic" villian, ultimately squaring off in a very "generic" ending. halfway through, i could already see how it was going to end. And this is one of those books where King's references to East coast culture are going to take precedence over the quality of the finished product. Some examples of King's finest work would be "The Talisman", "Night Shift"(THE best collection of short horror stories ever), The Shining, The "Dark Tower" sieries, and The Stand, just to name a few. And if you have not read any of "The Bachman books" (King as Bachman) "Rage", "The Long Walk", Road Work", and "The Running Man", are some of the most well written, and mind-bending stories ever told.  This, however, isn't. And unless you can purchase this book for under $2.00 don't waste your money, or your time.      +books
Thorough unbiased overview+P+I felt this was an excellent depiction of a broad section of world cultures. Great for providing a more thorough view of our world+books
Less Krav Maga+N+Started the book and put it down as I was not very interest in hearing the author's personal journey as I was interested in learning this style of self defense. The illustartions were too small and the exercise routine was left until chapter nine!!  I however feel that there will be some positives from reading the book+books
Enjoyed the book+P+When I first obtained Partners in Crime by J.A. Jance, I had no idea the story was taking place in Bisbee, in Cochise Co., Arizona, which only added delight to my reading enjoyment.  I lived in Sierra Vista which is also in Cochise Co. a few years ago, and I must say the descriptions were pretty much to the location. For me it was a step back in time. Which made it a 5 star for me.  I came in contact with sodium azide when my vehicle ran into a brick wall, which was a choking situation. Maybe it will serve a purpose if everyone would contact their state representatives about how the substance is being left in discarded vehicles.  It was refreshing to find a female sheriff in Bisbee, AZ, it being a macho town like so many of the border towns.  However Sheriff Joanna Brady does very well being a newcomer investigating a murdered Rochelle, who was in the witness protection program; a second murder, and having to share the investigation with Beaumont.  I enjoyed the mystery; it was a quick read with wonderful memories for me.+books
Why care about the future?+P+Postrel forces you to think explicitly about the future.  I have 10 children.  Thus I have more invested in the future than most people.  The future my children and grandchildren inherit and create be mostly shaped by people with dynamist views.  After all, it is the dynamists who created civilization.  To be sure, history is full of examples where the forces of stasis won over the dynamists, sometimes for centuries.  However, I think the future is with the dynamists.   I'm betting this book will be considered a seminal classic 100 years from now.+books
The elephant in the capitalist room+N+Let me see if I have got this right? The only way to organize the economy is the capitalist way? That way we all gain? OK the bosses of Nike, McDonalds, and Wal-Mart will gain a bit more than us ordinary folk, but our little boats will rise with the flowing tide?  Sounds good: who would want to be the party pooper?!  Well someone's got to be, and for the simple reason that we don't live on a planet the size of Jupiter.   The oil's finite: we know that but can't be bothered to act on it. Even the supply of water is turning out to be finite: the south east of England is on a collision course between an expanding population and a diminishing supply of water. OK, they could ship it in from the rest of the UK where there's no problem, but for reasons that don't quite add up that's not possible. It's not the corporate solution, if you will forgive the pun.  Has it occurred to anyone, I wonder, if it's capitalist-driven growth which is at the heart of the upcoming problems? Yes, I know Marx and Stalin don't offer any fixes, but at some point along the way the problem is going to have to be faced: growth is going to wind-down whether we like it or not. +books
Agree with "Lost in Translation"+N+I have loved each and every one of Jane Hamilton's other novels and highly recommend them:  The Book of Ruth, A Map of the World, Short History of a Prince and Disobedience.  This book, sadly, does not rank among them.  It feels forced and uninteresting, with outlandish and unrecognizable characters and scenarios.  I've already paid for it, so I'll probably try to finish it, but don't waste your time or money.  Read another Hamilton instead+books

How to not be a victim of circumstance+P+Mr. Gray spins quite a story of how he accomplished quite a bit at such a young age. His drive to better his situation, but more importantly help others, is very inspirational.

Great Title, But...+N+I'll admit it, the title got me. I probably read two business books a year, and this one didn't offer anything new. Most of it was new twists on the same old rules. It was not inspiring, motivating, or compelling+books
Swept Away+P+This is a book that really sweeps you away. Danielle Steel is such a talented writer, this book displays that talent at it's best.

Pompous, elitist crap+N+What a load of garbage.  Equating a camera with a gun and the act of photography with a violent crime, is so ridiculous it does not even deserve to be discussed.  She has no idea waht she is talking about+books
A Girl Named Zippy+P+The cover photo of an alert non-Gerber baby.  An old family photo topping each chapter.  These help set a whimsical tone skillfully followed through with words only a mother could love.  From tufted-head to stubbed-toe, this book celebrates the spunk of youth with countless recalls of which our inner tot can relate.   We could long for a Dad like hers--who loved his third child enough to casually coin her Zippy.  Through her eyes, this family doesn't take itself too seriously. How Zippy organizes and rationalizes daily undertakings is felt as youthful, reads as youthful.  The flightiness of friendships, unnerving nature of neighbors and natural distancing from parents are all taken in stride and delicately expressed.  She's a child with shameless pride in plainness.  Any precociousness is thankfully not odious.  This folk-child character seems too clever to be actual, too enlightened to be real, but we're more than happy to play along.   The book's subtle intrigue--all well told with a perception that belies its naï¿½ve charm.  Haven Kimmel has pulled off some retro-realism with finesse.  A delightful and amusing read. +books
Disgusting+N+The only book I've ever read that I tore up and threw in the trash when I was finished. If this passes for an uplifting magical fable then there's something seriously wrong with the world.This is a tragic, sad, grotesque, disturbing tale of a child so traumatized that he has to make up an alternate reality just to cope with the horror of the world. When a child is damaged it is never uplifting, whimsical or funny and anyone who finds it so better take a deep look into themselves and make some changes. This book is sickening. Don't buy it!!! There are no animals only pain and death+books
need more detail+N+I bought this book thinking it would be a more specicfic musculoskeletal companion to Braddom's generalized PM&R textbook. Unfortunately the treatment paragraphs (most important section from my perspective) for each topic were very thin and nonspecific.  They were woefully inadequate for an attending or physiatry resident.  I sent the book back which unfortunately meant I didn't get to critique the DVD. +books

Profiting from the Christian Man Shortage+N+There is no doubt in my mind that Josh Harris is a good person, who sincerely wants to help people, particularly young Christian women, who are especially affected by the vicissitudes of the modern dating scene. However, he doesn't seem to offer much honesty about why this book has been so popular.  Either he's guilelessly uninformed or deliberately avoidant: inexcusable in either case, considering how influential this book has become.   Is it because it offers the best possible advice on how to navigate the most clear and direct path from singleness to marriage?  No.  For the vast majority of singles, the approach described in this book will be too rigid and contrived to be workable.  Few couples have actually gotten together this way.  The real reason why this book, with its overwhelmingly female readership, has sold so well comes down to one main reason: there is a SEVERE SHORTAGE OF SINGLE CHRISTIAN MEN, as documented in CampuslifeCollegeGuide.com male/female ratios, and the Barna Research group website which estimates the shortfall to be in the MILLIONS.  Christianity Today recently identified the gender imbalance as being the issue that "rises to the top" for Christian singles.  Because Christians are encouraged to look at circumstances as springing from "God's plan" for their lives, many of the surplus women faithfully avoid doing the math, but certainly feel the lack of male attention.  Unfortunately, this often gets boiled down to some kind of "passive Christian guy thing", but it probably has more to do with the complacency that accompanies the abundance of women: which is the defining masculine climate wherever there is a man shortage, whether it's New York City, Post-war Russia or your local mega-church.  It's not so much a lack of male leadership, but a lack of males.  And so the idea of courtship appeals to the romantic longings of single Christian women frustrated by what they perceive to be a lack of initiative taken by single Christian men, who they greatly outnumber.  Since reading Christian books about relationships can be as titilating as any romance novel, many of these women will pour over every detail looking for the one piece of advice, the one thing they can change about themselves that will make a difference.  Which means they stay on the spiritual self-improvement treadmill, fuelling a Christian singleness industry with its own slogan "The Gift of Singleness" that refuses to tell them the truth about the Christian man shortage that is the greatest cause of their prolonged singleness!  Of course, their lack of contentment (an innate response that tells you that things don't add up) is something they are told to repent, ironically by pundits who themselves will not repent of how they profit from this symbiotic relationship.  But as long as these women can be convinced that their discontent is caused not by unnaturally protracted singleness that's the result of the Christian man shortage but their by own spiritual failings, there'll always be a market for Christian self-help books like this one.  Pure genius!  What's more, there are "unintended consequences" that can go along with Harris' model for "courtship" that he doesn't really address:  1) Because all masculine initiative taking must be based on a guy's intention to marry the woman, it makes asking a woman to do anything a BIG DEAL to him. This can have several sub-consequences:  (a) It creates a lot of anxiety for guys in terms of their decision-making and rejection-risk (getting turned down for a date is bad enough, but imagine having your "potential marriage proposal" crash and burn!) (b) It fosters prolonged crushes, as stakes get so high with the guy investing all kinds of time and energy in figuring out that this is "the one", he might not ever do it (c) Ironically, it can boost up the guy's expectations in terms of a woman's looks. Because the guy has to have everything worked out in their heads (that yes, this is the kind of woman I want to marry) lot of guys end up not bothering to spend time with girls who don't LOOK like whatever their "wife prototype" might be. Guys who date and don't make a big deal of "a date" are more likely to ask out women they never thought of marrying and possibly end up getting married anyways (In "How to Get a Date Worth Keeping", Henry Cloud explains how couples will admit that their spouses weren't really "their type" when they first met).  2) It keeps people from the humbling reality check that dating provides. Serial dating (as practiced in Latin American countries, where a guy will ask out tons of women, get turned down by most of them until he has a "short-list") teaches you where you stand with the opposite sex. You ask your way down your "ladder of options" until you find your equal (likewise for women, in terms of dealing with the facts about who's asking and who's not). With courtship, a man or woman can nurse an untested prototype of what they want in their heads for years. The idea that it's better not to have any previous flames to compare them to is FALSE. You're better off being compared to their last girlfriend/boyfriend (a real human being with chunky thighs and all) than with the evangelical Angelica Jolie/Brad Pitt that has filled their imaginations since adolescence!  3) It reduces interactive opportunities that promote the acquisition of social skills needed in a romantic context with the opposite sex. It reinforces the pattern of psycho-social-sexual immaturity you commonly see in Christian singles circles.  4) It's unfair to the woman to have some guy spring a potential marriage proposal (which is essentially what courtship is) on her without any prior notice that the guy (who's had a head start on working out his feelings) is romantically interested. Most Christian women seem to need some time to progressively get used to the idea of having a date with most of the guys who would realistically ask them, let alone entertain the thought of marriage.  5) It also heightens the significance of anything the men do when interacting with the women in their circle, who inevitably end up reading too much into their behavior and expecting too much whenever any nuance of interest gets expressed by a someone they like. Kind of like, "he's a nice, sincere, Christian guy and he wouldn't be spending this kind of time with me if he didn't think of me as marriage material, right?"...not always so.   If we are to stand back and take a look at it, the whole courtship redux really hasn't gotten off the ground: it works for too few people at this time. Maybe the world has changed too much, or perhaps there are other issues today's Christian singles face in the mating game that need to be dealt with first: such as the confusion about "the gift of singleness" and the shortage of men. I would recommend Debbie Maken's Getting Serious about Getting Married: Rethinking the Gift of Singleness for an alternative view of courtship that embraces the ordinariness and universality of marriage, instead of this moldy oldy.+books
2005's Most Dishonest Book+N+I can't speak with authority about other deseg cases, but I AM knowledgeable about the St. Louis case, having spent four years on the St. Louis Board of Education (1989 - 1993.).  Simply put, deseg has destroyed the St. Louis Public Schools (SLPSs), which were arguably, the best large public school system in the nation prior to deseg, when they were segregated and run by white Lutherans.  Today, after 26 years of deseg, the SLPSs are probably no more than one year from losing their state accreditation and being taken over by the state of Missouri. Let's consider some facts rather than the disinformation of dilettantes and poseurs such as Kozol:   COSTS  Deseg has cost the State of Missouri about $8 Billion between the Kansas City and St. Louis cases. The bill in K.C. totaled about $3.5 Billion when it finally ended, while the St. Louis case has almost certainly passed the $4 Billion mark. (These statistics are scrupulously hidden by the leftist news media.) What have we realized from this expenditure?  First of all, state money diverted to these two deseg cases was stolen from every school district in Missouri not participating in a deseg case. Small, rural school districts routinely spend between $4,000 and $5,500 per pupil each year. In St. Louis, the per-pupil expenditure has been as high as $11,711: Yet, those rural, so-called "out-state" districts do a far better job of educating and graduating students, despite having half the resources. (I'm sure in Kozol's mind they are merely "goyim," and deserve no better...)  Ironically, while less affluent "out-state" districts were robbed of state funding by deseg, the wealthier school districts in St. Louis County experienced a massive WINDFALL from deseg: Since they are reimbursed by the state the AVERAGE per-pupil cost for each city transfer, (rather than their "marginal" cost,) wealthy districts such as Clayton, Ladue and Parkway benefited from a massive infusion of new revenues, although these school districts have traditionally out-spent almost every other Missouri district by a factor of three or more. (For example, Clayton currently spends about $15,000 per pupil per year.)   ACHIEVEMENT  In the SLPSs, half the students test at the 20th percentile or lower on nationally standardized tests. This stat would be even worse, except that (I am told) the "LD" (or "learning disabled") kids do not take the standardized tests. There are legions of LD kids...  In a rare moment of wisdom and sobriety, a federal judge sitting on our deseg case ordered a test of its efficacy in the early 1990s. That study, called the "Lissitz Study" revealed that city students (i.e., black students) bused to predominately white county school districts improved less academically than did every other category of student in the SLPS. That is, they improved less than students in all-black, the "naturally"-integrated, and "magnet" schools.  When the Educational Testing Service still "normed" the SATs between 400 and 1600, the average SLPS student had a combined SAT of 760. Worse yet, these were the best and most motivated students, with further educational aspirations, who "self-selected" themselves to take the SATs and were therefore, a highly "skewed" sample relative to the average SLPS student.    Deseg is almost universally motivated by the laughable paradigm that, if we throw enough money at our inner-city schools, black kids will achieve at a level commensurate with white kids. Now that even William Coleman has repudiated his own research on this subject, ("The Coleman Report," cited in "Brown v. Board,") Kozol and deseg's other defenders could spend their time far more productively by studying the lessons of "The Bell Curve" in order to understand academic disparities between the races.  VESTED INTERESTS  It has been remarked that the defenders of deseg will never relent until the last white kid has been driven from the system. This is because the NAACP Legal Defense Fund is a "co-plaintiff" in most (if not ALL) U.S. deseg cases, and is periodically distributed "legal expenses" by the federal courts. These are a very important source of revenue to the NAACP, which has experienced declining membership and numerous financial scandals over the last several decades.  Similarly, deseg has meant a great deal more than the mindless expenditure of billions to bus students around. One of the most injurious elements of the St. Louis deseg plan has been a massive affirmative-action program for administrators and teachers. The SLPSs now employ more functionally illiterate individuals than the N.B.A., and have become nothing less than an employment agency for lazy and incompetent blacks with political connections.   Essentially, the same black women who, 30 or 40 years ago were employed in middle-class households as "domestic" help, are now SLPS teachers and administrators. ("I is a teacher.") How anyone who never really absorbed a high school education could be presumed able to teach mystifies all but Kozol and deseg's other defenders. If teachers and administrators in the SLPSs were required to take the S.A.T.s, more than half would test significantly below average: We know this because they have already demonstrated the fact!  Approximately half of all SLPS teachers and about 60% of its administrators attended Harris-Stowe State Teacher's College, which has the second lowest academic standards of any institution of "higher learning" in Missouri. Last time I called their admissions office, I was told that Harris-Stowe accepted applicants with a combined SAT of 780. It should come as no surprise that recent measures of SLPS student SATs do not differ significantly from those of many of their teachers.   HYPOCRISY  A truly fascinating phenomenon I have observed is that there seem to be few defenders of deseg among those whose kids actually participated in such a program. It doesn't take a parent long to understand that deseg isn't so wonderful when your kid gets rolled for his lunch money every day, or your daughter gets beaten up because she won't date outside her race.   Now Kozol may not have kids, but I'll just bet that if he does, they did not participate in any voluntary deseg programs, if any were available where he resides. (The Jews are mustard for this sort of thing, as long as they are merely allowed to posture and it doesn't actually cost them anything...)  I once had the rare opportunity to sit next to Dr. Susan Uchitelle, the  Jewish woman who headed the St. Louis Deseg's "Voluntary Inter-district Coordinating Council" throughout the 1980s and 1990s. (She was paid $60,000 per year, but from what I could discern, her sole responsibility seemed to be running interference with the news media, so the rubes out there wouldn't get the wrong idea about the joys and benefits of deseg whenever there was a stabbing, gun-shot incident, murder, or race riot.)  I considered it an "opportunity" because I was able to ask her a question that no one had ever had the impertinence to ask of her before: "Have any of your children participated in the voluntary transfer program?" (That is, were her kids, who would have been "poster children" for the county-to-city deseg program, allowed to transfer from their all-white county schools in order to be voluntarily bused to inner-city schools?)   What do you think was the answer, oh gentle reader? Your response to this question may have far-reaching implications for your understanding of the world around you and some varieties of its inhabitants, such as Jonathan Kozol...   (I'll give you a hint: Susan Uchitelle's attitude toward deseg is very much like Leona Helmsley's attitude toward taxes...)       +books

A Bad Time for Motherhood+P+I have been a fan of J.A. Jance since I met her in a bookstore browsing through the mystery section. She convinced me to try one of her books, which I did, and loved it. She had also told me that she would soon start a new series - that was many years ago and I've been enthralled with each new book since the Joanna Brady series began. These books usually leave you turning pages as fast as you can read, but this one wasn't quite that captivating. Don't get me wrong, it was still very good, just not the excellence I've come to expect from Jance's writing.   This is the ninth novel featuring Joanna Brady, a tough Arizona sheriff who enchants her way into the reader's hearts. In the last novel, Devil's Claw we leave Joanna as she's honeymooning with her new husband Butch, after having her home destroyed by a maniac. Paradise Lost picks up shortly thereafter.   Joanna is once again caught in the struggle to maintain balance between being sheriff, being a new wife, and being a mother to a 12-year-old. While Joanna and Butch are at a sheriff's conference across the state, Joanna's daughter, Jenny, goes on a Girl Scout campout. Jenny and another girl, Dora Matthews, sneak off after lights out only to find trouble in a big way. They stumble across a dead body. Because the girls were breaking rules, they are sent back to Bisbee while the sheriff's department investigates this murder in Apache Pass.   When Dora Matthews, turns up dead the next day, Joanna is worried about Jenny's safety and the balance between the various hats she wears comes tumbling down around her. Added to this second murder, is a third murder - the body of the prime suspect in the first murder turns up. Three deaths in a matter of four days are more than Bisbee has ever seen and it's up to Joanna to help solve them.   The end of Paradise Lost is predictable and not one of the better suspenseful conclusions that Jance has created in the past. J.A. Jance has always tied up the loose ends, but this time she leaves one flapping in the gentle Arizona breeze. The subplot involving a series of carjackings is never fully developed and leaves much to be desired by the reader. She eludes to this subplot several times, but there is no meat to it and nothing ever comes of it - no tie in to the murders, no interesting side journey, just a passing mention every once in a while.   And a low point in this book was Joanna's wavering attitude towards her overbearing mother, Eleanor. She finds neutral ground and "understands" her mother. I didn't buy it - it was too passe for me. Joanna wouldn't buy into the poor, poor me bit, the martyrdom, that her mother is excellent at portraying. But this time she does and it is very anti-climatic - I wanted a good, old fashioned tongue lashing that we've come to expect when these two clash.   The one thing that is decided in this book is Joanna Brady will run for reelection as Cochise County Sheriff. I'm sure the next book in this series will encompass the campaigning and how it affects Butch and Jenny. It should be interesting.+books
Insightful Critique of Islam, a Must Read+P+Insightful critique of the Qur'an and related materials on Mohammad and Islamic history, current events, and terrorism.

Dated and Biased+N+I did not like this book very much. The author treats her subjects as if they were some sort of cockroach species under her idealistic American microscope.  It is more accurate to say that this book is an account of how expatriates "survive" in KSA and not a true representation of the nation or its people. It is full of supercilious generalizations and patronizing commentary. It fully conforms to the biased view of Muslim nations presented in the Western media.  I know many Saudis and they are nothing like the examples presented in this book. To the contrary, they are some of the most hospitable and genuine people I have come accross.  If you want the "Fox News" version of Saudi, by all means read this book+books

yecch...+N+I picked this book up because I was running out of decent mystery novels, and figured I was primed to love it given my obsession with the outdoors as well as mysteries.   It only gets two stars because I actually made it through. And I only got through it because I had nothing else to read.    I know Nevada Barr is a "name," and judging by the number of her books stocked in my local bookstore, a popular one. But I could list the things that are wrong with her writing for...well, let's just say more space than Amazon is going to give me for this review. Her prose is bad. Her imagery is unlively (and if you're going to write about a landscape like Anna Pigeon's, you sure as hell ought to be able to write it). Her characters range from the merely flat to the utterly ridiculous (Anna's romantic progression through this book: "Oh, I am widowed and my life will never be the same without my husband" to "Oh, it might be fun to be a lesbian" [an out-of-the-blue idea the author never bothers to resolve] to "Let me have a fling with this random man, who, by the way, has as much character as a cardboard cut-out").   Worst of all, she cheats. I guess mystery writers don't have an official code, but according to the Dorothy L Sayers model, Thou Shalt Not Give the Detective Clues Not Given To The Reader. A mystery novel is no fun if the puzzle isn't there for you too. Of course, if Nevada Barr had given us all the evidence she gives Anna Pigeon, there wouldn't be a mystery to have a novel about. Her cheating merely covers up her inability to produce an engaging and puzzling plot.   This was a pathetically sub-par book for the amount of attention it and its sequels have received. If you're looking for an amazing female detective, check out Laurie R King's two series, one about Sherlock Holmes' feminist partner Mary Russell (as unlikely as it sounds, and more than good enough to make up for it), and the other about San Francisco cop Kate Martinelli. If you want a book about living in the desert, I'd suggest Edward Abbey's _Desert Solitaire_ (it even has a brief appearance by a dead body), or his hilarious eco-terrorist adventure _The Monkey Wrench Gang_.   Anything but this+books

God Code Review+P+As a seer, I have received information for almost 30 years that we are each an individualization of God and God is actually the sum total of all.  I am happy to read in Gregg's work that he has discovered scientific evidence of this fact which I hope will motivate readers to turn within to find their own divinity as opposed to seeking it from an outside source+books
Easy and Substantial+P+I find this book very easy to read. It is fraught with valuable, profound, substantial insights. It will rapidly acquaintance people who are not yet familar with MBA topics and it will solidify the knowledge of veterans in these issues. So, either way you win. Also, even though this book is intended mainly for service providers (doctors, lawyers), it can be easily extrapolated to any managerial work at whatever stage.

To clear some things up on the issue of the author...+P+The original text WAS written by Captain Charles Johnson in 1724.  In 1932, John Robert Moore announced that the real author was Daniel Defoe.  He was so certain that he wrote a book about it (Defoe in the Pillory and Other Studies).  He was so convincing that most libraries/ publishers changed the cataloging.  However, in 1988, P. N. Furbank and W. R. Owens proved him wrong, also in book form (The Canonisation of Daniel Defoe), based on the fact that there wasn't a single piece of documentary evidence that Defoe wrote the book.  Long story short, Johnson wrote the book, not Defoe+books
Illuminating+P+This book is about a skeptical journalist who finds himself on a most revelatory venture when he accompanies Ian Stevenson, noted reincarnation researcher, on trips to investigate cases.  He openly acknowledges his skepticism at the outset, and slowly reveals how he became convinced that there is something going on in the area of reincarnation studies.  Ian Stevenson is very cautious and methodical, rejecting any cases that have even a hint of taint of the subjects.  Under his exacting criteria, he still finds some cases that simply cannot be explained away as products of hoax, inadvertent communication of information, or the great catchall, "coincidence" or "lucky guesses."  I appreciated how Mr. Shroder revealed his skepticism and came to an understanding that there is a lot more going on in the universe than what can be explained through traditional approaches to reality+books
I disliked Anna+N+I can actually understand Morvan's character better given the 14th century backdrop of this novel. However, Anna sounded more like a 21st century feminist to me. She did not sound very genuine for a woman in that period. I wish Madeline had never written this book, given that this is the only one of her 11 novels (if I remember the number correctly) that I had to put down before reaching the end. I just could not take the characters, mainly Anna. However, I loved to see David drop by :)..   Rags+books
Where are the flags? And sound effects?+N+I remember hearing about this book by the great patriot Sean Hannity sometime in 2001, then it was a mere idea. From that time on, until August 20th 2002, I waited for what I thought would be the greatest book of all time. I remember seeing the cover art and hearing about the title: "Let Freedom Ring" with not just a picture of Sean Hannity on the cover, patriot that he is, but also a flag. I loved it, couldn't be more happy.  Well, the day of the book's release, I took a day off work (i've never missed a day of work before in my life), and rushed to get this book. It looked better than I ever imagined.  With the flag on the cover and the title of "Let Freedom Ring," I thought, finally, technology has caught up to our patriotism. I expected a book filled with flags, flags with sound effects. Maybe some firework sound effects.   Boy was I wrong. I opened the book only to the colors black and white. No red. No blue. No stars and stripes. I quickly turned the pages, looking, searching for flags. I found none, no sound effects either, no fireworks.   At that point, I went into a 4 year long depression. I nearly committed suicide at several points. It's only now that I can bring myself to review this man's book, patriot that he is.   I say this so you know what you're getting yourself into. There are no flags, no stars and stripes, no fireworks, no sound effects.   I have since recovered, but only because of old stars and stripes. I went back to teaching last year, not fully recovered, and my colleagues, knowing how much I love America and the STARS AND STRIPES, suggested I have my class do a research project: find the most patriotic book ever made.   The methodoloy was simple: A book made out of flags with flag pictures would score high, a book that was not made out of a flag or flags and had no pictures of flags would score the lowest.   We found some very good books and they did cheer me up. The one that was the most patriotic by far was a book called "President Jesus: How Jesus Wrote the Constitution, Freed the Slaves, and Won World War II." Its published by a small church in Texas. I was very proud of my students for finding it. It has brought countless joy to my life. Along with the book, made entirely out of a flag, with flag pictures, and written in blue and red ink, you get a giant flag. I'm not sure of the dimensions, but they had to haul it to my house in a moving truck. I've draped it over my house and it covers it completely. People even have to crawl under the flag to enter the house.   Now I often go outside and just gaze at old stars and stripes for hours at a time, smiling.+books
Can't believe it won the Quill Award+N+I loved The Secret Life of Bees but I found this book to be formulaic and uninteresting.  Its difficult to like any of the characters, especially  the main character, and much of the scenes with the monk are sexually gratuitous. It has as much deapth as a Harlequin romance novel.  The relationship between her and the mother was a bit more dimensional but only slightly.  All in all, a poor follow-up to Sue Monk Kidd's break out bestseller.  Don't waste your time. +books
"There is all I ever loved!"+P+These heartbreaking words are spoken by Quasimodo near the very end of this novel but they could just as easily have been uttered by any number of the characters in this magnificent and awe-inspiring story. Because of an inappropriate English translation of the title of this book, not to mention the popular characterization of Quasimodo, it is always assumed that the "half-made" and hideous-looking bell-ringer of the cathedral of Notre Dame is the central character of this tragedy, but he is not. His unrequited love for the beautiful La Esmeralda is only one of the tragic tales told throughout this novel.   The story is set in Medieval Paris in the year 1482. The town has just celebrated the Feast of Fools with Quasimodo being chosen as the reigning Pope for the celebration. Quasimodo is the adopted son of Claude Frollo, the Archdeacon of Notre Dame cathedral. La Esmeralda is an exquisitely beautiful young gypsy girl who, along with her trained goat, Djali, performs throughout the streets of Paris to the delight and amusement of the townspeople. Dom Frollo has been secretly lusting after La Esmeralda and believes her to be a witch sent by Satan to turn him away from his priestly vows. On the evening of the Feast of Fools, Dom Claude enlists Quasimodo to help him kidnap the gypsy woman in order to do away with her and rid his life of the temptations she represents. Esmeralda is rescued but the night will set into motion a tragic chain of events which will ultimately claim as its victims all three of these central characters. Two other victims in this tragedy are Dom Frollo's younger brother, Jehan, who the Archdeacon cared for from the time he was orphaned as infant but who turned out to be a great disappointment and Esmeralda's mother, perhaps the most tragic figure in the entire novel, a woman who believed for fifteen years that her daughter was dead only to be reunited with her and have her taken away again all in the space of a few minutes.   This novel is filled with unbelievably vivid descriptions of the city of Paris and it's medieval inhabitants. Victor Hugo brings the city to life and you will feel as if you are actually walking the streets and experiencing events as they unfold. When Quasimodo is tortured upon the wheel in the pillory as punishment for his participation in the attempted kidnaping of Esmeralda, you will feel yourself almost a part of the jeering crowd. The scene where Esmeralda literally parts the crowd to come forward and offer Quasimodo a drink of water has to be one of the most profound in all of literature! And near the end of the novel when Quasimodo is frantically trying to fend off the soldiers and gypsies who are attempting to ram through the door of the Cathedral and capture Esmeralda, the scenes in which he throws not only boulders but bodies over the balustrade of the church are horrifyingly realistic.   It is hard to capture with words all of the feelings that Victor Hugo evokes with his splendid writing but suffice it to say you will be deeply moved by this story. I have been a fan of the film version with Charles Laughton and Maureen O'Hara for many years but as is most always the case, the movie cannot hold a candle to the book itself. This novel really defies the ratings here at Amazon but as I can only give it at most five stars, I do so wholeheartedly and with great enthusiasm. The Hunchback of Notre Dame is definitely the finest classic I have ever read! --B. Eden+books

A Stellar book about the possibility of a "good death"+P+I think I've now bought 6 copies of this book, for my own library, to lend to people who are interested and might benefit, and to give as empathy gifts to friends and relatives entering Hospice, or their grieving families after a loved one's death.  I have Stage IV - advanced, terminal or incurable (take your pick) breast cancer.  I've been in treatment, continually adjusting as best as I can to new treatments, new worries and new symptoms, trying to preserve as good a quality of life as possible along the way.  Meanwhile, Final Gifts has helped me accept and move towards the idea of quality of death being an important event for me and those I love.  Once I give up treatment, or treatment fails me (whichever comes first), I've arranged for a local Hospice organization to help my husband and I cope, at home.  Having read Final Gifts, it was easier for me to go ahead with planning my graveside funeral according to my culture and preferences, to hire a local stone cutter to design my headstone together - he has since completed it, other than the date of death, so it will be ready to mark my gravesite a week after I'm buried, and even to write my own obituary (to the extent that I know the information).  All this is done, a relief - even a pleasure, to have had a say beforehand, and Final Gifts, which I and then my husband read over a year ago, provided the impetus, and the hope for a death with dignity and beauty+books

My favorite Harry Potter volume...+P+After purposely avoiding the entire Harry Potter frenzied bandwagon, I finally gave in.  My curiosity was peaked following a news story I saw in regards to some folks burning Harry Potter books in protest. I had to find out what exactly the fuss was about.  Knowing nothing about the books I randomly picked up the Prisoner of Azkaban, actually the third book in the series by J.K. Rowling.  The minute I picked it up, I couldn't put it back down and read the entire book and continued on to its two predecessors.  I had joined the Potter bandwagon.   The story starts the same as each with Harry spending the summer at his dreadful aunt & uncle's house before returning to another year at magic boarding school - Hogwarts - where he is learning to be a wizard.  In this, his third year at Hogwarts, Harry, now 13, is a teenager and all the complications that accompany that stage of life on top of discovering there is an escaped prisoner from the wizard prison Azkaban rumored to be pursuing him.  Of course, the story isn't as simple as that.  For the first time, we get a real look into Harry's past and the greater, darker story unraveling of Harry's connection to the evil Lord Voldemort that will run the remainder of the series.  Even with the impeding moments of doom, life saving time travel and frightening shadowy Dementor's lurking about, the story isn't entirely angst filled.  There are plenty of humorous moments originating from normal awkward coming of age relationships and experiences.  From Harry's two best friends constant bickering to discovering girls and a map of secret passages that leads to plenty of trouble and humor along the way.  When Harry is warned escaped Azkaban prisoner is after him, Harry prioritizes like most normal teenagers by focusing on what is really important - sports!  Whatever lofty expectations the surrounding wizard community puts on him, Harry doesn't view himself as that hero.  His story is much like Cinderella's story or The Little Princess by Frances Hodgson Burnett.  Like Sara, Harry finds his fortune, who his parents were, and his new guardian, but his troubles are not solely with his wicked step family or a money hungry orphanage keeper.  Throughout Harry & Sara stay true to the people who have stood by them thru hardship.  They remember the true friendship and mercy from the few that bestowed it.   As a result of Harry being rather new to the Wizard World, he is naï¿½ve to the fear inspired by Lord Voldemort or rather "You-know-who" as the magic community refers to him as.  This allows Harry to speak with a boldness that challenges the adults in his world to face a fear they don't wish to acknowledge.  Harry sees the truth of what is to come, what they refuse to see; Lord Voldemort's return.  In The Secret Garden, also by Burnett, Mary Lennox comes to mind.  While she was not as humble or endearing initially as Harry or Sara, with her obstinate & stubborn curiosity she helps the adults in her world to face the fears literally crippling the one thing they were trying so hard to protect.  As Harry unravels his parent's death, in the process he brings to light the truth of those comfortable deceptions the adults in his world have chosen to believe; but understanding and acceptance does not come quickly.    And as with all the Harry Potter series the magic jargon and side stories fabulously set the stage and draw you into its world.  Harry's world isn't the idealistic fairy tale where everyone lives happily ever after.  Becoming a wizard doesn't give Harry a perfect life nor does it return his parents, which is the one thing his heart aches for.   It is what makes Harry a relatable and loveable character throughout the series. There are seven books total in this series by Rowling, not including a few fictional Hogwart's text books written as supplements.  Six of the books are currently published with Rowling working on the final book due out in 2007.  You won't find me in line at the midnight release for the highly anticipated finale, but I will be preordering!  It is a great fairy tale with boundless imagination and humor for all ages+books

The Lord is My Shepherd+P+Once again, Kushner brings his deep pastoral sensitivity to bear on poetry, literary structure and theology in this much loved psalm. His writing style is gentle and accessible to all, as he reflects on the Twenty-Third Psalm.    +books
Shocked and disgusted+N+I was exposed to this book in what I think is the most unfortunate way possible, it was read to my child in her public school Kindergarten class. I was stunned and emotional when she came home and told me her teacher told her that a candy cane was a J for Jesus, and that the red stripes were his blood, and if she loved Jesus the white would wash it away. My child is five years old, and was disturbed by the whole thing.  This book has no part of the Christmas story in it, and the tasteless metaphor of it is impossible for a young child to understand.  The illustration is graphic and also not age appropriate.  The only good that has come from this absurd destruction of an innocent holiday treat is that now I am even more communicative and vigilant about my child's education and exposure, even in the school I trust with my child's life and well-being+books
A good compliment to the "Myth America" TV series.+P+As with most TV series you get statements with out support. So I tracked down the Richard Shenkiman book to get some background to the statements about American myths. I was not disappointed. It is as if he was reading this book on the TV with more graphic representations for the different media.  The book is worth reading. However the format may not be to some peoples liking as it is short choppy statements and the chapters are divided into subjects as, Discoverers and Inventors, Presidents, Sex, and Art.  There is a fair set of footnotes to lead you to further reading. You may need this as he sometimes stretches a point.  Final analysis, you are better off reading this to give a better perspective on reality. Read it to your kids and save them a lifetime of "Legends, Lies & Cherished Myths of American History". +books
Living on the Ragged Edge-The Simple Life+P+LIVING ON THE RAGGED EDGE is a commentary on the Old Testament book of Ecclesiastes. This was a life-changing book for me in 1986. My whole life had literally collapsed right in front of my eyes. And I also had a nervous breakdown all in the pursuit of success and graduate school. This book seems to advocate living the "Simple Life", knowing God, having a wife and kids, not overdoing work or success. I have received alot of abuse the past 20 years about why I don't go back to graduate school; and the wisdom of this book is part of the reason. I had written to Radio Havana Cuba once and had said that this is a religious book that even Fidel Castro could appreciate! I hear that since then he invited to Pope to come to Cuba to visit. We do live in an insane money-hungry society that has no values, no philosophy, no religion but the pursuit of the "Almight Dollar"! This ia a major reaqon for why we see American society disintegrating right before out eyes! It is not deliberate, but I think I see myself as living in the 60's because of circumstances beyone my control. People in authority try to make my life as miserble as they can so as to pressure me into going back to college-this is called persecution.  The amazing thing about our secular achievements is that when we die, we do not get any reward in Heaven for them. Both Solomon in Ecclesiastes and Jesus Christ in the New Testament say that we get no reward in the next life for being a successful doctor, lawyer or businessman. Jesus said to lay up treasure in heaven-good works like charity towards the poor. Also I noticed that it is God who gives man the ability to enjoy life. And contrary to religious tradition in puritalical America, I have found on my electronic Bible the advice to "eat, drink and be merry"{within moderation, of course.) the phrase occured five times in Ecclesiatstes. God gives the common man and the man who pleases him the ability to enjoy life. The life of the success driven rich man is so full of stress that he may have a fancy meal, yet he cannot taste the food he is eating! You can only live in one house at a time. You can only drive one car at a time. You can only spend so much money in this life because when you die, you won't have it any longer. You can have a house full of adult toys and possessions; yet you are unable to enjoy any of them. I would focus on having a couple of things and being able to use them to the full. Solomon spoke from experience. He was the richest man in ancient Israel as he was the king. He had all the education a man could want. He had sexual pleasure-a harem of 500 wives like the Sultan of Brunei. He had more horses that he could ride. He had more achievement than he knew what to do with. Yet he couldn't find satisfaction. His advice was to fear God, obey his commandments and enjoy the simple pleasure of life. He found out that sometimes more is less.  In an exotic fashion, I had found out about INSIGHT FOR LIVING while monitoring Trans World Radio broadcasting from the island Monaco to England in 1986. They sent me a magazine promoting the book. I bought it and the study guilde and used them both. I have read LIVING ON THE RAGGED EDGE three times since them. This is obviously a message that God wants me to get into my spirit. And this is actually good advice for all of materialistic, worldly America! Another afterthought is this. I don't think that joining the Army is the place to go to find God. But I had managed to get away from my home, family, church and social influences in Toledo. I read the Bible independantly and did not often attend church. I had found Ecclesiastes in the Old Testament; yet the message seemed to offend and irritate me at age 17. I think that you may have to go through a few things in life, have a few misfortunes and find a need to look to God for answers in the Bible to really appreciate this book and Ecclesiastes! Ecclesiastes is a book of godly philosphy! Philosophy=the study of wisdom!  +books
Literalism vs. Essence+P+"The tao can be told is not the eternal tao."   So you see, Mitchell goes about the impossible task of translating and telling us about something that can't be told. If you understand this, you understand why rather than a literal interpretation, he chooses instead (and succeeds, in my opinion) in capturing the essence. It's hard for me to imagine anyone not liking this book but to each his own. As for me, I rate it as excellent without any qualifications+books
The book is being overrated+N+I personally feel that the  the book is small, being rightly meant to be carried by residents in wards, but cramped with borrowed information which exceeds the capacity of the book. A lot of it feature in other standard texts and nothing is new.The algorithms too are borrowed. Information on antibiotic usage and common tropical disorders in detail are lacking. Unnecessary publicity is being given to the book and The Osler Medical Handbook by Cheng and Zaas is far superior to this in all aspects. Another important aspect is that students reading the book do not read standard texts and are clearly at a disadvantage while appearing in examinations.The book needs to be rewritten in another format to be successful. Professor K.N.Viswanathan , AVMC, Pondicherry, Indi+books
Dissapointed+N+I watched this movie in Religion and was dissapointed that it didn't follow the book. I read the book as a child and saw almost every version of the movie available, but now seeing this one again (I'm pretty  sure I saw this before) I was annoyed at how much it changed the book. I think if your going to take a book and make it a movie you have no right to take such liberties. The way Mary discovers the garden and the key are absolutely rediculous. Also I don't like colin's strange fortune-teller like air. I had no emotional reaction to the ending where the children are all grown up because they just seemed like random actors and didn't even remotely resemble the children. Don't get this version if your a purist+books
Great Animal Lovers Book+P+If you don't already have this book, get it.  It will not be a duplicate of something you already have.  My wife and I saw critters we didn't know existed, and we're both passionate about critters.  The author has a great writing style, the photography is excellent, the book covers a broad diversity of fauna.  It's not a field guide, not a biology text, it's fun and it's top notch.  I envy a previous reviewer that has been out on field trips with this guy+books
Only read half of it+N+I picked this book up at my public library because I had put it on my reading list a while back when I saw that the President(!) of the United States George Bush read it while he was on vacation too.  I went to my local cofee place and got a MEDIUM regular cofee flavored cofee but in a LARGE cup (so theres room for plenty of milk which I like and also you only get charged for a medium even though its in a large).  Anyway I am reading this book and it seems okay but then this guy with a laptop bumps into my chair where I have rested my cofee which is not at all my fault because thats why the chair has a little ledge there.  So then this guy says he is sorry but that doesnt exactly unspil my cofee if you catch my meaning.  And he offers to pay for a new cofee but it doesnt really matter its the principle of the thing.  Anyway then he leaves and I notice my copy of the book has cofee spilled on it not just my pants as I thought previously.  So I'm not about to read a book with cofee stains all over it so I take it back to the library.  Now here I have to point out that I had a little incident a couple weeks back with the librarian and long story short they lost a book about a fireman that I returned and made me pay for it but not without a fight.  Well you better believe that same librarian who yelled at me is watching me now whenever I go in there and she sees that cofee stain right off when I turn the book in.  I explain that its still perfectly good and you can still read it and it wasnt even my fault and maybe they should get the $8.50 from the cofee house they made the cofee not me.  But you can guess how this ended up.  I am down another $8 dollars and change (I paid the .50 cents in pennies I got from the place I keep pennies in the car which got me a cross look since I counted them out one by one but it was worth it).  And I never finished the book since it was ruined.  But! I liked the parts I read "okay" and if the President likes it I guess it gets FOUR STARS only I made it TWO STARS because I only read half.  Maybe I will read the second half later if that librarian retires and then I will come back and give this book it's missing TWO STARS if it ends well.  Lesson learned is life is not always fair but you "keep on keepin on" like they say+books
I was surprised that this is such a good book+P+When I see Suzanne Somers I just see Chrissy from Three's Company and all that snorting and dumb blonde-ing!  I never paid any attention to any of the Suzanne Somers books because I figured this was just another celebrity attaching their persona to something.  My library happened to have this on the shelf and since I had some time to kill while waiting for my daughter to pick out her books I decided to flip through the recipe section since I knew it was a low carb type of diet and I do atkins.  I was very interested at what I saw so I checked it out.  I have been totally shocked at how easy and terrific her ideas are and in fact her philosophy is quite interesting too.  I am really impressed.  I have a totally different viewpoint now of Suzanne Somers.  I love this recipe book so much I had to buy it so I&quot;d have a copy+books
misunderstanding+P+nobody seems to realize the personal element in this book.her insinuations of violence as revenge are rhetorical and come from millenia of do i even need to say it?it's not like she is speaking on behalf of the movement but in behalf/against the years.  nobody's going to puncture your larynx with a stiletto,alright?i suggest those who think a woman expressing her rage in a violent manner for JUSTIFIABLE reasons to be so taboo read Henry Miller's Black Spring.perhaps more to your taste+books
let down+N+Total Control started really-really well for this reader (nice premise/set-up). It had an even more compelling middle (who? who is the bad guy??). The last third of the book imploded as I was pleading for lead character Sydney to get "done in" by the bad guys for being so utterly stupid and annoying. Nothing in this book added up well as it concluded. Baldacci let me down on this one+books
Unraveling a Tangled Skein of Deception+P+Long-time fans of the series will enjoy many elements of this book:  Sharon and Hy finally marry; Sharon's birth mother and adopted mother meet one another; Sharon's agency expands with some new operatives; and Rae finds herself back doing some detection.  In addition, there's a dark, detailed plot that builds from a very old, cold case.   One of the strengths of this story comes in Ms. Muller's deft handling of so many past characters and weaving them the on-going story line.  It adds a rich texture to the book that builds depth.  That texture is nicely developed also by Ms. Muller's strong ability to build a sense of place as almost another character in the story.   The cold case is quite complex and requires an extensive investigation using many resources.  But it's not a classic mystery in that you'll be able to put three clues together in the beginning and figure out who did what to whom.  Instead, you'll be able to figure out the next plot development in the procedural about 5-15 pages ahead of time.    The book's main drawback comes in its unappealing characters.  Most readers like either sympathetic characters or disgusting villains.  This book lacked both.  The characters were either completely flat, highly superficial or just plain selfish.  But there was nothing about them to attract our interest other than the role they played in the plot development.    Authors often have to choose between developing their plots and their characters.  While we get lots of character development concerning the missing Laurel Greenwood, it's ultimately unrewarding.  The plot's needs won, but it's an unsatisfying victory.  The book's overall theme is about what it takes to make a good marriage.  I thought that element was done well.  I especially appreciated the nods to Bill Pronzini's nameless detective as part of that message.  But any long-time fan will enjoy the book.  New fans should go back to the beginning of the series and delay this book. +books
i was hesitant...+P+i was hesitant to read this because of it being on the supernatural side, but my friend encouraged me to read a couple of chapters befor making up my mind, and i am so glad she did.  it is one of the best books i have read.  even  if you don't buy into the whole ghost thing, i think that most will still love this book.  before you know it, you are totally wrapped up in it-- i couldn't put it down!+books
Another good one+P+Bosch is back and finally diving into his mother's murder case while he's been place on involuntary leave. Our favorite detective is put through the ringer and has to come face to face with some rather ulgy demons from his past.  One girlfriend hits the road and another is quickly picked up on the rebound.  For a workaholic, Bosch gets around.  This time, however, our rebound chick has some baggage--then again-so did our last girlfriend.  Her husband was a psycho-cop.  So maybe he just attracts women with serious baggage.  Though this was another multi-layered and complex case, I was able to figure out the real killer pretty early.  But with Connelly, the journey is just as intriguing as the destination+books
GREAT CONTINUATION!!!+P+Sometimes, when an author writes a trilogy, it's the second one that lacks the same pizazz  you fell in love with in the first or the fantastic ending of the third.  This was not the case.  In fact, she wrote about the spicy heroine here in the second book and that's brilliant+books
Another Elizabeth Berg Triumph+P+I normally cringe when I read "Read by the Author" on the front of a book on cassette because so many of them have no idea how to read out loud. Elizabeth Berg is a clear exception. She not only presents us with clearly delineated characters, each of them vocally fits the emotional description written by Ms. Berg. Listening to the story is a delight.  The story itself is a triumph. Each character is endearing and embued with the Berg warmth. Paige is remarkably optimistic, Diana is properly rebellious, and Peacie is tolerantly loving. As I am listening, I am seeing them all in my mind and I'm happy that they have come into my life for a few delightful hours.+books
Leave reality at the door+P+This is not a typical read for me, but I enjoyed it.  I read the first 148 pages wondering if this was going to be a waste of time, but when I hit chapter 44, I read the rest of the book in one sitting.  Loved Max, Frannie, Kit & all the others.  Looking forward to reading "The Lake House"+books
Good enough to make you wish it were better.+N+I have mixed feelings about this quasi-romance novel about an American teacher named Hope and Po-yu (Paul), her Chinese student. On one hand, it was often very interesting, as Ms. Liu gives a lot of historical detail about San Francisco and China. On the other hand, the characters were rather shallow. I didn't find Hope, who oddly resembled a whiny yuppie of the present day, particularly appealing. Po-yu was far more interesting, and was portrayed with some complexity and depth. The romance between Hope and Po-yu rang false for me. ("Honey, I first fell in love with you when I realized it was required for the plot to progress!") I still can't see what attracted them to each other. Also, did anyone else notice that any slight against Hope is recorded with meticulous detail (the rampant racism against Chinese at that time seems glossed over in comparison although it is mentioned), but Ms. Liu has some pretty crude stereotypes in this novel: a hearty blonde Swede, a drunk, surly Irishwoman, and Hope's one-sided-ly disagreeable mother-in-law to name a few. Also, she takes some pretty cheap shots at two groups it is still politically correct to demonize: all the Britons in the book are "right-o, jolly-good" bigots, and all the Christians are consistently hypocritical, or stupid, or both. In addition, much of the middle of the book is bogged down in political discussions that try so hard to be interesting that they're just the opposite. And to top it all off, the ending was forced. This novel could have been so much better: as this book is based on the lives of her grandparents, she obviously had some fascinating material to work with. And one more quibble: one of Hope and Po-yu's daughters is named Jennifer Pearl. In 1908 the name Jennifer pretty much existed in only one place in the world: Cornwall, UK+books
An easy read to kill the time, but not much more+N+Reading Dark Harbor is like watching a mediocre TV show that you can't be bothered to turn off. I listened to Dark Harbor as an audio book, so I don't feel too badly about wasting my time on it because I `read it' while I was doing other things that had to be done anyway, like driving.   If you are looking for something that feels fresh and new - Dark Harbor is not for you. This novel is about as innovative as an episode of Murder She Wrote. To illustrate: Stone Barrington and his cronies quickly deduce that an apparent suicide must have been a murder because the gun was found in the victim's wrong hand. (I think I actually saw that one on Murder She Wrote) Woods either can't be bothered to come up with a new idea or he simply doesn't care.   It is clear early on who is responsible for the murders in Dark Harbor. This isn't because the clues come together in any logical way, but rather because of the predictable nature of the novel. You can just tell. This doesn't mean that the solution makes sense. In fact, there are huge inconsistencies in the plot that make the ending feel forced.   It is as if Woods couldn't be bothered to think all of his plot lines through. Woods is compelled to include his regular characters in the novel even though they have little to do (except of course, to have sex with Stone). Holly barely says a word on her first trip to the island. On her second trip she has an obligatory romp with Stone and then gets kidnapped for the remainder of the novel.   Why was she kidnapped? I don't think anyone - including Woods - can answer that question in any plausible way. My theory is that Woods needed to work Holly into the plot and decided that putting her in peril would allow him to fill a few pages. It also allowed him to include Holly's dad (another regular character) in her search. Wood's motive seems obvious. The kidnapper's motive however isn't - her kidnapping makes no sense. But clearly this was something Woods didn't think was worth worrying about.   The best I can say about this novel is that it is a quick easy read (of course, in my case it was read to me). It may not be worth the time and trouble to actually read (and certainly not to buy) - but as an audio book from the library (with a limited selection of audio books to choose from) it helped me pass the time in traffic.  +books
Child-Directed Cooking+P+From age 4 to age 7, my daughter has greatly enjoyed cooking from this book.  Unlike when we cook together from other cookbooks or recipes, when we cook from this book, she can really take the lead, and I am her assistant.  At age 7, she is able to make some of the items entirely on her own.  Using this book has encouraged her to take an active role in preparing foods for our family and dinner guests.  She takes pleasure and pride in her creations, because she worked hard and they taste good!  Because of the thoughtful design of the book, the child doesn't have to be able to read to figure out what to do, with a little parental help.  The recipes included are healthful and tasty. The drawings and layout are appealing to children and adults.  I highly recommend this book to families with children from preschool through at least second grade to get your children into the fun of cooking.  Enjoy! +books
Amazing Gracie, an Amazing Book!+P+This book was great, such a heartwarming story.

I'm so glad I know the story of Gracie and Three Dog Bakery now!+books
The life of a meadow+P+Mr. Galvan's writing about a piece of property, at first, seems strange; however, as you read you become absorbed.  He writes of much more than the land, he writes of the people who live that land.  It takes a special person to live in the wilds of  Wyoming, and an extrodinary person to live in the isolated, rugged, raw, and unforgiving areas.  This is a book I have given as a gift to many individuals who know what it is truly like to live here in Wyoming, want to live here, or seem to possess that independence and creativity needed to live here+books
How a book can create a conflict, Said and his gross mistrepretations+N+Edward Said, created a proble and made a career of the Israel Palestine Conflict, and conviently died before he could also resolve the death and destruction he brought to the Arab Palestinians. He was a one man destruction derby under the guise of poetry, linguistics and hate and he helped stir up anti Israel and anti Jewish hatred on every University he spoke at. Hopefully, this "vintage" book will become no longer relevant, ans disappear+books

Known as America's Poet, Whitman is not poetic+N+Walt Whitman's life's work is his "Leaves of Grass", enlarged over the years with additional poems.  Regarded as America's poet, Whitman wrote in the 1840s through the 1880s, encompassing both the "Manifest Destiny" ideology of the pre-war, through the Reconstruction period of US History.    The poems are diverse and upbeat.  The language, for the most part, is clear and easy.  Nevertheless, like most poetry today, the poems are so little different from prose, except in the presentation into lines.  Very few poetic devises are used.  One may correctly criticize my critique as one who does not appreciate contemporary poetry.  But, in comparison to rhyhming verse by Longfellow, Frost, Byron, Browning, or Shakespeare, current poetry appears meaningless.    Although a classic, "Leaves of Grass" offers only one or two poems that qualify for a standard anthology.  None of his poems are memorable.  Not a single line is considered worthy of citing anywhere in literature.  I give two stars to the work, simply because I must admit my own incompetence in modern poetry appreciation.  Whitman is considered important enough to be the major poet in the movie, "Dead Poet's Society"; so, the reputation of the work must be quite impressive, though it beats me how that is+books
Amazing Insight!+P+This book was required reading at our office and at the time I wondered why, after all we had a great team! After taking the assessment test I realized we had lots of room to improve! The story was a quick and easy read but very effective. We implemented many of the ideas in the book and work much more effectively today than we did a year ago. Thanks for a great book+books
A lesson in with holding judgement+P+Four years ago I was completely smitten with Noll's Jung Cult and the many facinating threads to follow from the book's many descriptions of cults, personages and movements at the time of the fin de siecle.  I thought Noll  truly brilliant.  This past year I followed one of those threads from Noll  to Sonu Shamdasani's Cult Fiction.  Reading the two led me to a lesson in  scholarly research and withholding judgement.  I could have founded a Noll  cult after reading his writing.  I learned to question it more objectively  reading Shamdasani.  The two do a great tango and I have found it of  essence to read them both.  I don't know and find it ridiculous to say they  hate each other--hey they sell each others' books and I am a different  thinker and Jung adept after reading both authors.  Noll is rich with  references and associations--Sonu questions very thoroughly and almost  without flaw Noll's argument.  Shamdasani does grip Noll's hamstring but  the joy of reading the Jung Cult for me isn't flagged--only changed in the  sense of I am glad I got past Noll to read Sonu+books
Doesn't Compare+N+This book does not compare with 1) Atlas Shrugged, or 2) The Fountainhead.  In my opinion, those are two of the finest books ever written.  If you haven't read them, put We the Living aside and read them now.  I could not finish We the Living.  I got sick of the stupid relationship.  I guess I got about 1/4th the way through.  Maybe my tastes are changing+books
Best book ever...+P+tofcm was a awsome book.

Succinct guide to the art of Kendo.+P+Jinichi Tokeshi provides a succinct albeit comprehensive guide to Kendo and all that is entails. It begins with a short history of Kendo in an effort to familiarize the reader with the origins of the &quot;sport&quot;. Tokeshi then spends some time on the necessities such as equipment and the correct manner in which to wear the kendogi and bogu! He also pays strict attention to appropriate etiquette and behaviour. The book deals with the movements, strikes, general philosophy, rules, regulations and ends with short biographies on historically significant samurai/Kendo masters! All in all the book amicably demonstrates the &quot;elements, rules, and philosophy&quot; of Kendo and as a new student to the Japanese art of fencing it has proved indispensable+books
I would not buy this. +N+Speaking as someone who has been both fat and thin in my life I can honestly say this book did nothing for me. I do believe that all women are beautiful and we all should love our bodies. However, I don't think this book gets that message across! It sounds like the person who wrote this is no expert and is angry because she looks the way she does, failed to find a solution and is looking to tell the world how we should think and what we should find attractive. Besides that, it's kind of a one-sided book and repetitive. Also, I beg anyone claiming that being fat is healthy to look at the statistics again. Close to 60% of people in America are overweight, possibly more. This includes children. We are far bigger than we were 100 years ago and ingest far larger portions of food. Heart attacks are killing more and more people and it's victims are getting younger, sometimes even children and people under 30 years old. Sure, some people can be fat and healthy but those cases are so rare they are certainly not the majority. I do agree that pushing images of too-skinny supermodels is a bad thing but I don't think pushing overweight models would be any better. If you are overweight and looking to feel better about yourself, you might like this book. If you are like me and actually did something about the things you disliked, this will sound like a really whiny, excuse filled, negitive book. Yes, I work out to be healthy. Yeah looking better is a nice feeling but certainly not as important as how I feel. No, I don't want to look like a supermodel. I loved my body fat and I love it now, that's why I lost the weight to begin with. I want to live as long as I can in this body and feel the best I can instead of feeling slow, tired and heavy like I used be. I feel much better, my chronic foot pain went away and I have lots more energy. I work out 5 days per week and make a good living teaching others to be healthier too. This book does nothing to help people in the long run, it's just someone's angry rant about their warped perspective! Being obese isn't healthy and that's why people think it looks ugly, it's not because we are a brainwashed, shallow society! And no, being fat is not a fate worse than death, it IS death and kills millions of people every year!    +books
Only the worst of Eco+N+I have often joked that I would rather read Umberto Eco's shopping list than many of the so-called popular novels. In this book, Eco goes to prove me wrong. Eco has written a book that is a struggle to read, not because it is deep, complex, and rich but because it is an utter bore.  The story tells of the case of Yambo, a rare-book dealer living in Milan. Yambo suffers a curious brain injury straight out of The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat. In his case, he can not recall anything that ever happened to him but he can remember every book he ever read. Curious. But Eco fails to do anything of much interest with this defect. For example, Yambo runs a book studio and has a female assistant. Yambo worries that perhaps he had an affair with her and wonders how she would react. He need not have worried, because like everyone else, she treats him with no mention of the past. Yambo's wife is perfectly accepting of his condition and Yambo is able to bluff his way through conversations with any friends or acquaintances he meets. The end result is that nothing much happens and the book drones on.  Yambo decides to ride off into the country to visit his childhood home in hopes that something there may trigger his memories. Yambo wonders around and gives us a detailed description of his bowel movements. "A lovely snail-shell structure still steaming." I was underwhelmed. Yambo wanders through the house finding secret rooms and reading old books. But none of this seems to go anywhere. In fact, it seems more like an excuse for Eco to discuss (although not in any detail), pre- and post-World War II Italian novels that Eco fondly remembers.  The book does pick up a little towards the final part but by then I just wished the book would end. I cared nothing for the main character of the story and found the whole enterprise an absolute chore to pull myself through. Eco has done much better. If you are a true fan then go ahead and read the book to see that Eco is, indeed, fallible. Otherwise choose one of his other books instead+books
Self-Centered Santa Fe Instutitue Science Babble+N+If you think of the prime numbers as a Dr. Seuss staircase then this book's for you.  There are painfully cute analogies like throughout the book as the author shows off his faculty-lounge acculturation. It is least informed and most poorly written of the current spate of RH books.  Buy any of the others.  Avoid this one+books
Not much new information when you have read 'Kaizen' already+N+The book Gemba-Kaizen is somewhat disappointing if you have read the book 'Kaizen' already. It gives not much new information. The only new idea in  the book is the attention given to the 'Gemba', the place where the  processes are performed. Imai is right to stress the importance of the  Gemba for operational excellence and he gives some nice tools and examples  to illustrate the Gemba's importance. However, only one nice idea is  somewhat poor to fill a whole book. The major message of the book can be  told just as well in an articel of no more then 4 pages+books
this play shows its age+N+This play caused a great controversial stir when it was first performed in 1965. This is supposed to be a classic example of an existentialist and absurdist play. It was Pinter's first stage play and the one that made his reputation. Although it was very daring and shocking in 1965, the play has aged and lost its freshness and original power, in my opinion. There are many other portrayals of dysfunctional families that have retained their freshness and power--such families have been a mainstay of drama from the time of the ancient Greeks. Shakespeare and even fairy tales have built themselves around exploring the dark and abusive aspects of the family dynamic. So Pinter's on to nothing new or radical here. The script as such is blatantly misogynist. The one female role, Ruth, has no lines that sound human--she comes across as a stilted android. Ruth is so obviously not a real woman but a male projection of lust, fear, possession, hate, and paranoia. I recently saw this play performed in Manchester, UK, and have to wonder why people still think this play, with all its misogynist posturing, is relevant to a contemporary audience. If it were just a black absurd comedy, it might have worked better for me, but Pinter seems to be aiming at something deeper and more menacing yet can't seem to make up his mind if we're supposed to be feeling sympathy with his characters or taking them (and the underlying meaning of the play) seriously or not+books
You know he's right+P+How amusing we find the seventeenth-century minds which persecuted Galileo for saying that the Earth revolves around the Sun. But we have living in our midst a man who is so brave he has stated a truth even more obvious than Galileo's. Of course the races aren't equal. Everyone knows it but we don't want to admit it. Even most scientists are so scared that they would rather pretend that natural selection leaves intelligence unaffected. The official story is that it doesn't matter whether your race evolved in a jungle or a desert, the average brain will be totally unchanged by evolution. Everything else will change - height, colour, blood, hair, bones, teeth, eyes - but the brain must by some undiscovered law of nature stay the same. Read this book for proof of what you, in your heart of hearts, already know. +books
An Absolute Yawnfest!+N+When I read stuff on the back of this novel like, "preposterously brilliant", "a classic comic novel", and "Amis was a genuine comic writer, perhaps the best", I immediately snatched this book up and started rummaging through the sentences, paragraphs, and chapters with heightened interest. The book was interesting enough for me to buy it from Borders bookstore 30 minutes after reading a bit. Even though I didn't laugh, I believed I just had to read it from beginning to end. So I took this book home expecting something hilarious; the result: a genuine cure for insomnia. I don't care for all these praises of "masterpiece" or "this book explores the complexities of human condition and human relations". I want an interesting read; I'm not calling for an action-packed Ian Fleming, James Bond novel, I'm asking for something engrossing. I didn't get what I asked for.  The visually descriptive details in this novel are thoroughly lacking. Amis doesn't bother to write about the setting, the atmosphere, the people (except for Bertrand, Christine, and Margaret to some degree); as a result I have no idea what Welch, Dixon, Beesley, etc. look like. They all could be wearing bedsheets all the time for all I know.   All in all, this novel is not recommended: it lacks physical detail and humor.   P.S. If you search all the previous good recommendations you'll see the high reviews were simply given by "a reader"; probably the same dude+books
Not worth a dime....+N+The review title says it all....+books
"The true persuasion of sexual jealousy": Harold Bloom+P+Volume IV of "In Search of Lost Time" begins in the afternoon of the day of Princess of Guermantes's party, the one that Marcel had looked forward for so long as his definitive entrance into the world of high society. That afternoon, by spying on them, Marcel discovers with his own eyes, for the first time, homosexuality, in the form of an encounter between the depraved Baron de Charlus and the tailor Jupien, Marcel's neighbor in the property of the Guermantes. Later that evening, Marcel attends the party, attended also by a cast of characters like very few in literature: Charlus himself, a Swann close to his death, and others. The Dreyfuss cause keeps winning adepts, among them the very Prince and Princess of Guermantes, as the injustice of the sentence is revealed. In the party, Marcel continues on his way to disappointment about noblesse: they are people just like everyone else, only with grand names and big egos, but not much more.   Days later, with his mother, Marcel returns to Balbec, where, alone in his room he finally feels all the weight and sorrow of his grandmother's death, which had happened a year and a half before or so. It is a profound passage about the perception of death, everyday indifference to it, and the memories left to us by our beloved's passing away. In Balbec, Marcel reencounters with Albertine, in that perverted play of seduction and deceit, of attraction and rejection, which foreshadows a sick relationship. Disturbed by the graphic discovery of homosexuality, Marcel broods a lot about it. Two women who stay at the same hotel, and who openly show their lesbianism, awaken in Marcel a deep suspicion about Albertine's mysterious life, and so begins a torment of permanent jealousy, of anxiety and anguish which reminds the reader of the similar episode, in times gone by, of the beginning of the relationship between Swann and Odette. Meanwhile, Marcel has simultaneous relationships with a couple of maids of the hotel (literally simultaneous).   Marcel rents a car to go around with Albertine through the countryside and the coast, deepening his relationship with the capricious, naughty, annoying and elusive Albertine. In her company, he begins to frequent the little band of the social-climbing Verdurins (where Swann had met Odette years before), in the country estate they have rented from the Marquises of Cambremer. The central part of the book narrates that summer in Balbec and its surroundings, above all the wide mosaic of characters surrounding the Verdurins: insecure but arrogant Doctor Cottard and his simple wife; musician Vinteuil; the rustic and silent sculptor Ski; Professor Saniette, pathetic and constantly humiliated; and Madame Verdurin herself, presumptuous and increasingly successful in society. Over this fresco is shown the repulsive couple of Charlus and musician Morel, son of a former servant of the Prousts. Morel is the worst kind of climber and representative of sexual and moral corruption. In contrast with what happens in the first three volumes, here it seems that it is the nobles who yearn to be accepted in bourgeois society, and not the other way around. It is the bourgeois who attract interesting people: intellectuals, scientists, artists. Charlus makes a fool of himself big time, pretending everybody ignores his homosexuality, when in fact he is the target of cruel jokes and gossip. So continues the great saga of memory, sex, love, longing, and social observation of the XX Century.  Like in no one of the previous volumes, in this one the subject of homosexuality is analyzed in all its complexity. Marcel and Albertine's relationship forebodes hell. Charlus begins to sink. The bourgeois approach triumph. Like in all the previous volumes, what astounds the reader is Proust's immense power of microscopic vision to analyze individuals and dissect societies. It includes a magical reflection on dreams, as well as precious depictions of landscapes, sexual assaults, personalities and emotions+books
A very dull, dry piece+N+Mr Hibbert writes in a very dull, dry tone and I found it incredibly hard to be engaged in the story. He confuses the reader with time, people and his interpretation of what Elizabeth was like as a woman and a queen.  I only read this because I had to (for school). If you don't have to read it, then DON'T! It will bore you to death+books
Unfortunately the cure did not work for me+N+I've been an acne sufferer since I was 13 years old, and have been on every antibiotic, tried every topical medication in combination with those antibiotics, and have been on 3 courses of Accutane in the last 8 years.  My acne has never been extremely severe...but it has been quite resistant to most treatments.  I was really excited when I  bought this book and read the reviews, it sounded like it might really be the cure I'd been searching for all these years. The plan was a lot of work, especially at night with the ice packs, but I was willing to try anything. I followed the plan exactly as stated for 6 full weeks with little to no improvement.  That was my experience. +books
Balance and common sense.+P+I finally found a book to recommend to people of my era who "induldged" once upon a time and now have kids of their own. Responsible drug use can be no more traumatic than wine at dinner or the daily dose of caffine. It isn't about the drug it is about the way it is used and under what circumstances. Teach children the facts and show them responsible conduct and they are likely to respond accordingly.      However, Sullum did not write this book to condone the use of drugs. He wrote a book that instead argues to the logical conclusion that humans have always used drugs and they are likely to keep right on doing so. This book takes the wind out of the argument that drug use is somehow morally wrong. In fact he is pretty convincing when he claims that drug use is normal and to adopt a "Zero Tolerance" position towards drugs is impossible to do without creating high crime and coruption as a side effect. It is morally wrong to attempt to regulate moral behavior in a free society. It is acknowledged in the writing that "Some" people have trouble with drugs but the majority of users do not. Spending hugh amounts of public money to stop drug use in a free society does not make any sense but Sullum makes it clear to the reader that making sense has never been the point in the war on drugs. This really rung a bell with me because it appeals to my common sense and personal experience.My use of drugs in my younger days did not stop me from being honorably discharged from the military, getting a college degree or becomming a professional technician. I find that I am one of the many middle aged people who smoked some pot and still became reponsible adults. I also stopped, including cigarettes, when it no longer suited me. Just as Sullum points out that the overwhelming majority of us do. So... I would highly recommend this book to you if you are questioning the rationality behind the war on drugs. It is not going to convince you that you should be doing drugs and that is not the pont of the work. This study will give you many well argued points that demonstrate how the effort to stop drug use through draconian drug laws is not working and worse, doing more damage to society overall than the drugs themselves are causing. An example of this is tobacco. The author wrote a grate deal on this point. This is one of the most widely used and harmful of all the drugs in our society. Through education and a publily funded add campain the used of tobacco has dropped dramatically over the past 30 years without draconian enforcement. Just the opposite has happened with Marijuanna where the laws are becomming more and more draconian every year, the cost of enforcement is mind boggling and the easiest place to score a bag of pot is right down at the local high school.       It is a strange, sad situation to tolerate. +books
Music making as making more than sound+P+This book is an adapted version of the author's doctoral dissertation. Through ethnomusicological study of a music conservatory, Prof. Kingsbury brought to western music scholars and lovers a widened concepts of music,  music talent, and music performance. Music is much more than sound  structure. Music is also &quot;constructed&quot; by its social context.  Comparing the book with the dissertation, the sequence of the chapters is a  bit different. There are also some additions in the Temple University Press  book version. It is a thought provoking book  for ethnomusicologists,  musicologists, anthropologists, and particularly western music lovers+books

Get the book instead+N+I am big fan of PAX (Armstrong's company)and I own her book, CDs, and have attended her seminars. I really liked Keys to the Kingdom in the book version, however, friends and family that listened to the book on CD hated it. Not sure why exactly, but my recommendation is save a few bucks and get the book instead. Also, you should be warned that her work can initially seem anti-feminist. Hang in there though, because her message is meant to actually empower women in relationships. I can't tell you how much she forever changed my view and relationships with men. Did I also mention that apparently Alanis Morissette is also an Armstrong fan? In a nutshell, get her book, and her other CDs like "In Sync with the Opposite Sex". Also, her CD "The Amazing Development of Men" is a very condensed version of the concepts taught in "Keys to the Kingdom", which usually you can get for free if you attend one of her teaser seminars+books
Absolutely hilarious+N+This author claims to use logic and skepticism, all I can see from his book is a lack there of. This book along with Lyne's other book is the only propaganda, not some some massive CIA front. I was once a believer but no longer, UFOlogy and all that Tesla nonesense is just that, nonesense. If you want to learn about physics read anything by the genious of Einstein, not by this quack. If you don't want to waste your time I suggest getting any book by Philip Klass instead of this book+books
A Book to Cherish+P+How can one write a review of The Story of San Michele that comes close to doing justice to the book?  There are many humorous episodes, such as The Giant and Mamsell Agata, touches of the macabre in the description of the cholera epidemic in Naples, misadventures, like the journey to Sweden accompanying a young man (then his corpse).  There are also angry moments, as when his dog Tom is brutally kicked by the slimy Vicomte Maurice.  Who could not be moved by the story of the boy John, who was rescued by Munthe but never lived long enough to find a loving home.  It is a book that includes many memorable events in a life that was very full indeed.  Many of the chapters in this book could be made into marvelous films, given the right adaptation.  The Story of San Michele is very well written, to say the least, and the many people, events and personal feelings of the author combine to make this a special adventure.  Perhaps most special of all is Axel Munthe's relationship to animals that allowed him to get close, even to "wild" animals and have a special relationship with them.  He was a man who held nature and all life in special regard but was pragmatic in the face of illness and death.     I have had a copy since 1988 and I have given Axel Munthe's book as a gift and been thanked for the introduction.  I could not recommend this book highly enough.     +books
Defender of Self Government+P+Thomas Paine's &quot;Rights of Man&quot; is truly a classic defense of self government and reprsentative republicanism. Paine copmletely demolishes Edmund Burke's defense of aristocracy and monarchy as outmoded and absurd institiutions. Paine shows the immorality of monarchy and the plunder that it commits on it's own people through high taxes,unjust property laws,and priveleges for the nobility. Paine shows the virtues a representative system has over the monarchial form. He denounces  aristocracy and monarchy as &quot;frauds&quot; and based upon tyranny. The first review by Will Murphy critsizing Paine as a sort of statist is way off the mark. Paine did recommend many ideals of the welfare state. It must be remembered he was speaking to an age where a large wealthy aristocracy ruled alongside the monarch, living in luxury off the high taxes drained from the middle, lower and working classes. Paine was one of the formost defenders of freethought in religion,speech, and ideas.To imply Paine was a sort of 18th century fascist is utterly absurd and ahistorical. Paine was not an enemy of property, just an enemy of aristocracy,who in his day did not obtain property by hard work. Usually property rights in monarchial nations were written to favor the wealthy and powerful, and grant them priveleges at the expense of the populace. Paine completely destroys the ideal that a chosen few were meant or ordained by God to rule. If you love freedom, you can't go wrong with the &quot;Rights of Man&quot;+books
Don't know much about 50 states +N+I have read and reviewed many children's books in my 28 years as an elementary school librarian, and have found none with more glaringly inaccurate and unclear writing:Washington is the Evergreen State, not the "CHINOOK State", Mt.St. Helens did not have "LAVA" flows as the text says it did, the section about the state says that the Chinook winds are a "PAIR of winds" and does not explain what they are, they are warm winds that sometimes flow from east to west bringing warm air west. As a native of Washington, I began, and ended, reading in the section on our state. After reading the section I did not bother to check to see if the other states information was as inaccurate and poorly written, as I knew that I certainly would not want this book in any library nor in the hands of any children, dispite the vissual appeal.                                                        +books
Hip-Hop Cape+N+Pros: Someone recommended this book to me, and when he did, I asked him why in the world would he think I'd be interested in a book written by a cop, specifically because I've never made it a secret that I do NOT trust police and I'm extremely burnt out on the Biggie/Tupac's death considering I wasn't a fan of either of them.  He told me that it talked about some interesting parts of hip hop crime and that there was only one chapter on Biggie and Tupac.  Indeed, he was right. This book delved into the Jam Master Jay killing, along with the criminal issues of Murder Inc., Young Jeezy, Jay-Z, Diddy, 50 Cent, J. Lo, Lil' Kim, Foxxy Brown, Suge Knight, Snoop, Game, Dr. Dre, etc., in addition to the murders of Freaky Tah, Tupac, Biggie, and more.  It was interesting to read about the details that I did not hear in these cases, such as cops handcuffing J. Lo to the top of the cage.  That's a prime example of why I feel the way I feel about cops. Was it really necessary to do that?  In that aspect, I can feel this book. There were many times when Parker complained about how the NYPD handled witnesses and innocent victims as though they were criminals, and he hit it right on the head by explaining that if the NYPD continues to be as domineering and violent as they have been to get people to talk, the streets and crime will continue to be on different playing fields with no intentions of a fair game.  Cons: 1) I'll admit that even as a professional copyeditor, I can look over errors. It's much safer to let at least two pairs of eyes read a manuscript than one. I'm hoping that's what happened with this book. No copyeditor will catch every single error, but about a quarter through this book, I was seeing so many errors to the point where I wondered was it copyedited at all?  Commas out of place, words in the wrong order, past tense with present tense, and other glaring errors that should've been caught by even the most casual reader.  2) I was so tired of this man patting himself on the back.  It was to the point where I thought he was molesting himself trying to talk about how great he was.  He kept italicizing "I" and "me" as if we didn't understand that he deserved credit for something. Then, he kept on bragging about how cops were coming to him for help because he knew about hip hop.  In mid-story, he'd start talking about how he knew something was wrong because he was so well-informed of the subject.  Okay, we get it.  If the man had just told the story and his actions, we could've come to the same conclusion without reading about you and your Hip-Hop Superman Cape.    3) Over and over again, he made idiotic statements that only cops can come to the conclusion of.  The word "accidentally" and "Amadou Diallo" should NEVER be used in the same sentence. That was flat-out intended murder; nothing accidental about it. Even though he kept saying that hip-hop was not the full reason for violence, he kept throwing out all these random examples about how they equate, without ever mentioning the fact that poverty can play a great big hand in that.  He uses examples like Kanye West to say that some rappers don't go down the same violent path, but what a drastic comparison.  Kanye West didn't live nearly the life that Snoop Doggy Dogg did and there's no way anybody is going to tell me that the neighborhood and economic gain does not play a hand in the attitudes that many "gangsters" and drug dealers have in how they view life.  This is not to say that it is right for them to be suicidal all the time, but I can't see how he couldn't understand that.  4) Throughout this whole book, he made it seem like he was one of the best cops and he seldomly talks about anything he does wrong. Even when he does, he blames it on his boss making him do it (ex. creating the hip-hop binder).  He claims he's not a drinker but consistently talks about how he doesn't remember certain places he was at because he was so drunk and having fun.  He talks about how other cops were scared but he was excited to be in drug-ridden, violent areas of Brooklyn.  That in itself concerns me.  To me, that's like saying that this cop viewed these areas like the board game Clue.  He may find it amusing that he caught the killer, but none of these killers, witnesses, and children in the area find their everyday life "fun."  It's very easy to criticize one's lifestyle when you don't have to live it on an everyday basis.  5) The man seems to have all of these answers about how the NYPD and LAPD should operate to be a more productive police force, but there was something he did in this book that only stamped the "Why I Hate Cops" attitude into just about everyone who mildly thought it before.  There's a huge no-snitch policy in poverty-stricken areas (and quite a few middle-income areas too, the more the police act a fool)!  Every single time he talked about issues within criminal cases, he gave out real names of witnesses, as well as ALL the information they gave. He talked about buying them food and how so many were cooperative in telling their stories.  But the information he gave may not have all been accessible to the public.  Some of the killers got off free, and I don't even understand why he put so much information about what the victims said in this book.  Does he think all criminals don't read?  All they need is ONE friend to say that their name was mentioned in the book, and there's a whole new set of problems for these witnesses.  Victims and witnesses risk their lives telling stories about what has happened around them, and a cop documenting all the details in the book does not make anybody feel safer to go running to the cops. If anything, it makes them more hesitant.  Just about every chapter, I was shaking my head and thinking "He can't help it. He's a cop.  He doesn't understand how goofy it is to document this type of information."  Even if it's someone who hasn't been in a situation where they have to be a witness, a cop repeatedly bothering you can work a person's nerves to the point where they don't want to help you simply because they don't like YOU.  I went to a high school a block away from a police station and was harrassed ALL the time for unexplainable reasons, even as a reasonably innocent teenage girl.  It's going to take more than the no-snitch rule to get people to help in these communities. Cops have to pretty much change their WHOLE attitude before a lot of these people will trust them.  6) He speculates on how hip-hop is becoming organized crime and how Jay-Z and 50 Cent have marketing deals. I don't even understand this comparison.  It's not like these were dudes fresh off the street who walked in rapping and got gymshoes.  They both had to fight their way to the top for these companies to even pay attention to them.  Yes, they were both drug dealers IN THE PAST. So what?  Is every marketing company supposed to look at their background, ignore the fact that they are legit now, and not do business with them? If that's the case, America wouldn't have survived this long. This country was created from thieves and slaveowners.  If Wall Street can get rich, so can hip-hop.  Parker talks about how most Fortune 500 companies wouldn't do business with people with this background.  I hate to break it to this dude, but if companies weren't going to get rich off of criminals, America wouldn't be one of the most powerful countries that it is now off of FREE labor and the attitude "well, it's all in the past now."    As I figured, I didn't like this book and it didn't improve my opinion on cops, but when he wasn't talking about how great he was, I did find out some missing information that the media has screwed up in their daily reports+books
CONSPIRACY.  No such thing according to this author. Let's remove it from the Dictionary+N+This book is incredible!  This author "poo-poos" any idea of Conspiracy as if it's in our deep inner mind.  Just notice he equates it with "Paranoid".  Does he think Bin Laden and his gang "conspired"?  Well if you read one of Mr. Pipes other books, he certainly believes that, so I guess we can say he's paranoid.  Conspiracies most likely are natural and normal, an abscence of conspiracy would be contrary to how individuals, nations and institutions work.  Mr. Pipes ought to know that well.  He's a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, an organization which was founded by J.P. Morgan and has ties to the Federal Reserve Bank, which is a private bank: not Federal but a cabal of private bankers serving their own best interests.  You can't join the CFR on your own--you must be invited! It's a club of the elite, by the elite for the elite. Every high ranking member of the Bush Admin is CFR: Hayden, Bush, Cheney, Rice, Rumsfeld, Powell, Paulson, Snow, etc, etc, also so is Ms. Clinton and many other ruling Democrats. Is this a coincidence, hardly! Compare Mr. Pipes book to Tim Carney's "The Big Ripoff", recently hosted on CSPAN book reviews and available on Amzaon.  Tim gets close to the target by seeing the symptoms. Mr. Pipes writing of this book is highly suspect.  One has to question his motives.  It's like the Big Bad Wolf writing a book:  How to Raise Chickens in a Hen House and Keep Them Safe. You would be better reading G. Edward Griffin's book: Creature from Jekyll Island-a second look at the Federal Reserve.    +books
wonderful, imaginative+P+My five-year-old son loves this book.  The first time, I read it out loud to him and his sister.  He has read it alone several times since then.  I think the writing is right on his level - he has tackled tougher books but not gone back to them like this one - and it is long enough that he doesn't finish it in fifteen minutes.  The story sounds to me just like something a kid would think of - for example, how Elmer crossed the river full of crocodiles.   I also asked my son what he liked about it, and he said, "Dragons."  He might have given a longer answer if he hadn't been busy reading the book at the time+books
It's Worth Reading+P+If you have questions about being a gay or bisexual teen, this book has the answers. It's informative, yet interesting and has some great pics too! Check it out! Read it! Live it+books
A good book on fencing+P+This is one of the best books on fencing writen by an American. It's major weakness is that it often   attempts to teach both foil and epee and the same time . The author does address modern fencing , a subject often ingored. This book is good for the person that knows how to fence and wants some pointers; not a good read for beginners . A good book but  kept me wanting more, for example the author tells nothing of how she took up the sport and what it's done for her. Close only 4 of 5 stars+books
The WORST self-hypnosis book.+N+I own a large collection of hypnosis books and this one has to be the most lame, poorly written and uninformative book on this subject I have come across. If you are a hippy-dippy new age moron this book is for you, but if  you are looking for  a real book on hypnosis, avoid this book or waste your  money. Nuff said+books
Wake me up when it's over+N+I LOVED The Inferno, so I approached this book with the enthusiasm of a gourmand at an all-you-can-eat buffet.  Sadly, the bread turned out to be stale, the steak overdone and the desserts moldy. Okay. Now that I've run that metaphor into the ground, let's talk about Vita Nuova.  I found it to be pretty darn tedious and highly melodramatic.  The prose is self-indulgent and dry; the poetry, while slightly better, falls into the same camp.  You just want to say to the guy--get a life!  At several points during the book, Dante's fellow townspeople mock him because of his constant waterworks and woe-is-me-ing. I sympathized with them, found myself laughing at this whiny, timid little man.  Dante, as he portrays himself in this book, is a bore, a sniveling, spoiled child. +books
Could have been good, but it wasn't.+N+The story-line is OK, even though some unlikely coincidences occur.  BUT, the writing is very amateurish and full of grammatical, punctuation, and syntax errors (among others).  It was like slogging through quicksand to read it.  The book must have been self-published because no editor would have let it go out with all the errors.  A very good editor could make this an OK book, though not nearly the quality of Susan Kay's.  Don't buy it unless you are a Phantom of the Opera collector and just must have everything published+books
Disappointing Collection of Magazine and Book Quotes+N+First off, there are 356 entries in this book, not 366 like the cover and title indicate.  That huge and glaringly obvious mistake is representative of the lack of attention paid to the rest of the book.  &quot;Everyday Mind&quot; is a disappointing collection of out-of-context excerpts from magazine articles and book snippets.   There is not even one original entry in the whole book.  The content is quite light for anyone really interested in Buddhist thought, let alone anyone interested in really improving their lives.  I wasted fifteen bucks on this one+books

The pictures detail everything from each step of refurbishing a sailboat, including what tools to use and how to use them.

Whether your re-doing a sailboat or not, I would highly recommend this to anybody who's into boating.+books
disappointed!+N+I'm so glad I only got this book out of the library.  I would want my money back if I had paid for it!  Granted I am only  trying my first recipe from it now (Linzer Roll Cookies), but the directions are contradictory and full of errors.  For instance, the recipe tells you to roll the dough out into one 10 inch square and in the next sentences tell you what to do with the rectangles of dough.  So we go from one square to some rectangles.  So Nick, which one is it supposed to be? I guess I'll just have to wing it!  Hello, isn't a professional pastry chef supposed to know his stuff?

Abby shows of that she is so cool. In the book she tries to help her mom and sister ajust to Stoneybrook. Abby should have never joined the club. Kristy is right when she says that Abby is a bad baby-sitter. Abby should have never joined the club+books
Declassified Data from our Time+P+When I was in high school in 1960 the United States launched the first Discoverer satelite was launched. It was, of course, launched for purely peaceful, scientific purposes.   This book talks about the CORONA project which had the public cover name 'Discoverer.'   Years later I was selling high-tech equipment to the Government. The buyers were organizations with initials like N-PIC and NRO. Even the initials were secret, and the names National Photographic Interpretation Center and National Reconnaissance Office were so far into the 'black' that they weren't even mentioned.   This book says that the information in it has been cleared for release by these very organizations.   Once in a meeting someone mentioned 'Keyhole.' I said, "What." He shut up really quickly.   Most of this book consists of pages that were marked "TOP SECRET - TALENT - KEYHOLE." TALENT is imagery. KEYHOLE is the camera system (designed by Polaroid).   I later was talking to an Air Force pilot who had been transferred to Hawaii. when he got there he asked another officer what the deal was. He was told, "Oh, we fly out to a spot in the pacific and we use a hook system on the plane to catch a parachute out of the air that is lowering a capsule that has been ejected from a satellite up in space." What a wise ass, he thought until he found out that that was what they were really doing.   The CORONA images are now available for anyone to use. But now their biggest utility is to examine what has happened over the forty five years since they were taken.   This book is the first released on CORONA, it consists of the original reports written at the time, declassified but with certain parts blacked out. It's the original scoop+books
Sentidos agudos+P+Cosmos no es un libro rápido, lleno de situaciones que nos ponen  a pasar hojas y hojas de manera frenética. Cosmos es un libro acerca de la vida, de cómo entendernos, de observar cada cosa como si en cada imagen, cada olor, cada movimiento encontraramos el sentido verdadero de vivir. Es un libro lento pero rico en descripciones. Y es cierto lo que dice la reseña digitial, este libro tiene su lado surrealista. No es una novela en donde pasarán mil cosas, las cosas pasarán en usted si le llega a gustar el libro.+books
Not for Album 2.0+N+Bought this book as package recommended by AMAZON.  It is NOT for Adobe Photoshop Album 2.0.   Many changes have been made to Album 2.0 and this book has many inconsistencies not usable in the new program.  I highly recommend Michael Slater's book on Album 2.0-it is up to date and useful.   I returned this book today+books
The Proponents of PostModernism are Excrutiatingly Overrated+N+I have great respect for Charles Jencks as an architect, and as a critic of art relating to such. Therefore the book should be retitled, What is Postmodern Architecture? Or what is everything about Post-Modernism except  the art? The main focus seems to be on the industrial world which created  the art, rather then the art. Seems hardly revolutionary or even relevant  since everyone and their brother and sister has written on that subject  since 1820. I was hoping for something which would address the art, but I  was sorely disappointed. The constant focus on the world around the  buildings of postmodernism dragged and was inebriatingly dull (It got to  the point where the author was forced to contradict himself to make the  book interesting). The focus of Postmoderism was once architecture,  however, now the focus has shifted, it seems everyone except the academics  know this. Not only was his sections on art and literature stupid, but  incorrect, and blunderingly light. I expected more from Jencks, being the  great mind of the century he was. If you want to know anything helpful and  relevant pretaining to Post Modernism today, do not read this book. But hey  if you want to know about your father's post modernism, read this book+books
A  look into the impossible life of a preacher's wife....+P+An unhappily married and mistreated preacher's wife lets us in on the sad and lonely existence of a pastor's wife.  King did a good job of showing how pastors' wives are expected to please and perform at inhuman levels.  I wasn't happy with the ending (Dean's tawrdriness seemed out of character); I wish she could have left on her own terms, rather than being basically run out of town.  Her behavior lessened the reader's pleasure in seeing pious, ambitious, Ben's probable career nomination nix.  Augusta's manic personality was enjoyable and needed for the story; sometimes it takes a "big" personality to help us break old habits and get out of ruts and she did that for Dean.  A good read, just wish Dean could have finally told Ben and the church what she really thought of them, left town, and then figured out her relationship with Maddox... in an above-board kind of way.  Dean deserved to leave that snake pit with her head held high, not running with her tail between her legs+books
A Great Compliment to Kingston's &quot;The Woman Warrior&quot;+P+After reading Kingston's &quot;The Woman Warrior,&quot; I thought I'd read &quot;China Men.&quot;  I am not disapointed at all.  &quot;China Men&quot; is an excellent biographical work that recounts the lives of Chinese men in America from the 1840s to the Vietnam War.  Although Kingston uses as much  Chinese myth in this book as she does in &quot;The Woman Warrior,&quot; she  apparently decided to keep the mythology and biography more separated.   Even so, Kingston's stories and the way in which she recounts them is  absolutely splendid+books
A treasury of trucks for the beginning reader+P+&quot;Trucks,&quot; by Byron Barton, is an educational treat for the youngest readers. A very simple text accompanies colorful illustrations of many kinds of trucks. We see a garbage truck, delivery truck, tow truck, dump truck, cement mixer, and more. The artwork of this book is distinctive: the crisp illustrations have an almost mathematical precision to them, and are rich in contrasting colors. I give the book an enthusiastic recommendation+books
Night  Hoops+N+This book was a great book. I like the way Trent was helped by Nick. One thing I didn't like was the violence. I am not a big fan of basketball, or any other sport, but this book really touched me. I would recommend this book to anyone even if they aren't a lover of sports. That is what I thought about Night Hoops.      Sunny Block+books
Boy the Way Glenn Miller Played, books that are a hit today!+P+I thought while reading this book how thoroughly done it was. I thought about how much I loved All in the Family, how connected I felt to each character, how I identified with Mike, Gloria, Edith and even Archie. How real it was to me. When a piece of literature, brings back all of those feelings and memories, it is something to remember. Pictures, stories, Archie-isms and an episode guide are just a few things that make up this book. I recommend it to all Archie Bunker fans and haters alike. This book is one of the best documentations of characters you love to hate, that I have ever come across+books
FABULOUS+P+This really is a comprehensive, excellent instruction book and it is appropriate for people at all levels of cake decorating experience.  Toba Garrett covers everything from start to finish and at the end of each lesson she provides a self-quiz that will help you see how much you have learned, practice each technique and make sure you understand the terminology that goes with this exciting career/hobby.  I teach cake decorating at a local craft store and I own my own cake decorating business and Toba is an inspiration and my absolute favorite cake decorator.  If you want to learn anything about the art of cake decorating, this book is worth the price!  It could replace all the other cake books in my library all at once.  Oh - and the recipes are fabulous too!  Try the chocolate fudge cake recipe if you like chocolate cake, it's OUT OF THIS WORLD.  I want to mention that the recipes have the ingredient measurements for both a 5-6 quart mixer and a 20 quart mixer for those who are starting a kitchen with bigger equipment.+books
Moderate Considerative+N+This book 'The Resurrection'..The 'Title is a way off does not specify &quot;The Resurrection of 'Whom' what, who? quite misleading in the 'Title' This book contains a paraphrase legalistic view of someone?  by the name of  Jesus Christ (inside the book) who is this someone? Popularistic  homogenous personality of the AD;s Era, who resurrected in an abnormal  manner, irrational or modelistic super natural sensationalism?  This  unequal phenomenon of th AD ERA DOES not quite interpret an invasion of  ethiologial or methodolagical interpretation in any form or manner.   Precautiosly, Hank H. (The author) of this 'strange' book, depicts a man  2thous years ago who was a 'super-artistic' human walking around the earth  realm announcing and denouncing his own fate, then 'resurrects' from the  dead?  quite symbolic and quite 'phenomenal', however, Hank H. (The  author) does not quite inscripts the powers involving this 'Super-Natural'  Heroes of the other decades and eras AD.  The author needs more research  inside this man called 'Jesus-Christ', how a super-natural power 'Raised'  him and made him a 'normal' human again.  This Jesus Christ, Hank portrays,  has to have an incontrollable humanistic inside his 'human' potentials,  physically, a human-being' after burial cannot in any form or manner  resurrect from the grave.  Hank H. (The author) does not specify in detail  'Who resurrected him' Was the power on the skies, ..like Imentioned in my  first review 'THE BIG BANG? &quot; RESURRECTED this powerful created who  inhabitted the 'Earth' 2 thous years ago?  If Hank analyzes this  'resurrection' power inside the 'Einstein' Theory' or the 'Carl Sagan'  Theory ' Relativity, and 'rational - irrational ' Theory of both  Scientists.  Hank H. (The author) imiplies about the 'myths' and other man  made theories...Hank H. (The author) ..does not quite interprets the nature  of this 'human' called Jesus Christ in the humanistic form..or other/  super-=natural-instics of a super-naturla power involved.End******+books

London from 1660-1670+P+I stumbled on Liza Picard's books quite by chance. After looking at the publishing date in some of the books it is apparent some of them have been around for several years. I am now recommending them to anyone and everyone and I am so glad I stumbled across the first one I read  on a rainy afternoon, lonely and far away from home. I have now read them all.  As soon as you start to read the book it becomes apparent that the author is passionate about her subject and wants the reader to enjoy the reading experience as much as she has in the writing of it. Liza Picard presents an enthralling picture of how life in London was really lived in the 1600s: the houses and streets, gardens and parks, cooking, clothes and jewellery, cosmetics, hairdressing, housework, laundry and shopping, medicine and dentistry, sex, education, hobbies, etiquette, law and crime, religion and popular beliefs. To anyone who has not read the author's books perhaps these subjects seem boring and mundane, but they are written about with such knowledge and wit that they literally come to life in the readers imagination.  Liza Picard was born in 1927. She read law and qualified as a barrister but did not practice. Quite where she gleaned all this information from I am not sure. That it was a labour of love is obvious to anyone who reads her books and I for one am grateful+books
Bias, resentment, and confsion+N+Two quotes from the book:  "Patents reflect human arrogance ..." and "Patents also reflect the arrogance of western civilization ...".  These two sweeping generalities are unjustifiable and inexplicable yet they are the basis for the book.  This book is of no use to anyone who understands intellectual property, patents, copyrights, trade secrets or other forms of original creation deserving of legal protection+books
One sided view.+N+As expected, anything coming from Victor Ostrovsky will be negative and against Israel. The book is filled with real events, which the author dramatically changed and turned Israel responsible for them. No wonder this book is banned in Israel. In fact, because of the ban, many people believe that this book has true accounts of Mossad activities. True, the book gets interesting, but the author's motive to run down the Israel for everything happening around the world spoils it. This book is a perfect example of blaming a country and its intelligence agency for your own mistakes. I absolutely agree with J. A Magill's review, this book has no credible source of information, except the fact that Ostrovsky once worked for Mossad.   Vindictiveness is the word behind this book. Absolutely one sided, and nothing to prove what author says. All I can say is that I want my money and most importantly my time back. I doubt if I can have either.+books
angry+N+THIS BOOK IS FAR TOO BIASED TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY.

SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY A BOOK ABOUT MAYOR GUILIANI THAT IS WRITEN BY SOMEONE WHO PRESENTS MORE BALANCE+books
informative and precise instructions+P+This book was such a relief because it covered classroom discipline, from the beginning, without talking down to the reader. The chapters are organized so that you can implement the methods right away, in a useful sequence without becoming overwhelmed. You need to read this book if you fear you are a pushover in the classroom. I have used these methods in a multicultural classroom with more than half of my students as non-native English speakers. It really works! There is a tremendous feeling of respect between everyone in the classroom. I was especially pleased with the effect on one of my students who was severely abused as a child and who grew up very untrusting in foster homes, etc. In September, he was violent with himself and with other children, striking classroom objects or people when he was angry. Other teachers are amazed at how much he has changed since the beginning of the school year. I owe so much to the advice in this book+books

WHAT BOOK ARE YOU READING?+P+Apparently the reviewer from PW read a different book from the one Lisa Rogak wrote.... Her book on Atkins was funny, juicy,informative... and really a tribute to the man who was so ahead of his time.   I loved the different faces of Atkins revealed, the surprising and sometimes a little shocking facets of the man's personality.  Also, revealing the fact that Atkins was a proponent of alternative medicine left me wanting to know more.   Atkins was a risk taker, a man who dared to be different.   Rogak gives us all the personal tidbits that existed behind the public persona who was that man.  I love the diet... and I love Rogak's book! +books
Another ploy to ensure that the layman must hire an attorney+N+I agree that this book is absolutely essential to lawschool or practicing law. That's what makes even more horrible!!! I studied English all through college, and relied on the MLA handbook, which is great!! Why can't the Bluebook people hire the MLA people to come up with a legal reference book that is well-organized and not utterly confusing!! Of course, this review is worthless, b/c if you plan on going to lawschool, working as a paralegal, or doing anything legal, the bluebook is a must have, and there's no way getting around it+books
Not even close to history just plain fiction!+N+Stenger believes Hill is guilty from the start and tries to make him out to be a common criminal. While Joe is no choir boy the truth is stranger than fiction. Little is known of Hill's buddy Otto Applequist, but over the years more facts have been uncovered about this man's fascinating life. Not the ... son of a Swedish minister but one of many sons of a working class family. An immigrant who becomes disillusioned with the American dream after he finds, instead of streets paved with gold, only forests, mines, docks, and streets covered with the blood of his fellow workers. Not a romantic bandit, but a revolutionary who chose to use his death sentence to bring the cause of labor to the forefront. If you want a balanced book about him get Joe Hill by Gibbs Smith.

Anti-muslim seems to be OK+N+Having enjoyed Kellerman's Delaware stories,I happened on this one and was stunned by his cultural/racial bias.  It is astounding how often the Arabs, Turks, Bedouins, Muslims are described as "sweat stained," "filthy," "lazy" and "shiftless."  The idiot Arab boy and the dishonest shop keepers are typical.  The Israelis are always industrious, clean, eager to do the job. The "good" Arab detective, Mahoud, isn't even Muslim--he's Christian!  The description of the 1947 and 1967 wars are difficult to consume, knowing the complexity of the issues then.  This was an old (1988) book, and one hopes that Kellerman will stick to his detective/psychologist stories+books

Nitty Gritty but not much!+N+I am disappointed with this cookbook. I was looking for a basic cookbook to explain times and techniques to cook standard items in a Toaster Oven.

First+P+A lot of character exploration in this collection.  A lot of the X-Men being the young people they are have started to couple up.  There are also some breaks with Colossus and Nightcrawler having problems after Colossus has come out.  The major storyling is the Phoenix.  Is Jean Grey the Phoenix?  I can't say without spoiling it, but it does not follow the path of the traditional Marvel Universe.  Overall it was a good story, the artwork is a but uneven at times, but it works for the most part+books
Bright new scholarship based on intellectual tradition+P+Scholarship in the field of Islamic studies has improved steadily since the 1970's. Whereas Islam was often viewed as a monolith, and from an orientalist perspective, current scholarship has been more informed of the realities of the religion. Unfortunately recent popular media and writing has tended to reverse this positive trend and outlook. Many books, articles and classes are back to portraying Islam and Muslims in terms of divisive characterizations. Muslims tend to be viewed as "fundamentalist", modernist or opposed to Western civilization. The spiritual dimension of the religion, Sufism, is often viewed as outside the core foundations of the religion. The divisive perceptions by both Muslims and non-Muslims reflect some actual situations but do not contribute to much needed mutual understanding. The authors of this work demonstrate that only with an integrated approach, which includes the depth of the spiritual tradition within Islam, may issues in the current crisis be addressed and lasting solutions found.  What is unique about this book is that it explains the current situation and crisis we are facing (particularly as a result of the terrible tragedy of September 11th) based on a more complete understanding of the Islamic intellectual tradition. This tradition always refers back to a metaphysical, meta-historical Reality defined not only by Islamic revelation, but by all the world's great religious traditions. It would be easier to simply state positive aspects of Islam without rising to the challenge of addressing the specific problems, issues and negative images the Western media has confronted Muslims with. It is even more rare to see these issues addressed from the perspective of a long-standing intellectual tradition based on sacred texts and writings of eminent figures in the past and modern eras. The authors in this book manage to incorporate sound scholarship and critical analysis using the resources of the spiritual and intellectual tradition of Islam to address the difficult questions now challenging the Islamic view. The book edited by Joseph Lumbard includes: a foreword by Seyyed Hossein Nasr; a Qur'anic analysis of the term "Jihad" by David Dakake; a study of the decline of knowledge based on the Islamic intellectual tradition of "Ihsan" by Joseph Lumbard;  a response to modern secularism by Fuad Naeem; an analysis of the spirit of jihad by Reza Shah-Kazemi; a view of the roots of modern misconceptions of Islam by Ibrahim Kalin; an application of game theory as a strategy for dealing with the politics of terrorism by Waleed El-Ansary; a Muslim response to the social, economic and political impacts of globalization by Ejaz Akram; and a perspective on the effects of fanaticism on the Muslim community by T. J. Winter. This work constitutes a refreshing collection of articles that succeed in stimulating the debate on the current world crisis and in taking account of the problems from an integral approach to Islam+books
Excellent reading+P+I read the true story of the My Lia Massacre when it first came out, and then knew why when we came back we were called baby killers. Now that I have read this book on My Lia I wonder how they let something like that happen and what makes me mad is that nothing more has been done about the people that done it all. I personelly think that all the people that took part should be put in jail and left there, but other then that it was an excellent book to read+books
Typical Robert Smith mush+N+This book is pretty lame compared to other texts on the market today. The YI Jin Jing description is terrible and of no use what so ever. Neither is the Shaolin 5 animals forms that are discribed in minute proportions. I don't care what the history of the manuscripts are, this book offers no definitive information. It is very vague and elementary, a lot like Smith's other books. The fighting methods shown are a poor representation of Shaolin skills. The true essence of Shaolin is beyond any manuscript, let alone a hoax manuscrpit from Taiwan, which is the inspiration for this book+books
great book!+P+an analysis of this sort was sorely needed. this book is factual in addition to being cute. i would highly recommend it to anyone+books
Examines the chronic and pervasive ambivalence towards women+P+In Women &amp; Christianity, educator and author Mary Malone examines the chronic and pervasive ambivalence towards women throughout the first thousand years of Christianity. While women from the very beginnings of the Christian Church have been graced, called, inspired, and canonized down through the centuries, they have also been excluded and even oppressed by clergy and other leaders of the Christian community who cited scripture and Christian tradition (including Apocryphal and Gnostic literatures) as the justifying source of their discrimination. Very highly recommended for women's studies and students of Christian history from 30 C.E. to 1002 C.E. (the &quot;Dateline&quot; section is particularly noteworthy), Women &amp; Christianity showcases both the persistent courage and the innovative quality of women's lives, as well as offering a critical analysis of previous conventional histories. The clear emphasis throughout is the enduring importance of women's contributions to the creation of Western culture in general, and the evolving Christian community in particular+books
Several Problems+N+I've seen several mentions of grainy photos, and they are grainy, however that is the least of the problems with this book.  First of all many of the figures have been traced out from the background the photo was taken with and pasted onto a plain white background, causing multiple problems, like persepctive and flat or squished body surfaces where the models were originally sitting or lying on something.  The "cutting and pasting" is sloppily done, and in many of the photos the tips of toes and fingers have been cut off, very annoying.  Secondly, there are several photographs that take up two pages...but this is a bound book, so the entire center of the body is not visible, and because a portion is in the binding even the countour is not usable.  In additon to the two page layouts, there are multiple other figures that fall directly in the center of the book, and are rendered unusable by the binding.  The only thing I can figure is that this was originally a spiral bound book, or had pull out pages, like a magazine centerfold.  I can't imagine someone would intentionally publish a book with such an awful layout.  Lastly, some of the "motion" figures are cheats.  One in particular is clearly a man laying on something propped up on a pillow, but he has been cut and pasted as though it were an upright pose...maybe that explains why so many found the poses "unatural".  That wouldn't be a big deal if the book wasn't called "The Figure In Motion", and was maybe titled "Some Figures In Motion, and Some Sedentary But Turned To Appear As Though They Were In Motion."  Couldn't give it no stars, as I will use some of the photos, but my money could most certainly have been better spent+books
Pointless and Misleading+N+If you want to consult the First Folio, get a facsimile.  Freeman's "editions" are not only pointless, they are profoundly misleading: only someone who was completely ignorant about Jacobean book-production could possibly suppose that the vagaries of F1 represent a meticulous adherence to Shakespeare's intentions.  In the matter of lineation, for example, Charlton Hinman long ago showed that compositors would divide their copy into lines to suit their own convenience -- i.e. to take up more or less space as the process of "casting off" required+books
A Good Book is Hard to Find+N+I picked up this O'Conner book because every once in awhile I hear about her being "the definitive voice of the South" or "very disturbing" - I like disturbing and since I'm not overly familiar with the South, the definitive voice of it seems a good place to start.  But I just couldn't do it.  I read maybe 4 stories before I had to put it down for good.  I found the characterizations sophomoric and, well -- I suspect the overt, unsubtle, judgemental observations constantly being offered were snide parody, read in this day of self-consciousness they read like pandering to the lowest common denominator.  Timely, maybe.  Timeless, it's not+books
A Classical If a Bit Dated Primer on Knife Fighting+P+First off, I recommend that you buy this book if you are at all interested in knife fighting. This is one of the first and one of the classical American books on knife fighting. It covers all of the basic techniques  that American forces have used for many, many years. At the same time, this  book is a little short on techniques, and it is entirely absent the escrima  techniques that have become very popular over the past couple of decades.  If you don't look at this book as everything for everybody, you will find  it a very good buy and not be disappointed. On the other hand, if you're  looking for the snappiest way to open and close your balisong, you're going  to have to look elsewhere, as this book was written before that time+books
Return of Charles Johnson+P+Mr. Gilkerson has written something wonderful here; even 50 pages in and at the tender age of 40+ I was enjoying the ride. This is one fun book to read, and aside from some of the nautical terms used, seems very appropriate for an early adolescent. Also, as a hobby pirate historian, I can fully appreciate what the author has done in providing a background for the history of piracy in his narrative. He has provided this history in what I consider to be a very engaging manner; a manner that will drag the younger reader along entertainingly and educationally. Three hundred plus pages later, I was just as engaged as the author wound up his narrative.  There are only a couple of minor things that could have been included to help the young reader: 1) a glossary of terms, 2) a labeled image of ship rigging, and 3) a collected bibliography for further reading. In the end, those are fairly minor points when considered in the context of the overall entertainment value of the book. My hearty thanks to William Gilkerson for entertaining me with this splendid tale. P-+books
Uncle Isaac  Asimov Tells It As It Is. +N+After the 1700s, this play fell into obscurity. It was later revived in the mid 1900s. Its period of obscurity does not surprise me. Believe me, I am a champion for Shakespeare's underrated "Timon of Athens" and "Coriolanus." I honestly TRIED to like this play, but I was forced to concur with the great Isaac Asimov who said: "Though it ends happily and is therefore technically a comedy, it lacks a carefree fun and happiness of the previous comedies. it is, indeed, rather an unpleasant play..." Well, onto the play. We meet the widowed Countess, her son Bertram, and the elder Lafew. We learn that the king is ill and quite possibly terminal. Possibly, Helena's father could have cured the king, but alas, he is dead. The Countess gives Bertram some advice that is not so far from the advice Polonius gave Ophelia. (Though the bumbling Polonius ends up being easier to like!) Helena loves Bertram, but feels beneath him and contemplates virginity. One comical moment is when Parolles reveals that in a way, virginity is a form of vain self love. Later, Helena cures the king, and Helena asks for Bertram as a husband. Now this is where I have a problem. Bertram is made out to be a villain. But how can we possibly not sympathize with him? Maybe Helena deserves something for saving the king, but does she really have the right to impose marriage on someone who doesn't like her? Well, Bertram is forced to go through with the marriage, but he quickly decides to help Florence against Siena. Poor Parolles who knows this forced marriage was unethical is constantly made a subject of ridicule in this play. This is where I have another problem. Rather than the clever misunderstandings of "The Comedy of Errors," the clever marital confrontations and errors in "Midsummer Night's Dream," or the comical and clever passages from Jaques in "As You Like It," the comedy in "All's Well That Ends Well" is reduced to the lowest possible form. (Flat out ridicule! It is interesting that in the word ridicule, we have the letters for cruel, but I am digressing.) In one decent elemenet of comedy, Bertram makes it clear that he would rather go to war than lie with his wife. (And perhaps in time, Bertram can appeal to the king to release him from this marriage. It wouldn't be unheard of.) One interesting thing is that Bertram remains honorable in the sense that he does not 'ravish' Helena. He doesn't love her, and therefore will not engage in sex. It is rather repulsive on his mother's part how she fails to understand the situation. Even if she was on Helena's side, she might AT LEAST understand Bertram's frustration in that he did not consent to the marriage. (And possibly try to at least talk things over in hopes of coming to a peaceful solution.) But no. She just rants and raves. Later the Countess reads a letter from Helena stating that she will leave so Bertram can come home from the war. This throws Bertram's mother into yet another rage on Helena's behalf, and perhaps moves the reader into sympathy with Helena. THAT IS, UNTIL OUR GOOD OLD UNCLE ISAAC ASIMOV points out the hypocrisy of Helena: "Helena is not quite as unselfish as she is presenting herself to be. She does not go to the shrine at all but sneaks off to Florence in disguise as a pilgrim hoping that she may yet return her reluctant husband." Well, onward. In Florence, Helena meets with Diana (whom Bertram loves). And Helena thinks she can trick Bertram into making her pregnant. We then have the cruel practical joke on Parolles where he is blindfolded and threatened to reveal military secrets (to friendly forces of course) or else. Perhaps even Shakespeare felt bad over this scene as he has Parolles say: "Who can not be crushed with a plot?" (4.3.340). We also see Bertram try to win the affections of Diana. Diana of course feels nothing for Bertram. But again, the hypocrisy of the play is prevalent. If we accept the fact that Bertram should respect Diana's wishes that she doesn't love him, how do we account for the fact that Helena imposed an unwanted marriage on Bertram? But of course Diana consents to meet Bertram and of course it will really be Helena who meets him. But even tricking Bertram into getting her pregnant is not enough. Helena decides to throw a sympathy party for herself by spreading the word of her death back home. Now in "Much Ado About Nothing," Hero had a valid excuse for staging her death. She was humiliated and disgraced in front of several people for something she was totally innocent of. But Helena was the one who imposed an unwanted marriage on Bertram, and she still wants a sympathy party. One redeeming element of the play is that Lafew shows some sympathy for the disgraced Parolles and offers him a job. And of course, in the end Bertram feels bad over Helena's staged death and is happy to see her alive again. Helena may very well be the Britney Spears of Shakespeare's characters.+books
Look for Teach Yourself Catalan+N+In recent years, Routledge has gone from consistently producing excellent language courses to producing some excellent courses and some bad courses. Unfortunately, Colloquial Catalan is a prime example of the very worst Colloquial courses.   The main error in this course is the fact that it's exceptionally limited. After completing some of the more extensive Colloquial courses, you will master the grammar of the language and have a solid basic vocabulary. Colloquial courses like Colloquial Italian, Colloquial Czech, Colloquial Albanian or Colloquial Icelandic list over 2000 words. The average Colloquial courses list 1000-1500 words. In sharp contrast, Colloquial Catalan doesn't even reach 600 words!   In my opinion, the Colloquial courses are often a better option than Teach Yourself courses, but that's not the case with Catalan. Teach Yourself Catalan will teach you more than twice as much as Colloquial Catalan.+books
incredibly good writing+P+this is an amazing, beautifully written first novel. not only is the plot first rate, the characters are drawn with a rare degree of perception and even compassion. the relationships are realistic and change as the investigation proceeds and when the murderer is caught. the dialogue is natural, and reflects the personality of the character speaking.  there is also wonderful humor in the descriptions and the dialogue.  this is the mystery to lend the friends who think mysteries are shallow, formulaic and generally not worth wasting time on. this is the book to lend to friends who love good writing.   i can't wait for the next+books
PCOS+P+This book has given my daughter and me more info on this disease than any doctor has been able to do.  The book has given my daughter encouragement that she can live with this syndrome and that she can make her life better if she takes the metformin and gets her body moving.  The info on food has helped sooooooo much.  Thank you for this book!!!!!+books
Not the "building web-site guide" you may look for+N+If you are that "Dummy" who wants to know how to build a web-site, then this is not the book for you. It tells you hardly how to build, it tells more about links which can help you making your web-site look more cool. You have to have some HTML cq Dreamweaver experience to understand the context of what the writer wants to clarify. By reading the book and going through the enclosed CD Rom with ty-out software, I soon came to the conclusion that the title of the book is somewhat misleading. See comments above why.  If you are that "Dummy" who has not a single thread of  knowledge about building web-sites, then do NOT buy this book. Not giving it 1 star (but I was close), there are some interesting chapters in this reference giude, but typing what you want to have inside your web-site (links and related web-sites with loads of info what comprises around 50% of the book). you will get the same information from any search engine.  Recommendation: concentrate first on a book, that teaches you the basic HTML-programming language, continue then with either a Dreamweaver/FrontPage manual. You're much better off..+books
excelent+P+I'm a beginner reader and this book was very easy to read and I'm not saying that it is boring in fact its descriptions are very suggestive, the narrative is very very astonishing and the end of the story couldn't be more   elegant+books
The Scoop on Dish+P+All of the books in the Dish series are AWESOME! They are about best friends forming a cooking club. The three original best friends, the twins Molly and Amanda and their friend Shawn take cooking classes in Park Terrace. They find out that a girl in their school and grade who they don't know really well, Peichi is also taking classes. Then, there is Natasha Ross, who spread a mean rumor abot the twins and Shawn, is taking cooking classes too. The twins Peichi, Shawn AND Natasha all become best friends. Then a boy named Justin McElroy, who Amanda thinks is pretty cute moves to the neighborhood. Their family has an electrical fire in their kitchen and to help them, the Chef Girls cook a week's worth of dinners for them because they have to stay in an apartment. After this job they come up with a great idea to form a cooking business. Will their business take off like a rocket?+books
Perhaps, just rhetoric!+N+Despite the praise heaped on this text, I can't help feeling that Bernard Faure has been constructing the 'straw men' other readers have spotted. It is by no means certain that the Ch'an (Zen) tradition has functioned as Faure suggests. Why, for instance, set up the 'anti-scriptural'  argument - only to concede - on proper investigation, that it is a myth? There are enough commentaries - on the sutras, by Zen monks, to make this sort of thing seem pointless. Sorry, but lets place trust in those deluded masters of old - and stay unenlightened, Faure style.+books
Wow!+P+Until now, I'd not been not all that familiar or appreciative of graphic novels. I gave this book a try because I was interested in its Jewish content.  After reading it, I was surprised to learn that this was the first graphic novel in book form and that Will Eisner was a pioneer in his field.    Eisner's drawings are  magnificent, and the book's content noteworthy and familiar.  I like the idea of taking everyday characters and telling a story with pictures and dialogue.  I especially like the tidbits of history that preceed each chapter and the amazing detail in the sketches of the tenement buildings and the scenery (especially the falling rain). Perhaps comics are not just for kids after all+books
VSM for the Office+P+I found this to be a good book on translating the tools of manufacturing to an office environment. It communicates all of the basics that are required.  I've attended one of this consulting group's manufacturing classes.  I found them to be dead on.  I like the way they handled the accounting/cost/metric relationship to lean production.  Basically, the current accounting standards will cause you to do things in opposition to what lean principles will have you do.  In some other office scenarios, I think this more traditional approach will not have all the pieces or tools required.  I work in an industry where order entry is significantly more complex than the examples presented, a much higher degree of interaction with other players is required, and rework loops are significant part of the process (customer driven rework).  ANITECH has an approach that tracks the information flow surrounding the work process, while applying the same lean techniques that are presented in this book.    Tracking the information flow provides an opportunity to sort out, automate, and lean out that information flow.  There is tremendous leverage in this concept+books
Couldn't finish it.+N+I first read Clavell's Shogun when I was twelve years and it sparked within me a life long interest in East-Asian culture. In many ways he helped bring me to Japan, where I have lived for a total of eight years. However after reading his works for many years, I was quite bored with Gaijin, which I never finished. I perused through the book looking for interesting points but found little. His messages in his other works were repetitive in this one. Amongst them are his criticisms of western culture through an Asian perspective. I grew tired of hearing how sexually repressed white-anglo-saxon-protestants are when compared to their Asian counter-parts, and thought my reading time was too precious to sit through another lengthy reading of how East meets West. Some of my friends in Japan have read Gaijin and liked it; but after owing so much to this writer, I am sorry that I could not say more of this work.+books
AN AWSOME BOOK!!!!!!+P+This must be read ferom all ages. Im on the third book now and they are the best. Its got it all magic, dragons, unicorns, betrayel, and friendships.Its an Awesome Triology!!!!!! Read them you will love them+books
Dutch Oven Use and Care, Plus Varied Recipes+P+This is a five-star classic, and for the price can't be beat.  The author covers selection, use and maintenace of Dutch ovens, as well as providing a good mix of recipe types (fish, poultry, deserts, etc.).  I especially recommend the fish and rice recipe+books
Solid Spooky Laymon+P+Richard Laymon is one of those writers that some people have a hard time admitting that they REALLY like. Having read over a dozen of his novels I have to agree with Dean Koontz that you will have a "good time with anything he writes." Although his plot lines tend to push the limits of probability, the strength of his characters add a verismilitude to his novels that have you wanting to believe this could happen. That is the basic foundation of this book which has six college students chasing after buried treasure in the wilderness after receiving some very accurate and very spooky instructions from a Ouija board. Now there are very few authors that could take such an almost lame premise like this a build a very suspenseful novel around it- but Laymon, as usual, pulls it off. If you are looking for a fast-moving, in your face, page-turning novel and are somewhat willing to suspend your beliefs for a while then you will enjoy this book. I guess reading Laymon is like riding a roller coaster, you just pay your money, hang on and enjoy the ride+books
May Be Verging on Formulaic+N+Persia Vanderbilt has grown tiresome for me.  The endless self-absorbtion of the character has worn out its welcome.  More emphasis on the town, her auntie, the shop and the plot would be welcome.  Less emphasis on how toned and fit Persia is, and much less description about what she's wearing might make me come back.  As much as I hate to say it, it was a struggle to get through the book.+books
Disappointing!+N+I've read several other mysteries by this author, but was quite disappointed in this one. The writing seemed "padded"--i.e. paragraph after paragraph that did nothing to advance the plot.   The plot itself was okay, but certainly not exceptional, and some of it wasn't even believable. For example,although there was some explanation for the seemingly total imcompetence by the local police department (understaffing), the idea that even a rookie (much less the police chief) would miss so many of the pertinent and obvious clues that an untrained 32 yr old shop owner ferreted out seems more than a little farfetched.  Another part of the plot that strained even the most willing suspension of disbelief is the handling of the dv incidents by the police. Again, only the most incompetent of professionals would have handled the case they way it was.  All in all, this novel was not one I'd recommend to anyone.+books
Excellent--very knowledgeable+P+This is an excellent book!  I used it in one of my classes in college.  It really gives insight into daily details of the lives of the Etruscans, which also helps you to understand the Romans better.  Very well written, by good scholars+books
The Crumbling Wall Against Tyranny: A/K/A The United States +P+The Crumbling Wall against Tyranny is the most interesting book that I've ever seen on the American Revolution, our sytem of government, and the current state of affairs. The book is authorative, yet humorous at times. Complicated legal concepts are explained in terms that I, a mere high school/trade school grad, can easily understand. I was particularly impressed with the authors ability to relate experiences of growing up in a small town to our national government(Chapters 8&9). I, too, grew up in such a small town, albeit my small town was 500 miles away and considerably colder, yet it seemed the same as my little town. In summary, I was very impressed with "The  Crumbling Wall Against Tyranny" and I would recommend it to any one interested in American government especialy the parents of students who are studying or will be studying the constituion.+books
Embarrassingly Inept Writing+N+Although Vestal establishes his credibility as a researcher, it is not enough to research well; one must also be a writer, and Vestal's embarrassing attempts to mimic Bridger's speech is a travesty.  From inane, trite cliches to ungrammatical and unmusical diction, it is clear that Vestal needed a much stronger editor.  Recommended only for those who can ignore the non-standard grammar and abyssmal writing or who are interested only in the research+books
Bad book for lots of money+N+There is little to respect about this book.  If you are looking for factual, organized and informed writing, look elsewhere.  I found the conjecture regarding Tesla being an Atlantean engineer, incarnate; and the co-founder (with Marconi) of a city of the future in South America -- well I'm sorry, but who needs this.  On the other hand, the photos of UFOs were as good as any I have seen.  On the plus side, the copied material (Tesla letters, patents and court transcripts) was interesting+books
Faith in McCrone:  McCroneianity+N+Science, properly understood, means proving a hyphothesis and having that proof replicated by one's peers.  This was not done with McCrone's "proof" obtained only by McCrone using his "instruments".  No verification by reputable laboratories equals taking McCrone's "proof" as a matter of faith ..........in McCrone.  A fool's choice+books
Not what I expected+N+Perhaps I didn't read the description closely enough.  This book is a historical text, not applicable to today's surveying.+books
Not his best...+N+Basically this book is an elaborate defense of promiscuity and hedonism.  I have liked his other books in the past (Skinny Legs and All is one of my all-time favorites) but this one didn't have enough insight to adequately place the elements of the story within a greater understanding of the world around us (usually one the greatest things about his writing.+books
Highly recommended+P+This book really made me take a step back and look at my life and how I have wasted a lot of it with meaningless task that I don't even enjoy. It teaches you to pay attention and devote your time to the things that really matter. I highly recommend this book for anyone who like myself leads a hurried life or feels like they have forgotten what brings them joy. Buy this book!+books
Poorly Executed Text; Good Collection of Color Plates+N+An abundance of full-color plates and numerous black-and-white photographs made this book worth the modest price.  The text is awkward. It sounds as if English is not the author's first language and certain elements of carelessness in the writing suggest that the author was more concerned with the manuscript deadline than scholarship. Picasso's own words, appearing as blocked quotes in the margins are not dated, nor sources given. The reader is not able to chronologically trace the change in philosophy reflected in his words. The text also suffers from an inordinate number of typographical errors. Walther's poorly disguised gut reaction of disgust in describing some of Picasso's work may reflect the reaction his early critics felt in viewing some of his paintings. Walther uses words such as &quot;horror,&quot; &quot;grotesque,&quot; &quot;misshapen,&quot; and &quot;ugly,&quot; at one point writing, &quot;Picasso wanted to destroy absolutely everything.&quot+books
SO GOOD, IT SHOULD BE ILLEGAL!!!+P+IMPRESS YOUR FRIENDS.  INTIMIDATE YOUR ENEMIES.  BUY THIS BOOK!!!  I must echo the sentiments of an earlier reviewer.  I was a returning college student in my late twenties.  I had to take several remedial courses just to bring myself up to speed in math and English.  Between the techniques in this book (mainly Mind Mapping), meditation and subliminal memory tapes (the last two are not in this book) I finished my second semester with three A's and two B's.  Also, I made the Deans list.    The section on speed-reading was so great; College was the first time in my entire life that I could read so fast I actually had time to go over my answers and check for any possible errors.  I rarely found any.    If you are in a SUPER HURRY to improve your memory for testing, I suggest skipping to the Mind Map section.  However, you really should go back when you have more time and read the WHOLE BOOK!!+books
Encourage Children, Students and Selves to be the very best+P+Ordinary Children, Extraordinary Teachers has inspired me to be a better parent and teacher to my two children. Marva first let the children know that she cared about them and that she would not let them fail even when  the other schools have washed their hands of the child. It was as if I were  a student in Marva's class. I was so encourage to first, complete the book,  I could not put it down, as I read I would practice the techniques on my  children, for example my six grade son was still struggling with his  multiplcations facts, he had a test to complete 100 problems in 4 min. I  call my son a scholar and had him practice over and over the same test.   each practice test he got better and better, he passed the test and felt  really proud.he is bringing his C's to B's and his B's to A's.  I learned  you have to meet the child where he is.  Thank you Marva for your care,  concern, inspiration and motivation. and keep teaching and writing+books
for the coffee table, not the kitchen+N+I got this as a gift from my son, since I had just visited Tuscany last year and loved the food. I am an experienced gourmet cook. This book needed a test kitchen in the worst way. I tried two recipes: one for polenta (as basic as pasta) and a Garbanzo bean bread. The proportions for both were totally wrong. The polenta balled up in the pan, and the "flat bread" was like a soft egg dish. I checked in one of my favorite chef cookbooks (Sheila Lukins of Silver Palate fame) and the proportions were very different for the polenta. the other recipe couldn't find anywhere. I'm donating this one to the library for the Friends of the Library sale.+books
Read this book or you will be eaten!+P+Is this book exciting ?  Does a bear sh*t in the woods ?  This book, a couple of bears (and a couple of beers) is all one needs for some great reedin'.  It kept me occupied while I await the release of Fox's &quot;When Animals Attack IV&quot;.  It kept me up all night, and I ain't takin' Viagra neither+books
Here we go again.+N+You almost feel sorry for the author.  Draped in acclaim, among the books of the year, it can only mean that any reader approaches this book with high expectations.  More worrying, the author's information on the back of the book talks mosly about all the prizes he won at Harvard.  And that's what the book feels like, a very well executed assignment.  It's written in a fairly convincing pidgin English, but when it wavers, it breaks the rhythm and the belief.  It also feels entirely formulaic.  It goes through the trials of dehumanisation (murder, rape, sodomy etc) but it never engages the reader's sympathy, just occasional admiration.  There's no doubt that Iweala can write.  I hope he dares to produce something fresh that doesn't feel borrowed from another culture, another life.  I'd risk buying another book of his+books
Somewhat interesting but hardly a "must-read"+N+"The Hitler Book", a posthumous biography of Hitler personally prepared for Stalin, is of interest only as a historical curiosity and for the insight it provides into the strange political dynamics of postwar Stalinist Russia. Interestingly enough, and contrary to press reports and the claims of the researchers in question, this book was not recently "discovered" by a couple of German scholars digging around the Russian archives. David Irving used this dossier in the 1960s when writing his magnificent "Hitler's War", which is_the_book I would recommend for those interested in a life of Hitler, particularly his years in power.  Based on the interrogations of Otto Guensche and Heinz Linge (Hitler's SS adjutant and manservant respectively), this book covers most of the major events of Hitler's life more or less accurately, but should not be taken as an authoritative work of history. It's a gossipy, biographical caricature based on both public knowledge and the torture-induced testimonies of a butler and an aide. That's not to say that Guensche's and Linge's testimony shouldn't be trusted, but two low-level witnesses do not a biography make and, in any case, their information should be compared with what they freely told Western authors, like David Irving and James O'Donnell, after their decade in Soviet captivity. This book reveals no new information, and is also marred by the fact that it shamelessly panders to the prejudices and paranoia of its very important audience of one: Josef Stalin. It obviously makes no mention of the Ribbentrop/Molotov Pact and subsequent Soviet expansion into Poland, Finland, Romania and the Baltic states, and certainly doesn't deal with Soviet agressive intentions toward Germany or the reasons for the disasters of 1941. Its portrait of Hitler sticks to the wartime propaganda line, showing him as a feral, rug-chewing, cowardly maniac. And while the Soviet Union did indeed bear the brunt of the fighting against Nazi Germany, this book seriously downplays the Anglo-American contribution, deprecates the bravery and effectiveness of their troops and even accuses the Western Allies of trying to negotiate a separate peace with Hitler and of not bombing armaments factories whose weapons they knew would be used exclusively against the Soviets. It's an interesting look into the dark maze of Stalinist psychology, but is not the source to consult for a legitimate Hitler biography+books
DO NOT BELIEVE OTHER REVIEWS!!!+N+I read all the reviews before purchasing this book and they are totally wrong!! This is by far the WORST cookbook I ever bought.  For starters the cover is the end of the color pages. The whole thing is mono-tone with no color what-so-ever.  The recipes consist of items that an everyday working mom couldnt find or afford!  Like swordfish, lamb, tampanade sauce, kasseri and gorgonzola cheese, etc. to name a few. Of all the recipes, I think I would maybe only try 3 and they are similar recipes to those I can get off the internet for FREE.  In addition  Several recipes have a sauce that goes with it and it never gives the sauce recipe on the same page.  In fact it doesnt even tell you where to find the recipe.  At the end of the book you discover the "sauces"  finally... I am re-listing this book which I got less than 8 hours ago to resell...Horrible..+books
UGH!+N+I hated this book.  This family has two girls, Racie and Jaynell.  Rachie is a girly-girl and Jaynell is a tomboy.  It seems like the only person who loves her is her grandpa.  Her parents are just plain crazy.  Mama repedily whipped Racie with a flyswatter because she ate a sugar cookie and the dad threatens to "tear up" their hides each time they do something he does not like.  Once Jaynell said something out of turn and he grabed her shirt collar, nearly strangleing her, and pushed her rougly to her mama and forced her to apologize. Then Jaynell says that she will flench everytime she sees a flyswatter and she gets really scared when mama uses it on Racie.  Her parents are just crazy.  Then grandpa dies.  Dad becomes even angrier and mama just looses it.  I understand that sparking fear in a child's eye is a good thing.  Children should be afraid of their parents-but this is crazy.  Racie just ate one cookie and from that one mistake she recives a thrashing that is talked about in two paragraphs.  Jaynell says that she could hear the repeted blows and it just sounded aweful.  These people were crazy.  This book is crazy+books
Buckland DE-jargonises the field of AI+P+This book IS my Masters thesis. I built a multi layered combative system driven wholly by neural networks evolved using genetic algorithms. The learning of agents was unsupervised and they existed collaboratively and adversarily. If all of this made no sense, dont worry! Read this book and it will. The book covers these techniques (except for multi layered architectures) to a level understood by anyone with a basic knowledge of C. It totally demystifies NNs and GAs. Other books on these subjects actually put you off the entire concepts of AI by feeding you fear and confusion. I have completed the book and have read it numerous times. It is going to be invaluable for my development of PHd stuff - his writing introduces areas for potential research. Im would definately buy other books from this author. I hope he covers other areas of AI soon and puts 'em into print. Be jaysus, tis mighty I tell ya!!+books
Very good edition+P+As you would expect from Oxford, this is a very well done edition of the play, with a comprehensive introduction (though I wished for a little more theatre history myself) that covers the major issues in this "problem" comedy (though it is not nearly so much a problem play as, say, Troilus and Cressida, in fact being much closer in many ways to Measure for Measure), several textual appendices, an index, useful textual- and foot-notes (there seem to be a great many phrasings in this play that need explanation--a result of revision?), and two of Shakespeare's direct sources in Erasmus and Painter.  There were a few points when I disagreed with the interpreations offered in the footnotes, but overall, the apparatus is excellent.  As for the play itself, the main action concerns the efforts of Helen to recapture her husband Bertram, who is given to her by the King as a reward for curing his fistula.  He does not think she, as a physician's daughter, is worthy of his station and flees to the wars in Italy without consumating the marriage.  The comic subplot involves the exposure of the cowardice of his companion, Paroles.  Helen evnetually fulfills the requirements Bertram sets out in a letter--to obtain his ring and bear a child by him--through a bed trick, and the play ends where it began, with the King (echoes of Lear?) offering Diana, who helped in the trick, her choice of husband.   Overall, a very good edition of a less popular play.        +books
Batchi-guu! (^-^)+P+I haven't read the book but I assume it's the same as the movie. I first saw this movie in Japan and I fell in love with it and all following Miyazaki movies. He has a gift when it comes to story telling. The characters, with Jiji the black cat as my favorite, are unforgettable+books
Christian Cronyism+N+&quot;This is absolutely laughable, Would you trust a book on Christianity by Abdul bin Majeed the 2nd ?   Or one on Capitalist free thinking by Carl Marx+books
I liked the first edition better+N+Some things are best left as they were. The first edition was simple to read, and did not seem to be trying to be the most complete guide to cruising ever written. Unfortunately I loaned my copy to a friend and it never came back so I ordered a new copy and got this one. I think the author has tried to write about too many subjects and include too many different ideas- it comes off  like a compendium of conflicting ideas. Also this book more than the previous edition shows the author has a pretty big budget. Not the best guide for those of us with more limited funds+books
A very readable introduction+P+I picked up this book to find out a bit more about this branch of Christianity, and by and large I was not disappointed. This is an eminently readable introduction to Anglicanism, from its founding in the 16th century to the present day. It covers all the major developments, and gives a brief background for each. It is particularly useful for anyone who wishes to put the present controversies shaking the Anglican communion in a historical context, and the last chapter of the book is devoted to these controversies.   The only shortcoming of the book is its overly historical and political point of view. I would have appreciated a more extensive insight into the Anglican theology. Overall, however, this is a wonderful little book and I highly recommend it.+books
Natural vs Unnatural+N+I see that some people were helped by this book.  I would not recommend this book for someone who has not experienced sex.  The advice to virgins was disgusting.  The writers say that the sexual act is not natural and that people need help enjoying it.  The writer also suggests techniques of preparation for the virgin the month before that most assuredly would either lead to depending on yourself for fulfillment or it would train a young lady to not be responsive.  I thought the book was sick.  It turns women into an object of function. It also talks about men being 100% head of the household and women being 100% submissive.  The authors are a husband and wife but I can't hear a woman's voice anywhere in this book.  The cover is pretty so she probably had something to do with that. I'm sure she submitted completely to him in the writing of this book and that is why it is completely clinical and even crude+books
Amara awakenes+P+The late Richard Laymon's book "To Wake the Dead" is about a mummy who comes to life to terrorize the Los Angeles community that is housing the Egyptian exibit.  Also there is a strong side story about people being kidnapped and held as sex slaves somewhere.  That is actually the creepier story.  But the mummy one is really a dandy too.  The Mummy story is not my favorite horror theme (and I did not like the Stephen Sommers/Brenden Frasier movies, either), but then it had never been presented like this.  Actually a lot of it was very H.P. Lovecraft influenced; mentioning of the evil ancient snake god Set, the museum is named after Charles Ward, starting to see the resemeblence?  The characters were less than I expected.  After reading "In the Dark" I thought he would have some richly developed characters; but I guess there were just too many to juggle to give them all proper time to mature.  There were the kidnap victims, the blind woman, the runaway teenagers, the hedonist Egyptian, the museum curator and her boyfriend; I guess too many subplots and not really tied up effeciently.  But this is still a great book, and I think any fan of horror will enjoy it+books
shallow, lazy and narcissistic memoir+N+From Woolf to Dickens and Carlyle to a wonderful essay on Little Black Sambo's author to Josephine Baker, Phylis Rose's objects of consideration have always been profoundly significant. We used to read her books because  they told us about the world. But now we learn only about Phyllis Rose's  world, and it isn't the least bit appealing, or interesting or even  revelatory. Rose has lost her way completely. Her early books expressed a  kind of insight, albeit in a perpetually arrogant and smug tone, that is  completely absent from this book. An author in search of a subject. Perhaps  this is her last book+books
I wasted my money on this one :(                  +N+I hate to leave such a negative review, but it seems all this author did was take the information presented in "The E-Myth" by Michael Gerber, and make it her own (and in an amateurish way to boot!).  If you are a business owner who really wants to learn how to create systems so your company runs without you, then get the latest edition of "The E-Myth Revisited" and let a true pro show you the way+books
Auntie Mame, Low Country Style+P+Here is a book to hold to your heart, it is that good. And before I even get to the fun, lively and irresistible plot, let me just say that we know on page one that Miss Lavinia, our own Low Country Auntie Mame, has passed away. And yet at the end, when we have finished getting to know her and attend her death and funeral, I was crying like a baby. And I don't cry at books!!  The plot to this book is true to Dotty Frank's genre: displaced Low Country gal comes home, gets mesmerized, and slowly regains her roots. In this case, the woman is Caroline Wimbley Levine, married to a cold and smug psychiatrist, Richard, and living in equally cold luxury in New York with their beloved son Eric.  When Caroline hears from her brother Trip that their mother, Lavinia, is losing her marbles and must be put in assisted living, Caroline grabs Eric and goes home for what she thinks will be for a few days. And there she is caught up in the gullah magic; the Low Country mystique (in which I thoroughly believe, thanks to Dotty's wonderful books) and a chance to become, once again, the "real" Caroline.  This might be the best of the four books Dotty Frank has so-far written. I cannot praise it highly enough. Grab it and lose yourself in a truly wonderful read+books
Not age appropriate.  Shocking.+N+I purchased this for my 11 year old son.  I am so thankful that I read this book before giving it to him or going straight to discussing it.  The pictures are hand drawn but graphic.  Far too much detail for the target audience. Kids need to know about sexuality but they don't need to know EVERYTHING before they are even teen-agers.  I would be upset to find this in a school library.  This book definitely needs to be used with supervision.

If you are interested in Early American Furniture, read this+P+Having been sent this book as a present by a friend in the US, I felt I must tell others just what a treasure trove it is. It has been written by  someone who not only obviously loves his subject, but who has written a  clear, easy-to-read amd well-illustrated guide for those of us who have  developed an interest in early American furniture but who lacked expertise.  It also tells you how to care for furniture. I can't recommend it highly  enough+books
An Amazing Book - one of Kosinski's Best+P+I have read most of Kosinski's works of fiction, and I must say that this is one of my favorites.  It is more along the lines of Steps or The Cockpit, but it is a little more experimental in its story telling.  There  are different narrators, both first and third person, who tell the story of  a very wealthy young man's journey through life.  Like the characters in  Steps and The Cockpit, Waylen is very self absorbed and often performs  horrifying acts of revenge on those who get in his way.  I would recommend  this book to anyone+books
Really not that great+N+Unless you are an advertising industry buff or somehow admire Mary Wells Lawrence this book is just average.  There are a few interesting spots but for the most part she is just talking herself up+books
Poorly written...interesting material rendered boring+N+The feeling the book gave me was one of disjointed-ness, I couldn't  fully submerge myself into the book because it didn't seem like the writer could decide how she wanted to present the material. It read like conjecture for a lot of it, with "could", "would have" , and it also read like a lecture given by a professor, at the same time, it was too conversational, and in all just poorly written. The material was interesting enough, and her conjectures intriguing, it was just the presentation that was faulty. It would also have been better if she could have given logic for her conjectures, as it is...she would have done better to have written the book as a fiction novel, and it would have carried better.+books
Painful But Essential Reading+P+Sundown Towns goes a long way towards explaining the US' pervasive racial problems by examining a phenomenon many white people had thought dead and gone: sundown towns (cities or neighborhoods where racial minorities were not allowed to live or even be present after dark).    It would be tempting to dismiss Loewen's research as merely anecdotal, but obviously more concrete evidence can rarely be found: even the most racist townships took care to mask their anti-black and minority rules through sleight of hand and legal double speak, and city limit signs that used to warn minorities not to linger after dark have now mostly vanished, but there is simply too much material here to ignore.  And the honest reader will have to admit that much of what Loewen writes about sounds familiar.  We've all heard excuses for why blacks and whites tend to live separately: the blacks like it that way, they don't care about good schools and nice houses, etc, etc.  We've also heard plenty of "blame the victim" stories indicating that it is black laziness and racial inferiority that prevents them from moving to the suburbs.  And we've all heard other whites making disparaging comments about minorities and not protested, thus becoming tacitly complicit.  Reading some of Loewen's stories about the race riots and lynchings that helped create the sundown towns, reminded me of some of the histories of the Nazi rise to power in Germany during the 1920s and 1930s. So many of the methods for dealing with despised groups, whether whites against blacks or Nazis against Jews, are terrifyingly similar: economic boycotts, terror bombings, sabotage, etc.  And the language used by so called "white patriots" warning of the threat posed by black migration to an area reminded me of nothing so much as the screams of Osama bin Laden and his followers for the annihilation of the West to defend Islam. (Yet another reminder that we humans are all indeed "brothers under the skin!")    I already knew I lived near one of the more infamous sundown counties, but as I read this book I began to suspect that some other communities and neighborhoods I'm familiar with may be sundown as well, and that's something I intend to investigate for myself.  As a Southerner with long ancestral roots in the former slave owning regions, I have always been aware of the dark history of race relations there.  It was with some surprise (and I hope a forgiveable amount of satisfaction at seeing such hypocrisy revealed at long last) that I read that sundown towns were and are far more pervasive in the North and West, and that the Southern states, far from being exceptions to a rule of general tolerance, were merely the most prominent examples of nationwide intolerance.    Loewen provides some excellent reasons for why sundown towns are bad for their residents as well as the people they keep out:  the cultural aridity, the fostering of racial stereotyping, the unwillingness to try new ideas or customs. And he ably restates what the Supreme Court said in the Brown decision back in 1954: segregation has a degrading, scarring emotional and physical toll that makes it completely unacceptable.    Lowewen suggests some interesting methods for confronting and hopefully putting an end to the sundown phenomenon, including a call for a Residents' Rights Act that I fear will take a seismic shift in national politics to ever have a chance of becoming law. (To start with we'd need a President and Vice-President who don't live in sundown towns themselves!) More realistic suggestions emphasize action by concerned volunteers willing to research and ask the difficult questions needed to shock the many out of their complacency.  This isn't a comfortable book to read, but it may come to be considered as important as Gunnar Myrdal's An American Dilemma in helping Americans deal with the quandaries of creating a truly equal multi-racial society +books
Trying to finish it+N+This book is very hard to read.  Excruciatingly painful in dull plot as well as the overly wordy text.  I am going to finish it as an exercise  in tenacity+books
Reader's Digest a Reliable Source+P+This book by Reader's Digest is wonderful.  I know some basic needlepoint and embroidery, but this book also has instructions for knitting and crocheting, of which I know little about.  Also has section on rug-making!  Very comprehensive and easy to follow+books
Intersectionality as described by Maya Angelou+P+In her autobiographical novel, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, Maya Angelou recounts her life story as a young, keenly intelligent but insecure black girl in the South during the 1930s and California during the 1940s. The book conveys the difficulties associated with the mixture of racial and gender discrimination endured by a southern black girl, though, and this is perhaps the most fundamental theme explored in her autobiography. The intersectionality of race and gender is a pivotal thread of Angelou's theme, where more than one type of subjugation results in a multiple burden for the victim. Overall, I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings is a powerful, stirring account of the intersectionality of race and gender regarding black women. Though segregation had been officially declared null and void, many of the Southern states were steeped in racist tendencies that further multiplied the gender inequality that exposed black women to a multi-faceted oppression. Peiss, Hine, Terborg-Penn, Bederman, et. al. all examine threads of this intersectionality, and in discussing these threads, one can draw a distinct comparison between anti-black, anti-black women sentiment and Angelou's personal experiences. As a girl, Angelou believed her gender to be a limiting factor. She considered herself to be unheroic, and incapable of achieving spectacular feats like the boys in her comic books. In the narrative, being female for Angelou is just as trying as being black, and she struggled with the double burden, rather than embracing it. However, as more and more black women slowly overcame their troubles as a result of the overwhelming intersectionality of the time, so did Angelou. The novel ended with hope because she bucks the stereotype to become the first black female streetcar conductor. Angelou's spike in confidence and belief in her ability reflects the gradual evolution of black women's race and gender after decades of imprisonment, and foreshadows a future of activism, struggle for respect and eventual victory in those regards.+books
a bad book+N+This book was a reading for my 3rd grade daughter.  I have no idea how or why this book EVER won an award, unless it was for being the most boring yet deppressing book ever written.  And the illustrations were just as sad+books
great book! +P+This book has a great variety of martini recipes - I'm usually a fan of basic dirty martinis, but there are so many options for interesting drinks in here, I'm looking forward to branching out and trying them all. It's a great book to use if you're throwing a party, since there are drinks in every color, flavor, and for every season. So far I've tried the Pineapple Champagne martini, which was really good. The book also has a ton of really beautiful photos.+books
Review - Understanding Financial Statements, 6th Ed.+N+The presentation of the content assumes that the reader has some knowledge of this content area and at times leaves him/her confused as to what was discussed, making it difficult to understand. Examples that are used are often incomplete and do not provide a complete picture of how statements are generated. As someone who has no knowledge or experience in this area, I found it to be frustrating to read and comprehend the information. Not a good choice if you are a novice. Too bad I could not give it zero stars+books
Great resource - don't confuse it though+P+This book is a great resource for all aspiring competitive runners.  However, don't confuse this book with Glover's other book - which is more for beginning and non-competitive runners.  There is a lot of overlap between the two books, so there is not much point in buying both.  However, I can see a beginner outgrowing the beginner book and wanting the extra info that the "Competitive" handbook can provide.  Both are great.+books
The ultimate suppliment+P+I found that this book contained everything I've been looking for: great new weapons, very useful feats, and lots of new prestige classes (I always wanted to make a Samurai!) &quot;Sword and Fist&quot; also contains various buildings which can be useful for DMs to base, for instance, a guard tower or an elf house on.  If there is anything I was dissapointed about was how little information there was on chariots, but then, the book would also be better a thousand pages long.  FIVE STARS+books

Presents God as weak, vulnerable, and limited+N+In a time when reformed theology is on the rise, Pinnock and his co-authors seek to provide an Arminian understanding of Scripture.  However, the book is strewn with problems.  The authors claim that God's love trumps other attributes like holiness and justice, but they give no scriptural support.  Their arguments are based simply on our western sense of fairness.  They make such appeals because they believe our moral sense reflects truth, instead of recognizing our fallen nature.  In addition, they advocate "making peace with the culture of modernity" (27).  Instead of letting God's Word shape our thinking, they allow our lost culture to shape our view of God's Word.    The result is a presentation of a weak, helpless God.  In fact, the authors state "it is more important for God to give himself to his creation than to rule the world or to be worshipped" (35).  He is described not as ruling, but as "limited by humanity" (40) , vulnerable, and "the defenseless superior power" (175).  The book has weak, humanistic argumentation, little scriptural support, and a harsh tone toward those who embrace reformed views, views said to be "theologically repugnant" (84).  Do not waste your time with this book.  While there are legitimate differences between Arminian and Calvinistic views and a place for dialogue, this book does not give dialogue but instead gives unsubstantiated claims that leave you with a helpless God not in control and not worthy of worship.    In case you do not know, the editor of this book embraces the view that God does not know the future. +books

The Edgar Alan Poe of Shakespeare's  Day. +P+For those of you who saw "Shakespeare In Love," you will probably remember John Webster as the 13 year old boy who was obsessed with blood and death. John Webster's plays came out about the time William Shakespeare was putting out his final plays. Hazelton Spencer says this of John Webster: "Even Webster's most lyrical verse is preoccupied with decay and death." But if we are willing to move past this, John Webster's writing is actually quite impressive. Act 1 begins with the banishment of Count Lodovico. Interestingly, Lodovico tells of the evil Bracciano. (Why not? It would seem people of an evil nature would know each other.) And through the testimony of his judges, we are introduced to the evil behind Lodovico. We later meet the diabolical Bracciano himself. He is having an affair with his friend Flamineo's sister Vittoria. Not surprisingly, Vittoria has a nightmare about a massacre. We later see that Cornelia (the mother of Vittoria and Flamineo) does not care for them. In Act 2, we meet the Cardinal. We are allowed to respect him in that he is no flatterer. Webster then shows us the division between the diabolical Bracciano and the at least moderately virtuous Francisco. (Francisco is of course angered that his sister Isabella is being mistreated by her husband Bracciano.) But Bracciano's untainted son Giovanni breaks the tension with some comic relief. With the use of magical images, Bracciano sees his murder plot against his wife Isabella and Vittoria's husband Camillo come to pass. But Lodovico sees the death of Isabella, and he will return before long. Onto Act 3. The Cardinal suspects that Vittoria had something to do with her husband's death. We know that it was not Vittoria's fault, but how sorry can we feel for her? If she was this intimate with the diabolical Bracciano, how ignorant could she have been (unless she was very obtuse) to the evil she submitted herself to? The Cardinal sentences Vittoria to life as a nun. During the trial, Flamineo is frightened that his part in aiding the affair will come out. And Lodovico makes his return. He loved Isabella (even though she would not submit to having an affair with him), and Lodovico will avenge her. (Perhaps Webster was trying to use contrast between Isabella and Vittoria to limit our sympathy to Vittoria.) Onto Act 4. The Cardinal informs Francisco of his sister's murder. Francisco of course wants revenge. While we have no real reason to dislike the Cardinal or see him as a bad person, it is interesting that the Cardinal has a book of criminals. Can we doubt for a moment that Lodovico is listed in it? (But like Shakespeare and Dickens, Webster is really skilled at creating fully 3d characters as opposed to Hollywood heroes and villains.) Isabella's ghost appears to Francisco. (Probably to make sure Francisco will not hesitate in his revenge.) Bracciano and Vittoria meet again, and while Vittoria is reluctant, she and Bracciano marry. Act 4 ends with the Cardinal becoming Pope. After rebuking Lodovico, the Cardinal approves of him joining in Fracisco's revenge. Perhaps here, Webster is pointing out a 'terrible truth' that Hollywood can't figure out. As people, we are not 100 % good or evil. And while the cardinal is a virtuous person, he agrees to the revenge on Bracciano even to the point of employing the evil Lodovico. And while we know Lodovico is evil, we probably will applaud him if he contributes to Bracciano's comeuppance. Onto Act 5. Bracciano and Vittoria marry. Disuised, Francisco finds his way into Bracciano's territory. Well, Fracisco and Lodovico succeed in killing Bracciano. But things are not quite over. Giovanni is sad over his father's death. Vittoria (Bracciano's widow) is in charge for the moment. And Flamineo thinks he can get some money out of his sister. (Why not? He aided her in her affair. Vittoria probably has access to money now.) Bracciano's ghost appears to Flamineo foreshadowing his downfall. Interestingly, in John Webster, ghosts appear to the people who were close to them as opposed to their enemies. The play ends in the massacre of Zanche, Flamineo, and Vittoria by Lodovico. (Undoubtedly, Francisco and Lodovico wanted them dead as well to avenge Isabella.) Giovanni to some extent restores orders and Lodovico tells Giovanni that Francisco was involved. Lodovico can be punished, But what can Giovanni do to his uncle Francisco? Francisco is also a duke. Overall, its a good play, but you do have to have a tolerance for brutal scenes as well as passages preoccupied with death. +books

Excellent summary of studio casting techniques+P+This book, like McCreight's other books on working metals, divides the subject into easily digestible portions and treats each topic separately (often on a separate page) with a short discussion. Line drawings help clarify important points. The focus is on the tools, materials, and techniques of lost wax casting, but also covers sand casting, the use of flexible molds, using the services of a foundry, and other topics of concern to the studio metalsmith. It's a great reference tool if you need to look up the proper sequence to use in a particular technique, or a formula for making your own crucibles. Learning to cast almost requires hands-on instruction, and this book alone cannot provide that. But if you're already familiar with casting, it's a wonderful reference+books
Good Advice for Teens+P+I purchased this book for a niece who is almost twelve and has recently lost her mother because of a traffic accident.

Secular people will not like this book.+books

Quick, Easy, Heartwarming+P+I met Ms. Holt in ... (basis for her fictional town of Moon).  She is like her characters...down-to-earth, witty, and honest.  As a twenty-seven year old teacher, I read this novel for three reasons: its setting ... I've read her other novels and loved them, and to find new reading material for recommendation to my students.  I was not disappointed. Jaynell and her family are easy to identify with, easy to follow, and easy to love.  The story line is not difficult and the messages ring all too true!  Pick this one up, you won't stop 'till the end+books
Dissapointed+N+If you are looking to obtain a basic knowlege of web programming, then this is not the book for you. I wanted a basic guide, but the author managed to create a book that is TOO basic. Yes, I was able to get my first website up on the internet, but it doesn't DO anything. For that, I'll need to buy another book.+books
Cleansing the mental palate of political correctness+P+It is a crime that the founders of America are dismissed because they are represented as failing to meet our present PC standards of faux morality.  This terrific book takes on every PC misconception about them and sets the record straight.  While never presenting them is marble pillars of morality, the author puts all of the issues in their proper context and demonstrates clearly the intelligence, morality, and rightness of our founders.    One of the most famous of the old canards that you will still hear is that the founders only considered slaves to be 3/5 of a human being because it says so right there in the Constitution.  How sad that misunderstanding and misrepresentation is.  Because each state was given a number of representatives based upon the number of residents, the issue was whom do you count.  You have to first ask yourself whom the representatives from the slave holding states would represent.  The slaves?  Of course not!    So, if the rights of the slaves were not going to be protected, to give their slaveholders the ability to count those slaves as people and thereby become over-represented in Congress would actually work against interests of those people trapped in slavery.  Those opposing slavery wanted the slaves to remain uncounted for representation.  The slaveholders wanted them to count as a full person (does that mean the slaveholders cared about the human rights of the slaves more than the abolitionists?).  The compromise was to count them as 3/5.  However, it is essential to remember that those who wanted the slaves counted as a whole person were uninterested in the rights of those human beings and those that wanted them uncounted actually had the interests of the slaves more in mind.  Professor West also takes on the issues of property rights, who had the right to vote and why, women and their rights at the time of the revolution, poverty, and immigration.  A good and informative read.  Every student should read it as an antidote to the misinformation they get during their indoctrination at the public schools.  This book will actually aid their education and help them develop a solid understanding of what is really at stake in our country.  And it might spark some lively debate when they go to class armed with some information the teacher will likely find inconvenient or even bewildering.  One of my daughters actually had to go to the blackboard and explain the 3/5 issue carefully to the teacher and class.  The teacher commented that she had never thought of it that way before.  Which, of course, means, that she had always taught it as a political tenet rather than history. +books
First encountered as a child now enjoyed as an adult +P+Edwin Tunis' book recreating early colonial American life is one of teh best books on the subject, providing by illustration and written word a recreation of what life was like during the colonial period for early Americans showing us their homes and their technology.

House of M +P+I thought it was an interesting read, it's a trip to see all the 'Marve' heroes get what they want in life.  Spiderman a hero, Logan having his memory and the story is interesting.  If you didn't follow Avengers Disassembled I'd recommend reading that first+books
Needs Improvement+N+I'm not sure who wrote the positive reviews here, but I can tell you as a student using this book that it is among the worst I've ever been stuck with and most of my classmates seem to agree.  The concepts are made much more difficult than they should be by poor writing.  The authors jump around constantly, use new terminology at times before introducing it, and provide examples that are inadequate in helping to solve the problems at the end of the chapter.  Stylistically, the writing is very bland and sure to put you to sleep.  The first sentence of the book is "This is a book about signals and systems."  Sure, this book may cover all of the core concepts involved in signal processing, but trying to make sense of it when you don't already have a background in the subject is quite a challenge.  After reading the chapters, we were unable to solve most of the problems in the book until given the answers were given to us.  I've dealt with bad textbooks before, but this one tops them all.  Needless to say, it was very frustrating experience and I can't say I recommend this book+books
Great for Teachers!!!+P+This book is an excellent way to introduce solids, liquids, and gases.  I used it with a 3rd grade class and it was perfect+books
sherri , reader with back and neck pain+N+I got this book as a gift and i think after reading it" only if it was that easy to forget about your pain!" I think the book tells us the strong link between the mind and pain but doesn't offer anything new when it comes to solving the problem of pain through exercises which 99% of todays experts say is the best solution to back or neck pain. Invest in an updated book that tells you how to exercise anywhere+books
Clear and concise+P+I was impressed by this clear and concise guide. As an undergrad, I took a legal writing class. We had no textbook, but we could have used this one. Now, I'm in law school, where I found this book on my own. Half the work is trying to figure out what legal types are saying. Judges and lawyers could make my job easier by reading this book. As a student, I find it a good resource to help avoiding such pitfalls+books

Excellent+P+This book has something for every event in a garden.   Planting, designing, what to grow and how to grow it.

Hilarious and heartbreaking+P+Having skimmed the reviews on this site it is apparent I am not the only person who decided The World According to Garp was worth re-reading after 25 years.    The World According to Garp is ultimately about lust and its destructive nature.  If you are easily offended (Irving's novels tend to revolve around twisted sexual behaviour and Garp is no exception) you may want to avoid The World According to Garp (and pretty much everything in the Irving catalogue).    But the World According to Garp is more than a series of bizarre sexual encounters.  It is a complex, disturbing, and insightful novel. In The World According to Garp, Irving has created some of the most vivid, unique, and truly memorable characters in modern literature, not to mention some of the best lines of dialogue ever put to paper.  The World According to Garp is both hilarious and heartbreakingly poignant.   I do have to admit that I did find (as I often find with Irving's novels) that it meanders a little in the middle (I could have done with a little less on the wife-swapping relationship for example).  Even though some plot lines didn't engage me as thoroughly as others, all in all, The World According to Garp is a well written, enormously entertaining novel.  If you haven't read anything by John Irving, The World According to Garp is a great place to start.  If you read the novel years ago, its well worth reading again.+books
Couldn't Hold My Interest+N+This novel could not hold my interest.  I am an Anne Perry fan, but could not get into this book.  I couldn't really bond with any of the characters and the plot was uninteresting.   I'm really disappointed, because I was looking forward to a new series by her.  Joseph and Matthew lost their parents to murder and Joseph lost two close friends to murder, yet there didn't seem to be much emotion.  Maybe Ms. Perry tried to tell too many stories within one story.  In reviewing the book, it's hard to pin point exactly why I didn't like this book. I would skip this series and read the Pitt series.  +books
Lots of information but wordy+P+A little wordy and sometimes hard to find the main idea in each chapter. There is quite a bit of info in in the book+books
question everything+N+I would refer anyone who would take this author seriously to James Randi's comments on his behavior. He represents the modern version of the crystal ball reader and his claims should be eyed with an appropriate degree of skepticism. This would be a benign phenomenon but that his success depends on the suspension of reasoned thought on the part of those who grieve for their lost loved ones+books
I have never encountered a more perfect review book+P+I never took a psychology course in my life, but one day, for some reason or another, I decided to take the AP psychology exam. I picked up this book, read it throughly and took the tests at the back. On test day, I was literally laughing because the test was EXACTLY the material presented in the Barron's book. I breezed through effortlessly and got a 5. I would like to extend my sincere thanks to the makers of this book- i cannot tell you my appreciation, and i applaud your production of an outstanding review book. If you truly know every concept in this book, I cannot, in anyway, foresee a score less than a 5.   by the way, the tests at the back of the book are slightly more complicated than the real thing, so don't be alarmed if you miss 10 or 15...keep in mind i was laughing on test day.   thank you barron'+books
Entirely awful book+N+Great Expectations was perhaps one of the worst book ever written. I'm no Dickens' expert, but I do know a little about literature- I don't know how this even passed through the editing stage. It is slow-paced, boring, pointless, and an all-out waste of time to read. I have read challenging books with strong points like this before, and have sometimes enjoyed them,  but never have I read a book this pointless and difficult to read, with such a stupid ending.  DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY AND VALUABLE TIME ON IT!!!!!!+books
Very interesting mystery+P+This is the first Molly Blume mystery I've read, and I really enjoyed it -- enough that I will probably go back and read the earlier ones, to find out how Molly got to where she is.  As an Orthodox Jew, I'm impressed with the accuracy and understatement of Ms. Krich's depiction of modern Orthodox Jews -- it's so accurate, without painting the lifestyle as the source of all ills or the source of all happiness as a lot of other writers try to do.  I'm also looking forward to the next book.  There are some hints in this one of Molly's possible infertility, and I really hope the author delves into that -- having her deal with fertility issues and treatments rather than just providing a miraculous baby.  It's such an important topic, especially within the Orthodox world.  I would love to see how Molly deals with it+books

The Fantastic Review of the Journal+N+This was a Medieval Project in my 7th Grade Humanities class   The Summary: Catherine Called Birdy was a conflict type book. It was mostly about her pig head of a father trying to sell her to the richest man. If you like the way it sounds now you should look for a copy. It is quite interesting and has a lot of conflict in the book.  A phew funny things were when Catherine caught some objects on fire! Rating: I rated my book 2  stars because it was kind of boring. Why is because all the book was really about was Catherine's father trying to sell off to the richest man. When I did like it was when she tried to get out of each man. Who this book would be suited for:  I would recommend this book to someone who really likes conflict books in the Medieval times. Also is if you are interested in action books.+books
a cultural cornucopia!!+P+Wowsers.  This book is chock full of information--cultural, biological, historical, literary--pertaining to the human body.  Sims has done a masterful job of research; this book springs to life with allegories, allusions and myths, each connected to a particular part of the body.  Though not as humorous as Mary Roach's marvelous paean to the cadaver, _Stiff_, this book proves to be just as interesting.  If your interest is piqued by the body human, you must read this book.  Sims goes much further than what you would find on NOVA--for instance, he addresses the purpose of eyebrows and why Bram Stoker's Dracula presents the true embodiment of evil.  You'll sail through this book; although it can be a bit viscous, with perseverance, the reader will learn myriad factoids.  It is well written, thoroughly researched and will refocus the reader on the miracle that is the human form+books
A wide compilation+P+I've been looking for a book just like this one for years. It has a wide list of movies from westerns to romantic, from LA to Toledo, from great to dreadful.

Outdated Style Sheet...Doesn't Address Web Sources+N+With a 1998 copyright, one might expect this manual to be a bit outdated.   It's unfortunate, because otherwise, it's an excellent reference at a very inexpensive price.

You'd be better off using one of the many free online MLA formatting pages available on university websites. +books
Very Disappointing+N+Being an avid admirer of Manet and of the paintings in which Victorine Meurent appeared, I was happy to see a book about her.  Finally, I would be able to learn something of her and her life!  I learned that she was a Lesbian and died in 1927 and not as a destitute alcoholic as written in some rather sketchy histories of her. but that is all I learned.  The book is actually more about the author and her trying to make peace with her past and her mother than anything else.  If you want to learn about Victorine, you must find another book.  If you want to know about Eunice Lipton, this is the book for you.  Also very few facts in the book; the author puts Victorine in some situations and conversations, but these are all imaginary.  Definitely would not recommend.  Author was self-indulgent and apparently not very concerned with her subject+books
Yuk!+N+Was disappointed in the ideas.  Seemed to be more of an extension of the author's collections, than ideas for the reader. Scanned the book it and put it on the shelf, won't be one that I use as a constant reference+books
A guide for Mercury Retrograde, a handbook for life.+P+I've been surprised and enriched through reading Mercury Retrograde.  The writing is both interesting and informative, and Ms. Peay's prose are beautiful.  I purchased the book shortly before the start of Mercury Retrograde, and was amazed how frequently I had experiences that the author asserts are typical during this period.  Not only does Ms. Peay offer suggestions and advice for living during MR, but her observations can be carried through the rest of the year!+books
Excellent follow-up to "The Fred Factor"+P+With his latest release, Mark Sanborn gives you proven tools to exercise leadership -- no matter what your position or assumed stature. A fast, engaging read, this book is loaded with anecdotes and moving stories of unsung people who transcended the ordinary to accomplish great things. Everyone should adopt Mark's seven principals of leadership. "You Don't Need a Title..." is a worthwhile addition to your personal library+books
Introducing the genius+P+A very successful introduction to Picasso's work and life! Whether you just want to admire his paintings or try to learn from him, this book is a good choice. Some people don't understand Picasso and are insulted by astronomic prices of his "childish" looking paintings. In this book Ingo F. Walther sheds light on the phenomenon of this genius by presenting all the phases of painter's development that naturally resulted in the spontaneous expressions of his imagery. Or with the artist's words: "When I was as old as these children, I could draw like Raphael. But it took me a lifetime to learn to draw like them!" Thus we can follow Picasso from his youth, blue and rose periods to his invention of cubism and all the way to his late works. In addition there are chapters on his sculptures, posters and ceramics.   The book also gives a rich selection of interesting aspects of Picasso's life. An enormous publicity was haunting him as well as helping him test his brave inventions. Whatever he touched turned to gold. When he finally grew tired of publicity and decided to move from Paris to a provincial village of Ménerbes, he was given a chalet in exchange for a still life.  +books
Waiting...Point Taken+N+Waiting is a single-concept book novella confronting the difficulties of love and individual happiness in a restrictive society that is stretched to a few hundred pages. Ha Jin's personal accomplishments notwithstanding, this is one of the most overrated books I have read. National Book Award? Hmmm.   Waiting is the story of a doctor and loyal officer of the revolution, Lin, trapped in a loveless marriage. When Lin becomes passively entangled in an extramarital affair with a nurse at his hospital--Manna Wu--herself the victim of waiting for a man, he is repeatedly denied the divorce that his girlfriend demands. Everyone in Waiting waits...and waits...and waits.  The book gets its point across, and more or less works as an allegory on the Chinese communist state. It lacks any deeply interesting characterization, as Manna, and even Lin, are both all too childlike (as the author intends). The book also lacks lyricism and elegance, and unforgivable trangression for sucha  decorated piece of literature. Ha Jin's story educates, but doesn't elevate us+books

JILL SUTCLIFFE VS EDEN & CEDAR PAUL+P+I love this book, & I carried it wherever I go. Stefan Zweig is the greatest writer I ever known. His stories are so intriguing it's hard to put it down. His writing skills are so lively that even though his books are translated, they are still extraordinary works. But I must point out that in the case of "letter from an unknown woman:, Jill Sutcliffe translated & brought Stefan's work to life so much better than E & C Paul. I have the 2 translations & I have to say Jill is a much better translater in Stefan's work. I love all the stories in this book, & I hope Jill will translate more of his work. His books should be the must read books in class.+books
In a class by itself+P+This is a book unlike any other I have read.  C.S. Lewis calls MacDonald his master but I couldn't figure out why until I read this book.  Lilith is complex and stunning in its depth and imagery.  I felt awakened after I read it.  +books
Twenty year old cookbook+P+Overall this is a very useful book, largely because of the excellent photographs. Be aware, however, that place names are in the conventional form, not Pinyin. The book was written in 1984; many excellent Chinese cookbooks are more recent and reflect the current market place and field investigations+books
Potential for Greatness+N+Ms. Woodman's photographs are no different than hundreds being turned out in art classes everyday.

Mystery Better Than Sex?+P+As far as I know, Iris Johansen has only written a few books in the mystery genre but numerous of the romance variety (ok, so they may have been hot and steamy, but the mysteries have much better story lines!). In my opinion, all of these mystery tomes are fantastic and I highly recommend each and every one of them! If I had to pick a favorite one, I'd be hard pressed, as each are unique and utterly captivating. I finished LONG AFTER MIDNIGHT and loved it! Was it better than UGLY DUCKLING or FACE OF DECEPTION or THE KILLING GAME or AND THEN YOU DIE? I can't make that decision but I can tell you that each one of these kept me intrigued until the very end.  In LONG AFTER MIDNIGHT, Kate Denby a doctor of genetic research is an unwilling target for competitors who are willing to kill in order to stop the completion of a drug that will change the world. Noah Smith, of J and S Pharmaceuticals, approached Kate to go to work for him and refuses to take no for an answer. The opposition doesn't know or care that she's turned him down. When her ex-husband is killed in a car bombing right in front of her, not so soon after Noah's plant is blasted, she begins to suspect that something is wrong. This begins the story of her run in order to save not only her life, but also that of her young son, Joshua. Iris Johansen throws in a few love entanglements with Kate, Noah and Seth, Noah's best friend. Seth has the responsibility of helping to keep them safe while Noah and Kate try to finish work on RU2, the wonder drug of the future. This is enough to make a wonderful story, but Johansen doesn't stop there. She throws into the mix a diabolical creature named Ishmaru who enjoys scalping his victims. Kate defeats Ishmaru once, but he's on her trail and uses Joshua's safety to play head games with Kate.   When things seemed to level out to a steady rhythm, Johansen hurled an obstacle to create another dimension - a realm I hadn't even thought existed. I don't think you'll ever really figure out the entire plot and subplots included in this book until the very end. I thought I had everything worked out in my head and then BAM - a major zigzag was added that gave even more depth to the tale.  Iris Johansen has a unique style and you will always be thrown off by an unexpected twist in the book (usually towards the end of it). This is what makes her mysteries more enticing than most writers - she's always trying to keep the reader on his/her toes.   This is definitely a "stop light book" and you'll lose sleep trying to finish this one! An absolute must for your summer reading list! By the way, if you haven't read my definition of a stop light book, it's in my review of UGLY DUCKLING by this same author.+books
Excellent+P+This is an excellent book for actually trying to understand this difficult subject. Firstly its not bogged down with obsolete American units, though it does cover enough examples for anyone who really wants to go that way. Secondly there is a wealth of tables and properties in the index, which alone makes this book worth the money as a reference tool,(and all in simple SI units).Third, there seems to have been a determined effort at getting the message across. The one shortcoming I have found is the lack of a list of symbols/abbreviations used throughout the book (hence the lack of the fifth star rating), though they thankfully are pretty standard. My tip - if you read this very worthwhile book, jot down the symbols as they crop up then you won't waste any time having to track them down again. These comments do not apply to the identical version that comes with a software supplement (I tried it but couldnt be bothered to get up to speed with the mathcad its written with)+books
THE BARBADIAN IMMIGRANT EXPERIENCE IN BROOKLYN, NY...+P+This is a worthy and ambitious debut novel about the Barbadian immigrant experience  in Brooklyn, New York, by a little known African-American author, whose own parents emigrated from Barbados during World War I. The author herself grew up in Brooklyn. She attended Brooklyn College, graduating Phi Beta Kappa in 1953, a time when most Americans, much less a black woman, did not attend college. This drive to succeed is a testament to her Barbadian heritage.  It is from that heritage that the author drew in creating her characters and developing their rich mix of personalities, as she re-created the early  Barbadian immigrant experience in post-depression era Brooklyn. The book focuses on the Boyces, a nuclear family consisting of Silla, the ambitious, hard working, ever striving mother, Deighton,  her charming, pie-in-the-sky dreamer of a husband, and their two daughters, Ina, the older and more passive one, and Selina, the bright, rebellious one. The novel follows the fortunes of the Boyce family from the late 1930s until shortly after Word War II. It tells of their lives, their hopes, and their dreams.   The book beautifully details the experience of the early Barbadian immigrants in Brooklyn and their adjustment to their new environment. They brought with them their own ideas, their own ways of doing things, and a work ethic that is hard to beat. Quite frankly, Barbadians revitalized areas of Brooklyn that were dormant. Theirs was an almost traditional immigrant experience, but for the racism that they were to encounter here. Still, they did not allow that to stand in their way from getting ahead and going for the American dream.   This book neatly encapsulates that immigrant experience through the Boyce family. One gets a very good sense of what the experience of the Barbadian immigrant was like through the interactions of the Boyce family with others in their community, as well as with each other. While Silla Boyce typifies the Barbadian community in terms of goals and work ethic, dreams and desires, with its focus upon material acquisition, her husband, Deighton, does not.  Their separate dreams and desires conflict and act as a catalyst for a tragedy that would mar intra-familial relationships.   It is also a coming of age story, as Selina struggles to find her place in the new society and rich community her people are creating. She also struggles to find her place in the larger community, as well, stepping out of the insular one into one where racism is a factor. She is also interested in exploring her roots and heritage. Still, being who she is, the reader believes that Selina will not founder. Though Selina would hate to admit it, she is the one who is most like her mother, a fact of which she is not cognizant throughout most of the novel. She is truly her mother's daughter, in thought and deed.  This is a richly satisfying novel. The author captures the "Bajun" way of speaking in all its rich, expressive cadence. While some may find this "Bajun" dialect, which is interspersed throughout the novel, difficult to follow or distracting, it is this richness of language that give this book its very distinctive feel. Moreover, while the author may sometimes get too bogged down with overly descriptive detail, she paints a vibrant picture of a segment of society that has too long been ignored in literature.  Those who like reading about the immigrant experience will enjoy this book, as will those who are interested in discovering worthy authors that have receded from public memory. +books
Excellent Content - Unpleasant Translation+N+The book contains the complete works of Arthur Rimbaud in chronological order, in both English and French. There is an excellent short introduction to Rimbaud, along with a very nice explanation of the translation process, and the difficulties inherent in translating poetry.  Sadly, the translations presented in this volume do a grave injustice to Rimbaud. In his efforts to render an accurate contemporary translation, Mason removes nearly every vestige of poetic rhythm and rhyme from his poems. Even though my French is inadequate to enjoy Rimbaud in his original language, I found myself turning frequently to the French versions of the poems, as I tried to understand how a poet of Rimbaud's reputation could possibly write so poorly. In poem after poem, the French version was more readable than Mason's translation even though I could only understand about a third of what I read.  I ended up exchanging the book for a version translated by Paul Schmidt, which was much more readable. Ironically, Mason offers criticism of Schmidt's translation in his book.  While this book might be a worthwhile addition to the library of someone already familiar with Rimbaud, I would recommend that any person seeking an introduction to his poetry look elsewhere for a translation+books
Environmental Planning+P+I am a student in environmental planning and have found this book to be extremely useful.  It address a variey of things such as watershed, storm discharge, streamflow, etc. It really gives the reader an idea of how to design with nature+books
Script for a Made for TV Movie+N+The characters actions, motivations, and planning skills are obscure or non-existent (or a sign of mental imbalance).  2 stars for the history tidbits+books
A great read!  Bravo!+P+I haven't tried any of the recipes, but absolutely LOVED the essays in this book.  Most of them are hysterically funny.  I've never read any of Mr. Conroy's novels (though I've seen the films) -- but I certainly plan to read them now.  The book also makes me want to visit the Carolinas. +books
Herbs for Hepatitis C and the Liver+P+This is an essential book for Hep C.  I have used the herbal protocol for 8 months and brought my viral load down to 69,000 and it is still dropping.  Before I read this book, I had almost convinced myself that traditional treatment was the only way, even with its horrible side effects.  Now, I am so glad that I found this book, contacted Dry Creek Herb Farm (referenced in the book) and started my daily herb treatments.  The only side effect of the herb is that they don't taste very good, but with the results I have had they are starting to taste pretty good.  The cost is very affordable also.  Thank you Stephen Harrod Buhrner and Dry Creek Herb Farm+books
great stuff+P+I appreciated the way this book helps staff find the focus of their strengths. It's a great way to help people know what others already know about them. I highly recommend this for a staff retreat. Our only challenge was one person who was not able to use the number on the cover to access their test.+books
what a dreadful book+N+I came to this book with great anticipation. I had read its a modern American classic, a gem that is full of meaning. I thought I was in for a treat.   I worked my way through it, and wondered where, in God's name, it was going, and why I bothered reading it.   Its a huge bore, a monumental waste of time. Binx is about as dull as anyone can be, and none of the other characters are interesting. The reader goes from one boring situation to another.   Percy was trying to write about despair, and in that he was a success. The reader feels terrible despair each time another page is turned. The end of this dreadful novel cannot come quickly enough.   I realize I might well be missing what others admire. My loss, I am sure. The book failed to move me.   Its  not for everyone. I do not wish to disparage those who like it. Many regard it as great. I do not+books
You should probably look elsewhere+N+I found this book to be weird quiet frankly. Chapter 2 goes off the deep-end of designing efficient queries before you've even built a report yet. That material should have been put at the end of the book. Creating a report with the report wizard is covered in Chapter 4 but probably would have been best if it was before Chapter 3 which covers creating a report manually. I didn't find anything "Pro", as the name implies, or advanced with the book. It's a broad introductory text only. Also, it only covers using the ReportViewer control for Win Forms and not the one Web Forms. The two are similar enough but coverage of both would have been better.+books
Useless+N+I purchased this years ago and tried to read it but found it hopeless.  The style, mistakes and flat out omissions make this useless.  Wheelock's Latin is far better and worth the money for textbook as well as the workbook+books

Do not waste your money on this book+books

Horrible+N+I tried to like this book, but by page 61, I had to put it down. The main charachter, Helen, is a self-absorbed tramp and an unfit mother. She kisses people on a whim. She flirts and sleeps with anyone in town. She talks about how much she misses her daughter, who is away at camp, but I don't believe that she thinks of anyone by herself. She drops the F-bomb casually, as if that were speech becoming of a lady...which she is not. The plot is absurd. That she could be as callous and crude as she is represented to be and as popular as she is also purported to be, is impossible. This character is lewd, obstinant, selfish, childish, and impetuous. Do not pick this book up unless you admire loose women who are horrible mothers. Disgusting, and not a very funny book, either+books
It must be a guy thing+N+I found the plot of this book impossible to follow.  It contains excessively verbose descriptions with a lot of cliches. The hero almost dies twice in a row and is each time magically saved for no reason.  And there are only so many times I can read variations of "he swung his sword really hard" and "it was a really scary dragon."  The illustrations are quite beatiful, though+books
Why we use it for a graduate class+P+The one major strength of this book, from a computer science viewpoint, is its emphasis on "attack patterns".  This systemization of these issues really differentiates this book from many of its competitors (which tend to be either the latest 500 hacks or descriptions of standards).  Put simply CS is the study of algorithms, and this book fits nicely into that tradition+books
40% cliches+N+My real rating is 1.5 stars. The book won't put you to sleep, but it's not going to teach you anything you won't have known glancing through newspaper articles for a few years. Readers will learn nothing about golf if they have any acquaintence with the sport: though the closest I've ever gotten to golf in my 47 years is frequently passing by a club shop in my neighborhood, I learned almost nothing about the sport from this book save uninteresting gossip about golfers who are now no longer prominent. Feinstein makes no attempt at analysis and no attempt to fit any of what he writes into any context: what the reader gets here is a sketch of an insular world with no acknoledgment of that insularity. Hence, for any but the big golf fan who wishes cereal-box writing to pass time, the book will be useless. Bad points: besides that mentioned, the prose is (as mentioned in my title) in large measure cliches and reads, as other reviewers have pointed out, like a newspaper article knocked out under deadline and length pressure. For newspaper articles, such is no great handicap, but for a book is makes for tediousness. Next is a quibble, perhaps, but in the trade paperback edition I picked up the four photos on the cover are far better than the bubblegum snaps in the interior of the book. The book photos do nothing to enhance the content and waste paper. If you're looking for extremely light reading that will tax you none (as I was when I selected this book to read in a period of extreme exhaustion), "A good walk spoiled" will suffice. If you're looking for a good book, look elsewhere+books
The book shows a cult celebrity who is indeed overly full of himself+N+The way Idle in his book badly treats anyone who saw his performance but didn't care for it shows how truly stuck up he is. Everyone over 10 who watches his performances has to believe he's every bit as great as he thinks he is or he gets negative about it. The drawing of Idle as a lady is thankfully missing from the new paperback version.   To the most recent reviewer here before me I say this. George Harrison was part of the arguably biggest bunch of musicians in history (The Beatles). There was a moment in the 1960's when almost every youngster in the US, England and Australia between 13 and 18 years of age was into the Beatles. There was never a moment when the Pythons had such a fan following. Comparisons between Beatles and Pythons are ridiculous. When Idle's time comes the only people who'll blab about him in their own books would be the surviving Pythons (even Carol Cleveland)+books
This was my favorite story when...+P+This was my favorite story when I was a child. I love how it tells of a young girl who chooses to give up something she loves for her family and people... I read this book whenever I could in school. Now that I teach pre school I get to share the beauty of this story with my class and they love it too...In Texas you see them everywhere in late March to early May. I use to think it was funny but now I have to wonder why, when you see a bluebonnet an Indian paintbrush isn't that far away+books
He's been hiding in Houston too long+N+"The best way I know to resuscitate the theatre is to produce dangerous new works," says Stuart Ostrow in his very slim (154 pages, double spaced with wide margins) new memoir of his producing career.  However he does not define "dangerous new works."  From reading the book, it seems his definition of "dangerous new works" is whatever is being touted by the Village Voice.  (Richard Foreman, homosexuality, multiculturalism, Tom Eyen, etc.)  Stuart Ostrow has a story, but he is looking at it from the wrong point of view.  The way he sees it, he was producing quality innovative stuff that the world conspired to make fail.  Another way of looking at it would show a talented young producer who, after producing big hits with 1776 and PIPPIN, went pretentious and politically correct with his subsequent shows and understandably failed.  His damnation of Mel Brooks is unjustified since Ostrow himself says that he has not seen THE PRODUCERS.  Well, Stu, I have news for you.  THE PRODUCERS was a dangerous new work.  It was a slap in the face at political correctness and pretentiousness.  It single-handedly killed the bloated Euro Musical that had dominated Broadway for twenty years and paved the way for outrageous, unpretentious shows like HAIRSPRAY and THE WEDDING SINGER.  THE PRODUCERS resuscitated the American musical and Ostrow missed it.  Ostrow also badmouths WICKED claiming it was dependent upon special effects and spectacle.  If that were true, DANCE OF THE VAMPIRES would still be running.  The spectacle of WICKED enhances its compelling story, unlike the all the additional sets and extra players gratuitously inserted into the boring LA BETE.   Ostrow seems to think that problems can be solved by creating yet another bureaucracy to choose the artists who shall be anointed.  Evidence has show that the bureaucratic method produces pretentious work like that of Michael John LaChiusa and Jason Robert Brown, which the public doggedly refuses to embrace.  Ostrow tells some good anecdotes, but I wish there had been more of them.  There's the germ of a fascinating book in this volume and in Ostrow's previous memoir (also extremely brief and shares some material with this volume).  But at this point, there's still not a real book between the two of them+books

Leaning the language of drama...+P+Beginning with her personal experiences and attraction to the world of the theater, Swados bridges the gap of her own life with the common experiences of a group of youngsters as they create their own musical theater piece about the dangerous world they inhabit and the small redemptions of daily life as they accomplish their goals.  Specifically structured, the exercises begin with personal experiences and expand to include the group as a whole, each phase furthering the creative community: direction, voice, movement, characters, improvisation, discussion, time, space, music and choreography, the conclusion, their own show.  This very accessible handbook is directed toward a specific audience, young people from twelve to the early twenties, ages mixed for maximum benefit from the experience. From middle and high school, young people can perform these exercises before their peers at public and private schools and local community centers, all directed toward channeling creative energy in a positive manner, the resulting performance a theatrical experience for the students involved. All of the categories outlined lend to the expansion of students' awareness, but a teacher/reader can improvise as necessary to accommodate his group for a performance outside of school, inside school, as a training ground for young actors in a dramatic school or community environment, even as exercises for a limited class time.  In the context of the theater, mentoring focuses on the sense of family created by mutual experience, a spirit of togetherness that may yield lifelong friendships and artistic collaborations. This hands-on guide to theatrical performance is practical and effective; if followed, it will enrich the lives of students who participate in the process. Practical and specific, At Play is a valuable teaching tool; even more, it is the diagram for success in a field that enhances students' life experiences and collaborative endeavors with their peers, the result empowering.

The World is Full of Crashing Bores...+N+Although I agree with other reviewers who comment that the connection between this book and The Smiths' album is as thin as smoke, I was prepared to enjoy a well-written story just the same.  Unfortunately, I finished this wisp of a memoir wishing I had purchased the Thirty-Three and a Third title about Love's "Forever Changes" instead.  Although I appreciated Joe Pernice's occasionally clever metaphors, these were too few and far between, leaving us instead with the musings of the book's exasperated protagonist, a teenage male infatuated with girls, alcohol, and new wave music.  Of course, even as ordinary a topic as that can inspire brilliant and funny writing.  But it didn't here.  At least not for me, as I found Pernice's protagonist niether interesting nor sympathetic.  Worse, the book's exaggeration-as-a-primary-comedy-device (however accurate to the speech patterns of perhaps many, many average seventeen year-olds) is as unfunny as that Dave Barry essay.  (You know, the one he's recycled for the past decade and a half about how computers are complex and children are expensive and men like watching sports and drinking beer?)  The world is already full of crashing bores as it is.  So why not save your time and money and listen to The Smiths' "Meat Is Murder" while reading John Kennedy Toole's deliciously dark "A Confederacy of Dunces" instead+books

"Physician, Heal Thyself"  The Nazi Doctor and the Holocaust+P+In this detailed and well-researched account, psychologist Robert J. Lifton chronicles the Holocaust from a unique perspective:  the role played by Nazi medical doctors.  In doing so he explains the Nazi philosophy that formed the basis for mass murder:  the necessity to heal the ills of German society by eliminating all its corrupting influences.  Healing was and is the raison d'etre for the medical profession.  Doctors were thus compelled to become killers in the application of this all encompassing "cure."  Lifton traces the evolution of the Holocaust beginning with the "euthanasia" projects of the 30's.  Anyone incapable of being a productive member of society was consided, "life unworthy of life" and euthanized.   Initially this was confined to the mentally challenged and the old/infirmed.  Later even severely wounded German soldiers were not spared.  Execution technology perfected here formed the basis for the mass executions conducted later.  Lifton interviews many physicians in this work including some former Nazi's and many Jewish doctors forced to work at Auschwitz.  Here, the inner conflicts of persons trained to heal but actively involved in killing reached its apex.  Reactions varied from the cold, view of inmates as "laboratory rats" and nothing more by Josef Mengele, to the tortured acceptance of the necessity of doing his duty of Eduard Wirths.  Coping mechanisms included sending others to do the "dirty work" when possible, excessive use of alcohol, and in some cases, suicide.  Still, the work went on, despite any internal contradictions.  This is the first work I have seen that explained the Nazi philosophy and its impact on the Holocaust.  Because it was the stated goal of National Socialism to cleanse German society of all its ills, the participation of healers was essential.  The Nazi's never wavered in this twisted belief.  Would the Holocaust have occurred without the doctor's participation?  Undoubtedly, yes!  However doe's this excuse their participation?  You the reader must decide.  A great read.  Five stars!!  Harold Y. Grooms+books
More Jerry Fallwell ****+N+Unfortunately for the morons who continue to churn out these silly little tracts (I won't insult "books" by calling this that) the only one of our "Founding Fathers" who ever wanted anything even resembling a Christian nation (the phrase he used was "Christian Sparta") was Patrick Henry, and he didn't even sign the Constitution!  The other Founders from Jefferson to Franklin were deists, freebelievers, agnostics, atheists, or at the very least non-comformists like George Washington.  Who, despite "belonging" to a church requiring it (Martha's), never took commmunion in his entire life.  Jefferson who rewrote the Bible, editing out any of the magical "donkey's can talk, people can fly, and a man named Jesus lives up in the sky" nonsense so dear to Christians, certainly wasn't a xtian.  Adams said that the only thing that came out of religion and the state interacting was tyranny.  Geez kids I hate to burst you "Holier than thou" bubble but America isn't a christian nation, has never been a christian nation, and as long as truely freedom-loving people have breath in their body will NEVER be a christian nation+books
Compromising God to Promote Warren's Ego+N+Here it is, Rick Warren's latest Purpose-Drivel ® Corporation's latest marketing ploy. The insistent promotion of the Purpose-Drivel ® Life is nothing but an affront to Christian decency and blasphemous attack on Jesus. So far, the Purpose-Drivel ® Corporation's resin cross, also created to pad Warren's Disney-esque Church hasn't shown up on Amazon but it IS available for viewing on his publisher's site. This latest book makes a mockery of Christianity and should not be considered by anyone who is truly intent on seeking God's grace. Remember, Rick, "the meek shall inherit the Earth!+books

When is a circle not a circle?+N+John Calvin blazed the trail for most reformed reviewers: if you disagree with what is said, kill the 'sayer'.  Ad hominem critique, attempting to discredit an idea by crushing its advocate, is particularly odious in theological discussion but many of the chapters is this book raise it to an art form.  The argument of this book:  the classical description of God = the Biblical description of God: take our word for it, we are the experts, no discussion needed.  anyone who disagrees with us is obviously inspired by satan to destroy Christianity.  God loves only people who think like us - to hell (literally) with the others.  Classical theology presents a picture of God as a disconnected (in His ultimate nature), unfeeling, micro manager who chooses to allow evil when He could stop it.  As a recovering Calvinist who finally read the Scriptures and took them seriously (how's that for a back door ad hominem? I've still got it) it appears God has revealed himself in the Bible as something diferent: a loving, involved creator/father who is working with His children to restore a fallen world.  If you are looking for argument by stipulation, Beyond the Bounds is for you.  If you want careful analysis of germane scripture passages, look elsewhere+books
Are you my favorite book?+P+Our Grand daughter acts out this entire book with dramatic embellishments and subtle interpretation.  It is the most interactive book a youngster from 6 months on can love and enjoy forever+books
Obviously Yancey is a Pop Psychologist who has No Respect for the Bible+N+Mr. Yancey has no respect for the teaching of the Bible.  God is always there when it hurts.  In fact, God allows hurt.  Look at Book of Job.  God allowed Satan to kill Job's children (!!!) and tempt his wife away from Job and give Job a horrible disease.  God was always there.  In fact, God was a part of the plan to CAUSE Job to suffer.  Why?  On a whim.  Satan said that Job would lose faith if disaster struck him, so God said, "Okay, give it your best shot!"  Sometimes, God sends disasters into your home for a whim, for a wager with Satan.  This is the lesson from the Book of Job.  Sometimes, God Himself brings pain and death because Christians refuse to uphold the interests of the Kingdom of Christ.  Look at the book of Jeremiah.  It was God who chose to kill Israelites, destroy the Jerusalem Temple.  In fact, Jeremiah specifically states that King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, who was not a believer, was anointed by God to bring destruction.  It's like God anointing Bin Laden to destroy America.  That would be the similar analogy in terms of anointing a hostile unbeliever to destroy a believing nation.  The Bible is clear that God chose King Nebuchadnezzar to destroy the Jerusalem Temple and kill Israelites.  And anyone who opposed King Nebuchadnezzar opposed God Himself.  How does this apply to Bin Laden.  This is how seriously God takes desecration of His House, the Christian Church.  God will raise up an unbelieving enemey to destroy America if America desecrates God's houses.  And opposing this anointed enemy would be opposing God Himself.  Mr. Yancey should think seriously about what God teaches about suffering.  God gives suffering when believers desecrate His house.  God sends death and destruction when Christians refuse to uphold the interst of Christ.  This is an important lesson for America to learn+books
An exciting, fascinating and fun book about Wisconsin+P+Newly revised and updated by Diana Cook, Kristin Visser's Wisconsin Trivia is an exciting, fascinating and fun book about Wisconsin which is written entirely in question-and-answer format. Each question and answer is separated by a small icon of Wisconsin cheese! Divided into sections on Geography, Entertainment, History, Arts &amp; Literature, Sports &amp; Leisure, and Science &amp; Nature, Wisconsin Trivia is excellent not only as amusing and informative leisure reading, but also as a source of questions for a rousing game of Wisconsin-themed Trivial Pursuit. Highly entertaining and filled with questions sure to challenge even the most settled of Wisconsin residents, Wisconsin Trivia makes for an especially timely gift with the coming of Wisconsin's sesquicentennial - the 150th anniversary of Wisconsin's admission to the Union. Wisconsin Trivia is highly recommended for personal browsing or as an authoritative source for party time trivia contests+books
Delightful Sophistication+P+This textbook could be used by college creative writing students just beginning the study of writing poetry as well as advanced students, honing voice, craft, and expressive forms of poetry.  Wendy Bishop writes a friendly, well-organized textbook that makes learning sophisticated poetic techniques enjoyable.  This trade paperback is a fairly big book 9.09 x 6.28 x 0.83, with 437 pages, presenting a wealth of material in an interesting and accessible manner.  Chapters are organized by "forms," broadly conceived as patterns of sound, rhythm, and meaning.  Such forms include free verse, metered lines, rhymed and unrhymed couplets, elegies and aubades, ghazals and pantoums, haiku and haiku-like sequences, listing and repetitions, odes and praise songs, prose poems, quatrains, sestinas, sonnets, tercets, terza rima, triplets, and villanelles.  Each chapter begins with a clear discussion of professional examples of the form.  Next model poems are considered to move from "Reading into Writing." Then an extensive and expansive series of "Invention Exercises" appear, containing drafts of poems by students based on the exercises with additional professional examples.  I give my highest recommendation to this text for students of poetry+books
A masterful exercise in balance.+P+As Peale was a wonderfully typical yet extraordinary Enlightenment man, so David C. Ward reflects these sometimes complex combinations in his multi-layered style.  Written with elegant poeticism yet laiden with fact and academic detail, this book is a joy to read. A wonderful balance between autobiographical insight into Peale's character and a scholarly take on 'enlightened' American society, Ward triumphally balances both the subject and the reader's attention. By applying, for example, philosophical insight to his subject, to art and to historical events with seamless ease, Ward makes a great contribution to the study of an age and a man. +books
WOW!+N+I consider myself a fairly well-read individual and as a 1st generation Mexican American, I thought this would be an interesting book to read read.  Early on, it became abundantly clear what this book was about.    It was garbage.  The moral of the story is that if you want a better life, your S- outta luck.  Settle for what you have and don't ask for more!    "Materialism is bad".  Isn't materialism and the right to complain what this country was built on? +books
Loved the First, Loved the Second+P+What a writer!  The development of the Thomas Covenant character into a legitimate hero, and redemption of Linden Avery was quite a story to experience!  Absolutely unforgettable!  Well Done+books
Tarot Workbook+P+You can find an excercise with almost every type of approach to Tarot here. If you want fun excercises and Tarot information from someone who really knows the art-then I would definitely suggest this book+books
Saving Your Way to Prosperity.+P+Although they are billed as America's Cheapest Family, I don't think that this is entirely true. I think I was some years ago when the small business I was running failed during a recession. I remember being asked one time what I would do if I had $100,000, my answer was 'pay bills as far as it would go.' I implemented a lot of the tips given in the book and if I had had the book then would have implemented a lot more. The tips on saving money are great.   But, I'd throw in a couple of other points. If this tip saves you $10 but takes an hour of your time, you may be better off ignoring the tip if by working another hour at your job you could make more than the ten bucks.   Another point. I've found that there are people who just love cars. They eat, drink and sleep thinking about cars. You can find them at work, school, or in the neighborhood. They are always finding some super deal on cars. When I need one, I go ask several and invariably one of them knows of some super deal for $500 or a $1000.  This is different than what they recommend, but it's worked for me.   Anyway, now you can understand what the book's all about. They have found a lot of ways to save money. Just remember the other half is on making more+books
Heaven Eyes+P+The book that I am reading is called Heaven Eyes. In this book it talks about a young girl named Erin Law and her two friends that live in a orphanage because their parents did not care for them. Their orphanage owner's name is Marlene. When they run away they meet another child named Heaven Eyes that can see everything. Heaven Eyes is what started it all+books
Please See My Review [Mistakenly] Posted to Volume One+P+I accidentally posted my review of Vol. 2 on the Vol. 1 site.  &quot;Reader from DC&quot; seems to have deliberately done the same even tho' he's attacking something from the Intro to Vol. 2, hence my confusion.   Will post an actual review for vol. 1 once I've read it..+books
The Journey That Saved Curious George+P+I enjoyed reading it and was surprised at all they went through+books
Inadequate and Biased+N+Despite attempts to keep an open mind, I grew increasingly annoyed at the omissions, exaggerations and half-truths passed off as researched facts in this book. The author calls Cuba - a country under a dictator which holds  no elections - a &quot;democracy&quot; and extols the virtues of the  revolution without ever presenting the views and the injustices perpetrated  against those who opposed the revolution.  It is a shame that a work which  could have been an objective scholarly book instead is little better than a  propaganda pamphlet+books
confusing and boring story+N+I had really high hopes for this book when I bought it.  Seemed like an interesting premise.  I've read other books by this author and they were interesting, at least.  This book was confusing and really quite boring.  The first half of the book (200 pages) basically has the very forgettable characters doing not much of anything.  When the "action" finally starts, the menacing artifact is about as scary as a ham sandwich.  I have to be honest, I didn't even finish the book.  I stopped about 50 pages from the ending because I just couldn't stand it anymore+books
You have got to be kidding!+N+My twins are 3 1/2 and have not wanted to start potty training. I thought I would buy this book and see if I could have success. The day after I ordered the book, I bought my daughter some princess underwear and she suddenly became very excited about the prospect of not wearing diapers. My son immediately followed suit. Unfortunately, the book had not arrived yet, so I just had to use some common sense and good instincts. Lucky for me, this worked and my twins were potty trained by the end of the week and ready for school after Easter Break. I offered no rewards other than praise. I did not use a doll. I did not do any of the ridiculous things suggested by this book which seems very outdated. At the end of the first week back at school, the book finally arrived. I decided to read it just to see what it said and was glad it arrived so late. If you have not bought a book yet, don't buy this one. Just use common sense, don't try to train too early and let your child's success be its own reward+books
Book in need of an editor!+N+I ordered this book because I am extremely interested in the untold stories of the Partition of India even though the reviews told me not to.  I wished I had heeded the advice.  The book is incredibly repetitive--to the point of being unreadable. I learned very little.  Not worth the time to read or money to purchase. +books
Sadly Disappointed+N+Having followed the Mrs. Murphy mysteries over the years, I am sorry to say that this volume leaves me wanting... wanting a good mystery!  Ms Brown seems to have dipped into a formula method for compiling her books.  What started the series as bright, witty and compelling, now lacks style, substance and charm.  The animals have become more vocal and unbelievable with each new volume and the sidebars into instructional content and social commentary are too distracting.  Perhaps it's time to put Mrs. Murphy and friends away for a bit until a real plot surfaces+books
Cute twist on a classic+P+Gingerbread Baby is a twist on the traditional story of "The Gingerbread Boy."  Matti and his mother follow the recipe to bake a gingerbread boy, but when Matti opens the oven too early a gingerbread baby jumps out instead.  As the gingerbread boy does in the original story, the gingerbread baby runs away and is chased through the town by the townspeople and animals.  However, in this version, instead of the Gingerbread Baby being eaten by a fox, Matti stays home baking a gingerbread house for the Gingerbread Baby to run into.  Children will enjoy lifting the flap on the last page and seeing the Gingerbread Baby inside his house.  This book would be appropriate for children ages 5 through 8.  Children in this age group enjoy hearing make-believe stories involving talking animals or toys or, in this case, talking cookies!  I think young children especially will be happy that in this version the Gingerbread Baby does not get eaten by the fox in the end.  I recommend sharing this story with children for enjoyment at Christmastime.    Jan Brett's illustrations are beautiful and cover every inch of the page.  The authenticity of the drawings of the Swiss village and the townspeople is stunning.  Each image is drawn with exquisite detail.  The illustrated borders on each page, which give the appearance of being made out of cookie dough and icing, picture additional scenes related to the events unfolding in the story inside Gingerbread Baby shaped cutouts.  The eye-catching endpapers round out the beauty of the book as a whole. +books
5-stars+P+Letter to a Young Gymnast is a excellant book.  My coach recommended it to me, and after reading it, I gave it to my best friend to read.  I was barely able to put it down.  It is not so much a story of Nadia Comaneci's career as a gymnast as a story of what life in Romania was like.  You walk away from this book feeling like you actually were there and know Nadia Comaneci personally.  I rarely find biographies or autobiographies that are this good.  Defidently a 5-star book+books
A great book+P+I saw this book in a store for about $2.50 and thought to myself what could it hurt to purchase "You can make it happen". Well purchasing Mr. Graham's book turned me around to the point that I see my vision for the future and what it has to offer me.  I started by purchasing a day planner and already positive results have come into my life along with some positive thinking people.  There are still many areas in my life that need to grow and improve, but we have to start somewhere.  I would like to thank Mr. Graham for giving me the blueprint to success+books
Help for Gifted Parents+P+Kathy Matthews offers no-nonsense advice with a sense of humor. This how-to-parent-and-feel-good-about-yourself book is a must read. . .and, along with Jim Trelease's book on reading aloud to your children, will certainly become a standard baby shower gift from me in the coming years.  Matthews speaks with the authority of a mother comfortable in her own skin--and with her own children.  Brava, Ms. Matthews+books
Personal transformation+P+As an executive coach and facilitator of leadership transformation, I was inspired my the author's personal journey of growth and transformation. The feel was authentic, and reflected a deep committment to fulfilling a higher purpose. I personally found many answers to problems that perplexed me. It has also been a source of wisdom to support and empower those around me in both formal and informal settings. Looking for a purpose for being? You will find some answers here+books
Well written but tedious+N+This is my 3rd PD James book and I have to say I was quite disappointed.  (The other 2 were Murder Room and A Certain Justice.)  I found most of the characters to be not terribly believable and one dimensional.  Even Dalgliesh was not well drawn.  And to make it worse, the plot was not believable.  I agree with someone else who said borrow this from the library, don't buy it.+books
More is less+N+Too long-winded. Too many seldom-encountered words employed. Too much evasiveness by the author, in withholding clear meaning from what he was saying rather than transmitting that meaning to the reader readily, willingly, succinctly and immediately.   A painful reading experience, not an enjoyable one, unfortunately. The author seemed to be trying to prove his cleverness, superiority and literary prowess (all of which he clearly possesses) rather than simply telling a story. It was a relief to get this book over with. The story was good, but the author took too long to tell it, with too many asides and meanderings.  This book is maybe a good lesson in why authors ought to try to be brief, clear, succinct. Authors will be taking up the reader's time without paying the reader for that time, and also are locking diligent readers into having to finish a story once they start reading it, and the author doesn't have an automatic right to more time than the story deserves. Did this story really need 470 pages of tight-set text? +books
Would have made a better blog than book...+N+The premise here is so engaging that I'm not surprised the author got it published, but basically, it's such a self-indulgent ramble that it's not worth the time of people other than the author.  How can a person make the topic of James Bond and his 'disturbing world' feel so draggy that it takes real commitment to keep reading through the first 100 pages?  If you'd like to know, read the first hundred pages of this book.  Like many, I came to this book expecting very little except that it be consistently interesting and fun to read.  We're talking about James Bond here after all.  The author repeatedly reminds us not to take his pontifications overly seriously, and that's fine, but in that case, we shouldn't have to be bored.  I would strongly recommend not reading this book.  It could have been covered in a long magazine article or, as I said, as the occasional comment on a blog about James Bond+books
the very best+P+Carol Berg, in my humble opinion, is the very best living writer of "dependable" fantasy...i.e. nothing that offends my sensibilities, but transports me to a place I'd like to be, filled with people I'd like to know. While I consider each of her books I've had the privilege to read as safe territory, her characters are anything but safe, each generally beat to a pulp one or more times in each story line.  Some would consider this violence excessive, but it always moves the story forward and promotes the philosophy of pain and hardship's place in selflessness.  A lost concept in the cocoon of ease and comfort in which most of us dwell.    Daughter of Ancients delivers all the promise of the preceding Bridge of D'Arnath books.  It is satisfying, suspenseful, rich and so very human...with the delightful tendency of Carol Berg to often surprise us thoroughly and tie her plot lines together without the too-tidy endings that so many authors fall into.  Thank you, Carol, for the gift of your imagination and the concise nature of your beautiful writing+books
Hopeful for those who seek harmony in the world+P+I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who thinks that religious wars, repression of individual spirits or rape of the earth are good things. Those who seek peace, harmony, celebration of each of us and respect for  our earth will find this hopeful+books
Delightful!+P+This book captures you quickly and holds you the length of the story.  I  found the story enlightening as it explained one of the Jewish holidays  with reverence and warmth.  A wonderful book for younger children of any  religion+books
A Solid Read+P+If you have any weakness in remembering the acccomplishments of the golfers from the twenty's, thirty's, forty's and fifty's, this book will be invaluable. It is also a fun read and has an interesting twist at the end. The book cover suggests it is a combination of Grisham and Finestein. That is a bit of hyperbole, but it is a well done piece of writing and one which golfers and non-golfers can relate to. Worth picking up+books
Very Helpful!+P+This book has really helped me in class.  It ties into all of the other books we use and all of the discussion in class.  The book is actually interesting and easy to read unlike other textbooks+books
Planning, not just plans+P+Unlike most business plan guides that focus on producing an impressive document, this book actually helped me plan to run a company. It anticipates and explains virtually every potential pitfall for a company-builder. The book transforms the business planning process into something that you can and should use every day. It touches all aspects of analyzing your business and deciding where to go next. I highly recommend it+books
Holy Roman Empire, not explained+N+I recently read The Thirty Years' War 1618-1648, hoping to gain some insight into the Holy Roman Empire by reading about one of its turning points. Well, I was left rather disappointed. A short book, it does little to set the scene--clearer explanations of the structure of the empire would have been good, as I was left very much in the dark as to who Electors were, and what the political structure of the Empire was, and what the rules of succession were, for instance. Maps were the most part absent as well, and they would have been very helpful to trace the course of the war, the movement of troops, etc. The Thirty Years' War is a civil war in the Empire, in which foreign powers intervened, and warred with each other as well...yet the explanations of what these foreign powers did against each other outside of the Empire is somewhat lacking.  So, I'm still left scratching my head as to the structure of the Holy Roman Empire, to some extent. The book did not fulfill the role I had hoped it to play. It certainly did explain to some extent the consequences of the war to the Empire, so I did learn something, but not as much as I'd hoped. I would advise caution before picking this book up+books
A much needed book+P+Well-written, though-provoking survey of the social, legal and political terrain of "family" policy, and the competing theories and practices thereto. Hopefully this will lead to a more intellectually honest discussion of "the place of families" in American law.+books
Not for &quot;nonspecialists&quot;+N+The cover states the book is for &quot;students and nonspecialist&quot;, which I found to be not true.   The best example was in the chapter Metaphysics, if you do not already understand the concepts and especially  Aquinas` arguements before reading the book you will definitly not  understand them after reading the book.  I felt the book confuses much more  than enlightens+books
Pretty but Limited+N+Although the book is filled with very nice and informative pictures, it is nevertheless quite limited. I needed to relocate a toilet in a renovation project. Advanced enough, right? Well this book was useless.  There was no  information on venting requirments. If you like learning-by-example, this  book may be for you, but only if the examples match what you need to do+books
this is a long winded book that could be 200 pages shorter.+N+This book is required by several Women's Studies classes around the country.  I feel it is too wordy and hard for many students in undergraduate programs to understand. The main issues in the book are  hidden behind a large academic language that not all students understand.  The points made in the book though, are valid ones+books
Pretty Weak Effort+N+I'm a conservative blogger who LOVES to laugh at liberal celebrities, but there's not much meat here.  Hirsen's book feels pretty slapdash and disjointed; the writing is nothing special, and the stories have been told with more flair elsewhere.  I wanted to like it...it's just not very good+books
This is not the Canterbury Tales!+N+This is a retelling of the Canterbury Tales, very simplified...in some cases leaving out the best parts!  I believe it may have been originally intended safe for children.    If you're looking for a translation into modern English, keep looking.  I am+books
Incomplete Book Omits Key Topic+N+Any book that claims to fit real people has to address the issue of fitting pants, particularly for women since we are still stuck with designs based on men's pants.  While these authors have written a separate book in this series specifically for fitting pants, &quot;Pants for Real People&quot;, this current book is sadly mis-titled and needs to clearly state that it does NOT address pants.  As 5'10&quot; woman with a long lower torso and a sway back, fitting pants is difficult to say the least.  For an all-encompassing book that addresses fitting issue, see Singer Sewing's &quot;Perfect Fit&quot;, which has lots of pictures, clear directions for both major and minor alterations, before and after shots, and deals with all subjects.  For a book specifically for fitting pants, I recommend Singers &quot;Pants that Fit&quot;.  I own both and use both regularly+books
Not so good+N+First off, I'll admit that I didn't read the whole book.  Now I'll say my peace on it.  Hacker generalizes broadly about the behaviors and sentiments of both whites and blacks.  Though white himself, he seems to absolutely  despise whites across the board as either racist scum or well-meaning but  idiotic.  Then he says that Martin Luther King Jr. only came to prominence  as a leader of the civil rights movement because the whites in power chose  him.  It sounds to me as if Hacker thinks that the black population were  too ignorant to choose there own leader and allowed the whites to give them  their hand-picked MLK Jr.  The thought of that makes me ill.  Apparently,  in Hacker's world view, everyone except himself is either evil or stupid.   But it was very entertaining+books
The Crowning Achievement Of (Post)Modern French Philosophy+N+That this book is receiving one star, given the title of my review, should surprise no one.  Look, say what you will; I am a classically trained, analytic, Anglophone philosopher with a penchant for clarity and rigor.  That is where I stand.  If you are looking for a text which purports to be theoretical, and yet is obviously densely literary and aphoristic, perhaps I don't understand what you're on about, and perhaps you don't either.  This book is neither clear nor rigorous.  Where it doesn't mutate truly elementary understandings of science (not to say that either Deleuze understands what the difference between science and pseudoscience is), psychology, and economics to suit its incoherent purposes, it avoids any understanding whatsoever.  The philosophical work contained herein is non-starting.  That is, it is not philosophy, as it is neither argumentative, interpretive, nor logical.  There are no discernible conclusions (which is not to say that there are none in this pig latin dog's dinner, but they probably aren't deduced from premisses ) where there is anything like 'argument' at all.  To say that I'm missing the point, you'd first have to show that such work can have a point.  That it violates hard-won conventions of philosophical discourse, which are taken as primitive (I can't tell you how many times the Law of Excluded Middle was violated), is not a victory for this work.  It is a setback.  That it has not been translated into English, but rather some retarded cousin of English, is perhaps partly to blame for my lack of understanding.  I tend only to be able to read natural languages.  But then, again, perhaps my rhizomatic foreshortening (to wit: to SHORTEN is also to LENGTHEN) is in part quasiculpable (that is, retrodogmatically) as a blamematic(viz. contraposto) which tends inter alia to produce (and re-produce, as Malreaux reads Sartre in referential milieus of Darwinian technologies of traffic control) my congnitive disfunctionabilities.  I recommend the work of W.V.O. Quine if you're looking for a 'philosophy of our time,' as one reviewer suggested we must+books

Lucid and Probing+P+In these essays, Solomon explores in more detail certain topics that he had only been able to touch on more generally in the earlier, full-fledged biography he had written of Beethoven. (He has since followed up more essays strictly on "late Beethoven.")  I find these essays thoughtful, probing, and lucid--not least the fine essay on Beethoven's genuine but ambivalent quest for faith. --Frank Burch Brow+books
Excellent+P+The best work by Twain I've read to date. This combination history, memoir, travelogue, and collection of sketches is both humorous and entertaining. I have also learned a great deal about Twain, his time, and the history of steamboating and the Mississippi. Written later in his life, this work is mature in style as well as content in spite of its loose organization and focus. Highly recommended+books
Thoroughly Disappointing+N+I have to say I am a huge PKD fan, and have read just about all of his books.  And before you dismiss this review, know that I read and enjoyed Valis and The Divine Invasion, precursors to this book, the third in the series.  But, sadly, this book just was not the vintage Dick classic that Ubik, or A Scanner Darkly was.  In fact, I was disgusted with this book, and to date, I have loved every one of Dick's books, even the more obscure ones (Galactic Pot Healer).  Though Ubik and my personal favorite Now Wait For Last Year had a strong, cohesive plot littered with welcome digressions and departures, I can't help thinking that Transmigration was just one long digression lacking any sort of structure, and without the strong and interesting characters in Dick's other books.  With a slew of obscure references to various operas, epic poems, and other pieces of the impotent intellectual vangaurd, it seemed Dick was trying to prove to us his cultural superiority and sophistication.  And that is not the Philip K. Dick I know and admire.  I suppose if you feel compelled to read everything that Dick has written, then read this, but do yourself a favor and borrow it because it is not a book that you will want to re-read+books
Disappointing Sequel+N+I've loved Jeanne Ray's other books (Julie & Romeo, Step Ball Change, and Eat Cake). I found them all to be well written, funny and entertaining reads, with varied and likeable characters. This book doesn't come close to meeting the standard set by the others. It isn't funny at all. All of the characters act horribly, including the martyred Julie who lets everyone in her family walk all over her. I haven't read a book in a long time where I didn't like a single character. (And I liked these people in the first book - Julie and Romeo). I highly recommend her other books, but I'd stay away from this one+books
The Insentive Eye+N+A stunningly mediocre book. Unorthodox,  revisionist stances, can often be bracing. Johnson's are merely inane. He seem incapable of seeing with a sympathetic eye. His biases are pervasive and uninteresting. So one can "learn" from Johnson that Giotto is "wooden"; that Artemisia Gentlischi  "weakness was that she was overweight"; that Cezanne is a  "would be realist" producing "crude" pieces which are "stiff and awkward and anatomically incorrect....clumsily painted ( Johnson reaches this conclusion by comparing him to Chardin!) and  that Cezanne's reputation is really only a result of "commerce.  Johnson  eye is so dead and his theories so skewed that he is obliged to excoriate virtually all art from the twentieth century onward as mere "fashion art" and "higher frivolity". Wretched history to be sure--but hardly "new+books
It is outdated.+N+This was the bible I used for a project, I loved the ideas and I named the classes after the names in this book.  However, 3 years later, after reviewing this book, I would say, many ideas in the book are already outdated and over emphasized in the past. Just remember the good old days when EJB was glorious and almost every company went for it.  After the EJB rush, now when we are back to basic, we realized that many Plain Old Design Patterns are real gold. I would suggest you don't rely heavily on J2EE, focus on domain design instead.  Many books provide this advice on domain driven development, such as Design Patterns, Refactoring, Domain Driven Design.   After you read those books, then read this book again. You will agree with this review.  http://www.amazon.com/Books-for-Professional-Java-Developers/lm/R34SZ976NXXD22/ref=cm_lm_byauthor_title_full/104-7074534-463355+books
Satisfaction+P+There is something for every woman is this book. rather you're lesbian, bisexual, or heterosexual. it is one of my all time favorites. I was really struggling with my sexuality when i came across this book. It helped me to understand that i wasn't alone out there, and that every women deserves satisfaction sexually just as men do in our society today.+books
Don't bother+N+There have been a dozen or more &quot;boy's books&quot; lately, most notably the exceptional Raising Cain, by Kindlon and Thompson.  Most of them are not worth the bother, and this compendium is at the top of that list+books
great bogus!+N+Sallie Ann Glassman is not a Mambo! She does attempt to pimp Lwa for her performances and for her weekly "ceremonies". Any serious Mambo and Hougan (and even practitioner of Haitian Vodou) will laugh when they hear the following: Sallie Ann Glassman's "house" does not have grades! Traditional Haitian Vodou knows 3 grades of initiation! Sallie Ann Glassman does not perform the Priye Ginea because it was Catholic... she opted for an invocation to the four directions and four elements lifted from either the OTO or Wicca or Enochian tradition, but done in French, to sound like Creole - so the average tourist would not know that it was just some invocation from another tradition that had nothing to do with Vodou. When she takes people to Haiti for initiation (remember: no grades!) she gives them Pot Tets filled with a feather and 2 or 3 other items. She does not teach passwords or handshakes to her initiates - who, again, have not received any grade! To make a long story short, this book and the author are great bogus and have NOTHING to do with real Haitian Vodou+books
A must read+P+What an amazing account of a surgeon's life!  I loved this book.  Starkly honest, the writer does not spare herself.  Gripping, heartrending accounts of former patients and the training of a surgeon.  I couldn't put it down.  Why aren't all surgeons so caring?  Some of the reasons are explained in this book+books
One of the worst...+N+I was excited when I saw this book with such a title.  But it turned out to be one of the worst (popular math book) I have read in the last few years.  Then I read the review by sporkdude on November 7, 2004 (thanks sporkdude!).  He made some very good suggestions (that we should ignore all the odd chapters but a handful of pages, if not ignore the whole book at all).  I gave the book a  second chance, but it just once again confirmed that it's a really badly written book.  I can tell you why.  On page xiii of the book, the auther claims that "I don't believe the Riemann Hypothesis can be explained using math more elementary than I have used here, so if you don't understand the Hypothesis after finishing my book, you can be pretty sure you will never understand it."  Is it true?  What I am sure is that you will not understand what Riemann Hypothesis is after finishing this book.  The author never tried to get to the point, or I would say he was incapable in doing so.  Even worse, you wouldn't be able to grisp a big picture of what the hypothesis was all about, as the author jumped around too much, that you're not sure what it's all up for.  Together with his tedious writing style (e.g. he likes to throw you with some random decimal numbers upto a hundred digits), it won't take you too long to realize it's just a waste of time to keep on reading this book.  It is "amazing" that such a book would get an average of 4.5 stars by 62 reviewers.  If it was your very first popular math book and you found it delightful, I can assure you that there're some a lot better popular math books out there waiting for you to explore+books
do yourself a favor and read it!+P+This novel got great reviews and then got forgotten.  That is a shame.  Everything You Know is funny, sad, moving, and utterly convincing.  Ms. Heller did a superb job of getting inside the mind, body and soul of man  just past his middle age.  It's quite a feat and quite a book+books
A worthwhile addition to your Beatles library+P+As a fan of nearly 30 years, this was one of the first Beatles books I ever bought, and it remains a worthwhile buy for today's new fans. It may not be as detailed or as enlightening as the Mark Lewishon-type of books, but it benefits greatly from being written in the sixties - and having a firsthand access to the band. Hunter Davies includes many stories and insights that would simply not be available to today's writers - because they weren't there. The chapter that describes them writing 'With A Little Help From My Friends', for example, is as amusing as it is amazing. And I very much enjoyed the prologue, where Davies explains the difficulties he had with Queenie Epstein and Aunt Mimi. And his meeting with Pete Best in the mid-sixties is as poignant a scene as you will ever get in a Beatles book. It is stories like those that make the book worth buying+books
For another time+N+This book has not been helpful to me in this first few months of loss.  Although it does show similarities people have in their experience of deep grief, it does not offer solutions.  Shakesphere and Poe may have had similar experiences, and may have written about them elloquently, but that doesn't help me today.  I think this book needs to be targeted to a diferent population than those of us who are looking for answers+books
More about his personal life...+P+This is a good book if you haven't read any of the other books about Feynman.  A few of the chapters have been published elsewhere, such as in "The Pleasure of Finding Things Out" which in my opinion was a better (more science-centric) book.  This book was more about his personal life and included some interesting information about his experiences with women and his time spent travelling+books
Draming because this book is so bad+N+When you mix soft core porn and culturly confused Cubans, you get this PIECE OF CRAP LITERATURE. I think their must have been at least 30 different sex or sex related scenes and oh so many other odd things. One example is when one of the characters (a girl) masturbates to her  mother's old boyfriend's picture, imagining him going down on her...uck! The plot is so badly intwined and mixed together you want to question ever reading again! FOR THE SAKE OF LITERATURE DON'T READ THIS!+books
Ugh.+N+I think irridium said it most articulately, but I just wanted to add to the hate for this book.  I have never experienced such a strong visceral negative reaction to any work of literature.  Save yourself some time and read Nabokov's Ada instead+books
excellent, level-headed, and thought-provoking+P+a very well-considered look at the realtionship between digital  communications technology and local communities, with particularly good  treatment of public access, education, and attempts to use computers to  enhance, rather than undermine, neighborhood and community relations.   Highly recommended+books
Not user friendly+N+I wish I had not purchased this item. Not user friendly--confusing to use for a novice.+books
Khruschev - A most Amazing Mixture of Mercuriality and Idiosyncrasy Brought Vividly to Life+P+If - and that is a big if (the book is fully 600 pages long - it helps to fall ill when you read it - I did!) - you have the time and want to invest it for obtaining a first class overview over the great power play during the decade between 1955 and 1965 - the Khruschev era - this definitely is the book to read! Its authors not only provide a refreshingly new perspective to the (more or less well-) known events of, i.a., the first Israeli-Egyptian war, the (Soviet) occupation of Hungary and the Cuban missile crisis, they fully succeed in transforming this period of history into a most plausible and very exciting "story", in fact, into something of a "thriller" (in the best sense of the word). It is the story of a great power desperate to come up to its claim to possess or at least to be accorded equal status with the other - even greater - super-power, the United States or, more generally, the "West". In order to achieve that one goal, almost anything would do, even extreme brinkmanship that several times brought the world close to thermonuclear war. Khrushev is shown as a man to have carried within himself the dominating characteristics of the Soviet Union itself, viz., an enormous inferiority complex, trying to combine it with catching any opportunity that would present itself to bring pressure to bear on the other side, even using or better: threatening the use of force, wherever it seemed this might bring political advantage. Fortunately for the world, this mercurial leader who disposed of the means to blow up the world (or at least: great parts of it) was restrained enough (be it on his own reason, be it by his more risk-averse colleagues within the Presidium) not to actually let the world go "over the brink" but to withdraw each time at the last moment. It is the humiliation of these retreats as well as the sense of responsibility displayed by him in making them which, if anything, ultimately cost him his job and earns him the status of a statesman (rather than merely that of a cunning politician).  Against this background, only two - very minor - criticisms:  First, there is a really unwarranted "blank space" in the book as regards the European Economic Community (today`s "European Union") whose very creation was decisively triggered by some of the events described in it (Suez; Hungary), by making the European states mercilessly feel their own palsy vis-à-vis the super-powers. It is ironic - and should clearly have been mentioned in the book - to see how the very institution for whose creation Khruschev bore no minor responsibility - would become one of the cornerstones of the West's economic superiority and thus a decisive factor for the eventual downfall of the Soviet Empire.  Second, even though this would admittedly go slightly beyond the clear scope of the book (Khruschev's Cold War, restricting its topic to his role as politician), it might have been interesting for the reader to be permitted at least a brief peep behind the veil of this astounding politician's official role into his private life, if only to underpin/corroborate some of the conclusions regarding this most Mercurial character!  This leaves only one thing to be hoped for: at least I, for my part, am dying to read PART II: "The Breshnev Years", by the same authors, should it ever come out!  +books

Not too sexy here+N+Pat Califa wrote, "Our culture insists on sexual uniformity and does not acknowledge any neutral difference only crimes, sins, disease and mistakes."    Such we see represented in Dr. Amen's book.  Dr. Amen makes reference to what he considers normal sexually in his book.  Like so many clinicians and diastognicians his normality is of a vanilla world.  Anything outside of that is referred to as an imbalance in the brain or a disorder.  My own research has been focused on debunking the myths about sexuality that are perpetuated in this book.  The chapter on addictions and fetishes lacks any creative thinking whatsoever.  Unfortunately I returned the book to the bookstore due to the limited thinking represented here.    Sincerely, Ilona Paris, LMHC +books

Laffertarian Bedtime Reading+P+The best take I've read on Lafferty is from John Clute's Encyclopaedia of Fantasy. He echoes the view that R.A. Lafferty is his own man, and you've got to read all of him to even start to know what he's about. Someone new to Lafferty would be better off starting with Fourth Mansions or Past Master or Reefs of Earth or the many volumes of short stories. Those books make some concessions to the general reader, while this one decidedly does not.  Thanks to Wildside Press for making this novel available. I had looked for a long time for a "new" Lafferty novel and could only find more short stories. Nothing against those; I read his stories avidly before ever cracking the cover of a novel, but I enjoy it when Lafferty stretches out in a full-length work and invites us into his universe.  Serpent's Egg takes place in the indeterminate future of 2035 when all sorts of experiments are taking place between animals, humans and humanoid computers, resulting in various hybrid offspring. These mega-persons all reach maturity at ten years old, but should they prove to be a serpent's egg, a threat to the "floating world", assassins are sent after them by the Kangaroo Court, seen as a portent in the sky of a kangaroo. The offspring of four experiments join up to form a magic twelve, including in their number a psychic python, an unborn elephant, a wolverine, a bear, a computer, and a few humans. It's all very Laffertarian and it probably doesn't give anything away to say that the epilog (written by a whale) claims that half the book is lies.  I had a copy of Wildside Press' collection of Lafferty stories, Iron Tears, which had a lot of typos in it. It may have since been edited, however, since my edition doesn't have the introduction by Michael Swanwick included in the newer edition. Regardless, this book has few typos and is well-produced. It's also as much reading as a whole book of short stories, just right for Laffertarian bedtime reading.+books
The Self Indulgent Virus, A Hindrance to the Debate+N+Since the end of the Cold War and the virtual eradication of the two other great political ideologies of the twentieth century, namely Communism and Fascism, the victory of Capitalism has earned it the right to proceed unmolested and, to a very great degree, unquestioned in its dissemination to every point on the globe.  This, as Samir Amin author of The Liberal Virus aptly points out, could be dangerous.  Capitalism is a system that has always been based on the Darwinian principal of survival of the fittest and as such "can produce nothing other than an intensification of the inequalities between people."  True.  So true.  And anybody who takes the time to actually study Adam Smith's, The Wealth of Nations, will see that the twin engines supposed to drive a Capitalist economy are greed and competition, with very little regard for the actual well being of humans.  This should come as no surprise, as a quick look around at the current champions of Capitalist enterprise in America like insurance, energy and telecommunications will readily reveal.    Any thinking person must agree that it is at least worthwhile to keep a cautious eye on the current trajectory of unfettered Capitalism, and inquiring into its possible dangers is undoubtedly healthy.  In fact, what's needed is a measured evaluation of Capitalism as it exists today, both good and bad, with the kind of unflinching exploration into its darker implications provided by Samir Amin here.      But in the current American political climate where knee-jerk Conservatism hold sways and the petty ranting of narrow-minded demagogues is counted as reasoned political discourse, this is no time to inject an analysis of Capitalism with anti-Americanism and hand-wringing over the demise of Socialism.  A book like this advances the issue with only the most restrained and open-minded readers and, for the rest, drags the debate back into the muck of Cold War hysterics.    Not only does Amin reveal himself as a whiney, vindictive Socialist who would love nothing more than to see America brought to its knees, but he is an obtuse and turgid writer of the kind only academia can produce.  There were sentences in this book I had to read three times before I could figure out what he was saying, and his annoying habit of loading his sentences with digressive clauses, parenthetical clarifications and coined words, had me grateful that this book was only 112 pages long - I have read 300 page books that took me less time to get a handle on.  All in all, The Liberal Virus explores some issues much in need of inquiry but does so in a way that is so off-putting that it cannot gain much traction among American readers, no matter what their stripe, and can only serve to hinder the debate.  What we need is a book about Capitalism that can open minds, not scare them closed or befuddle them with the liberal self-indulgence of its author.      +books
extra reference.+N+over half of this book consists of material already available in the "man" pages on a linux system.   the book boasts how it includes many many examples on how to use each command, this is utterly false. there are infact too few examples included.   100% of the material in this book can be found on the internet, on the linux system's info and man pages.   this book will not be friendly for the linux newbie. the title is misleading, "in a nutshell" usually means "the basics of a working system". this book is merely acts as reference for the abundance of reference freely available+books
Where are the first 8 stories?+N+I bought a dog-eared copy of this collection (&quot;Trouble is My Business&quot;) at a book sale for $1.50 a year ago.  The copy I have is thick with 12 stories.  I bought this copy of &quot;Trouble is my Business&quot; to have a better copy, but was disappointed to discover that it had been whittled down to only the final four Marlowe stories.  My question is, what the hell happened to the first 8 and why is Amazon.com still describing this as a collection of 12 when there are merely four?  That's not jake, fellas+books
Read reviews carefully+P+Amazon has not done a good job sorting out the various editions and translations of Marcus Aurelius' Meditations.  As a result, comments with many stars actually may be referring to an entirely different translation.  Likewise, hardbound references don't match up with the paperback versions.  I'd recommend that you find a copy somewhere and look at the text yourself before you order.   +books
The First and the Best Biography+P+I was quite surprised to see a biography of James Tiptree, Jr. at all, let alone such a magnificent one.  Ms. Phillips has done an amazing job at bringing both the woman and the writer into clear focus. I can't imagine that any details of Tiptree/Sheldon's life are not captured here.  Certainly a must read for true sci-fi fans and well as those curious about the history of women's role in our society.  This bio will win several awards, no doubt about it.  Quite simply all you could ask for in one volume+books
A Big Disapointment+N+This book is a big disapointment. The begining chapters have some useful information, but much of it can easily be found on the web.

A Nice, Brief Look at the 265th Pontiff+P+Having studied the work of Joseph Ratzinger (Benedict XVI) and read more than half-a-dozen works on him, I came to "God's Choice" with a significant cache of knowledge on the subject.  While Weigel's work and social commentary (perhaps best known through his syndicated column) remains a source of contention and, at times, controversy, I was rather pleased with this book.  I believe that the major fault of the work rests in the initial focus on John Paul II (which occupies more than 100 pages of the 268-page book).  Like David Gibson in his "The Rule of Benedict," Weigel apparently felt it necessary to remind the reader of all the great details of Benedict's predecessor - a task I find to be superfluous.  That said, it is a good book.  I was delightfully surprised at times while reading this book to find that Weigel had occasionally rendered his advisories an appropriate level of respect.  Citing John Allen, Jr., (chief Vatican correspondent for National Catholic Reporter, often noted by being at ends ideologically with the views of Weigel) and others, Weigel significantly avoids polemical spin in a way that has garnered new respect from this reader.  However, it should also be noted that there remains a peppering of Weigel's clear and present agenda throughout the book.  While at times is appears fleeting or subtle, reader beware that his ecclesial and cultural politics surface here and there.  Perhaps one example would suffice.    While addressing his opinion of a "progressive Catholic movement" and its possible Cardinal-elector representatives, he makes the unfounded and impertinent remark:  "That, in turn, may explain why the progressive project is infertile - increasingly unable to attract the brightest students in graduate schools of theology in the United States." (Weigel 136-137)  Without any substance, using vague terms, Weigel makes a sweeping statement regarding the state of graduate theological students - as it pleases him.    All in all, this is a wonderfully written work.  Weigel is clearly intelligent, while politically transparent, and his writing style engages the reader.  I would recommend this book as a companion volume to the many other works dedicated to elucidating the life and work of Benedict XVI (see John Allen, Jr.'s "Pope Benedict XVI," H. J. Fischer's "Pope Benedict XVI: A Personal Portrait," and Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger's "Milestones.")+books
me, myself and I+P+a certain Rick Stanton previously left a nice review saying that unless you were raised by dogs, this book will teach you nothing.  in todays' America, there is no time or room for compassion. it's all about me, myself and I. This book, (even if you were raised by educated, compassionate people who took the time to really educate you) will at least refresh the basics in your mind. Basics that are probably faded in your mind by the everyday crazy rat race. For those who like most were not raised with compassion and intelligence of the heart, it will open up some unused parts of your being+books
Mind-bending+P+Fred Alan Wolf does a good job of explaining the latest thinking in quantum physics, which he himself concedes to be impossible for us to visualize in many respects, for readers without scientific training.  He does this by adopting a historical approach, following the evolution of man's understanding of the nature of motion from the speculations of early Greek philosophers such as Zeno and Aristotle through the work of ground-breaking physicists such as Einstein and Bohr up to the most current knowledge about the crucial importance of the observer in determining reality.  Wolf includes some mind-blowing speculations about the nature of human consciousness in the quantum universe which should fascinate you even if you find them difficult to accept+books

Deconstructing America's False Reality+P+This is a book that will change your outlook on life in America. It is the plea of one man, crying out against the sytematic infiltration of corporate power and greed into every area of life. In this courageous work, Gerry Spence takes on what he calls, the &quot;oligarchical&quot; power of the  corporate world, exposing its manipulation of even our most personal  beliefs. On issues from the environment, police brutality, polital  corruption and homelessness, to the dominating influence that this power  has on the individual level, he leaves no stone unturned in his search for  justice in America. Anyone who is interested in the social problems of our  country will find this book a great source of knowledge, insight, and even  outrage. This book simply asks the reader to look at American society as it  is, not as it was taught to many of us in public school, and then think  about how these problems can be overcome+books
Not enough ideas for me+N+I wanted a good face painting book to use with my three-year-old, but this  book wasn't much help.  It has a good tiger and clown.

Le Mystère Magnifique!+P+Beatrice "Bede" Dunn became fascinated with wild orchids when she got a summer job with the Ontario Ministry of the Environment. They sent her to the Bruce Peninsula to map orchids. She spent three months there, wandering around the woodlands, doing some serious hiking and camping-out. When she returned in the fall with fifty rolls of film, she had a new avocation - wild orchid hunting. Bede became passionate about "documenting the existence of a single flower or the breeding ground of a particular species." In 1984 she and her boyfriend, Scott, went on a hiking holiday in the Dordogne region of southwestern France. When it began to rain, the couple had an argument about whether to leave their camp and seek shelter elsewhere or to stay put. Bede was adamant about remaining and so she did - alone. When Scott returned two days later the tent and their things were still at the campsite, but Bede was gone, along with her camera, backpack, Michelin guide and a book on wildflowers and orchids. No one ever saw the young woman again. After a massive search and investigation, which garnered much publicity, no evidence of foul play was discovered, no body, no crime scene.   Mara Dunn, Bede's identical twin, has never resigned herself to the loss of her sister. She moved to the Dordogne after her divorce became final and went into the interior design business, all the while maintaining contact with the police. Nothing concrete, however, was found concerning the disappearance. During an antique hunting expedition in a near-by town, Mara discovered an old Canon camera in a pile of junk. She noticed it immediately, even though the case was mildewed and worn, because it was identical to the cameras her parents had given her and her sister for their high school graduation. She was sure it was the camera her sister had traveled to France with. Inside the case the initials "B. D." were written, and inside the camera was an undeveloped roll of film. Damaged by time and dampness, but still viable, thirty-four photographs were revealed upon development, of wild orchids and a dovecote, taken in what appears to be the local landscape. Mara is convinced the photographs document her sibling's final days.   Now, almost twenty years after Bede vanished, Mara, with the photographs in hand, makes yet another effort to find her sister, or her remains. Julian Wood is an English expatriate living in Dordogne and an expert on wild orchids. He is also the author of "Wildflowers of the Dordogne/ Fleurs sauvages de la Dordogne," and the man Mara wants to assist her. She asks him to help her retrace her sister's footsteps using the photographs as a guide. Julian is skeptical about turning up anything new on the missing woman. He doesn't really want to get involved and he doesn't care much for pushy, intense women. Besides, the police have copies of the photographs and don't seem very excited by them. When Julian views the final picture though, he becomes agitated and as motivated to begin a search as Mara, but for different reasons. The photo is of a Cypripedium - Sabot de Venus in French, sometimes called Lady's Slipper in English. And since this rare wild orchid does not grow in the Dordogne, or anywhere in Europe, he has his own mystery to unravel - if he decides to become involved with Mara and her investigation.   Not only is "Deadly Slipper" a good literary mystery, it is really a fun book to read. Filled with an exotic cast of characters - from the local bogeyman and his mother, who is even scarier than her son, to the bizarre Sauvignac family, (the local nobility), to Julian Wood's fanatic orchid hunting nemesis and competitor, and the regulars down at Chez Nous, the town's cafe/bar/gourmet restaurant, plus a French police inspector and his lads, these personages all enrich the narrative. The horticulture tidbits are fascinating, and I'm no gardener. The description of food, wine, the gorgeous countryside - c'est tres magnifique! The setting IS France! There is even some romancing going on in between gruesome discoveries. You cannot go wrong, especially if you're looking for something different in sleuthing. JAN+books
WHAT CAN I SAY....+P+I purchased, "A Second Treasury of Knitting Patterns, and is most pleased.  The book is thorough and well written.  I love how Barbra Walker's guides you through some of the more challenging stitches.  This book is the definitive on stitches.  Some people complain about the black and white pictures.  It doesn't bother me a bit, it allows me the creativity to imagine what my color selections will look like.  Every knitter should own the  book.   I am so glad that the book was re-released.

It's a tad on the Euro-Socialist side, but Marcus isn't a bad artist+N+I thought the art had a certain charm, and used strictly as a picture book for children who can't yet read, I think it's quite nice.  (Too bad you can't make up your own story to go with it.)  The moment the child starts to read, though--better hide it quick, because...  Unfortunately, the book reads like a condensed Communist Manifesto for kids (as others have noted), or a Socialist agenda primer.  I don't know for sure that's what Marcus Pfister had as an aim, and I'm not going to speculate on his politics.  He has three kids and may raise them as he likes, and indulge in any such philosophical musings as float his boat.  Yes, I suppose sharing is nice.  Certainly sharing one's talents and abilities for the betterment of others is a great thing--but in America, we get paid for that (charity is voluntary, not coerced).  Furthermore, stripping yourself of what makes you unique and interesting (not necessarily BETTER, just unique and interesting), or giving away all your possessions, is a lousy way to make and keep friends, isn't it?  Is this book implying that somehow friendship can only be obtained by placating envy (a negative personal quality that should be dealt with by self-examination and intent to change, not pandering)?  Is it saying that being interesting and having unique qualities is bad?  Almost seems like it, at least to me.  Furthermore, there's an overtone of "only by belonging to a group can you have self-worth," which is as hoary a case of balderdash as ever I've seen.  Of course, people who agree with that egregious sentiment will disagree with me, but that won't make them right.  (The two stars, if you must know, are for the art.+books

The Planned Destruction of Social Security+P+The `Preface' by James Roosevelt Jr. says Social Security racks up surpluses as it had done for decades and will continue to do so. The special interests who want to "reform" Social Security really want to weaken or abolish it. So it is up to the American people to protect it in order "to promote the general welfare". Al Franken's `Foreword' wastes its pages on comic comments. The `Introduction' says Bush's scam would be both risky and costly, they use scary stories to fool people into believing their lies. Most Americans don't trust Bush (p.4). Conason warns about the "United Seniors Association" created to scare people into sending them money (p.5)! Powerful financiers want to destroy Social Security (p.6). They use phony fronts to fool people (p.8). Complaints and lies about Social Security go back to 1936; they have been proven false repeatedly (p.10). They can't learn and can't forget.  Here's how this fraud would work. They promised a lucrative return on "personal" accounts but didn't tell that management fees and substantial risks would drain these accounts. They promised the owner of the account would control their money but didn't tell that choice would be limited. They promised these accounts would be inherited but didn't tell you this would need an annuity that would leave little to heirs. They promised that Social Security would go bankrupt but didn't tell you this contradicted their prediction of increased growth in the economy. Heads they win, tails you lose. In the real world, people making these promises on investments would go to jail.  Chapter 1 explains when Bush says he wants to "strengthen" Social Security he really wants to reduce benefits (p.22). Conason neglects to tell that in 1952 Eisenhower promised to extend Social Security to the middle-class by including small business owners and farmers. He did this in 1953. There is no crisis in Social Security, and won't be if economic growth continues. If growth is slow private investments will suffer (p.29). Chapter 2 tells about the various publicity groups formed to attack Social Security with lies and half-truths. Conason names the corporations who pay for these advertising attacks. They simply lied about privatization (p.49)! Billions were squandered by Bush on tax cuts for the super-rich (p.50). Conason explains the frauds of the privatizers (p.56). Privatization was renamed "Choice" (p.57).  Chapter 3 tells about the phony groups who either mislead people to try to defraud them. They make up "facts" to try to prove their case (pp.67-68). This chapter tells of their techniques to divide and conquer (p.74). The AARP opposed Bush's failed proposal, and described the essential elements for a retirement plan (p.77). AARP won't tear down the house because of a clogged drain (p.78). Does the description of "United Seniors Association" on pages 79-83 expose their hidden agenda? Chapter 4 tells about the plans of Wall Street to swindle private accounts (p.86). Private accounts are losers compared to Social Security (p.89). Bush's plan to privatize Social Security because of a lack of popularity (pp.104-105). "You can't fool all of the people all of the time." Social Security was the best-working government program.  The `Conclusion' points out that Bush has not provided an actuarially sound plan to deal with an alleged future crisis in Social Security (pp.109-110). The proposed change could not work. The projected outlook for Social Security over the next 75 years is reasonably good (p.114). [The real problem is falling real wages and too high taxes.] There are other real solutions (p.117-121).+books
Want to learn wireworking? Start with this book!+P+When I decided to teach myself how to work with wire (especially wrapping cabs and other decorative work), I bought several books, and this one is definitely the best for learning. The illustrations are clear and easy to understand (important for me since I'm a visual learner), and the text is informative and easy to read (though not dumbed-down). I've done several of the projects so far and had no trouble (aside from my own general lack of dexterity) completing each of them, with attractive results. The other books just didn't work for me to get started, though I might be able to use them better now that I really understand the basics. If you already have the basic skills, you won't need this, but if you want to learn, start here+books
Mockery v. Truth+P+Evolutionist 1:  Gee...how can we vent our frustration over the truth in this book? Evoultionist 2:  You mean....you actually read the book...you're not just panicking blindly??? Evoultionist 1:  Well...I didn't read it all...just some quotes on the internet... Evolutionist 2:  OK....so...how do we censor these scientists and academics...make sure that noone actually reads these books?  I mean...this is a free country...we can't just burn the books or get the the government to conceal the truths in these books from children!!! Evolutionist 1:  Well...we're working on that last one... Evolutionist 2:  I got it!  Why don't we just make fun of the whole lot of anti-evolutionists using straw men and petty sarcasm!  Noone will ever see through that as a feeble self-righteous attempt to keep people's heads buried in the sand!  After reading OUR pseudo-review, people will HAVE to continue worshipping Naturalist saints and those yet to come that will prove evolution against all the current evidence!   Evolutionist 1:  You're right!  Instead of actually reading the books, we could could spend hours of our own free time writing these false reviews all over the internet!  We're prophets of Darwin, Gould, and Dawkins!   Evolutionist 2:  Wait...won't the intelligent design people just censor us or try to make US look stupid? Evolutionist 1:  Oh no...don't worry about that...We control the mass media AND the schools...and, as for making us look stupid?  I think we're doing a pretty good job of making ourselves look stupid, don't you??? Evolutionist 2:  Uhh....I don't get it+books
Not all that good+N+This book is a huge disappointment-it leaves out 80%of the movie,and the pictures are only so-so.I don't recommend this boring book to anyone who's a die-hard Poppins fan.All kids will do is look at the pictures to cure boredom,then toss the book aside and forget about it+books
FOR 2 YEARS OR OLDER CHILD+P+It is a great book for young ones to learn about Shapes.  My 13 months old son is not in to shapes yet but I will use this book onces he learns about shapes.  Buy this book if your toddler already can recognize the shapes and can sit with you while you read this book.  It is a activity book. +books
Excellent book to enjoy scoring a game !+P+If you think you know the baseball rules completely you must read this book first...! It's an excellent companion to the Official Rules of the game. If you love the game, you'll love this book !+books
Practical advice from an experienced practitioner+P+Hallinan's book presents a balanced tour of the basic knowledge required for an embedded Linux design effort. The subject is exceedingly large and the author wisely chooses to focus on essentials such as tools, debugging, and architecture. There is less emphasis on quickly dated material such as source code tours and build instructions as is found in other texts. This book will add to your knowledge... not just your script library.  Two attributes of this text are notable: a) This is the only text on the market with an overview of the latest CONFIG_RT technology found in the Linux kernel. CONFIG_RT is a new way of reaching real time performance requirements that does not depend on sub-kernels or interrupt abstraction. b) The author remains true to making this a "primer". This is an ideal book to start with and lay the foundation for future learnin+books

Wallmart On-Line+N+I never received the product despite desperately trying to correct your error in persisting to consider my two-year's old address current.  And because you refuse to have any vital contact with your customers but merely treat them as numbers I've decided never to do business with your Brave New World monolith again.  Thanks for nothing.  The money I lost due to your policy of disconnectedness from your buyers was well worth the result+books
What indeed?+N+Nietzsche, who started all this, may or may not have been the deepest thinker since Socrates, but he was a stylistic virtuoso. Deleuze and Guattari, on the other hand, were founder members of a postmodern cult whose watchword is: obscurity = profundity. But while some profound things may be ineluctably obscure, by no means all obscure things are profound.  This book, which runs to 250 pages scarcely burdened by a coherently expressed thought, is in line for the prestigious prize, the Golden Merde de Taureau. It contains, along with much else, the authors' mature lucubrations on the foundations of calculus, which have greatly impressed readers who flunked high-school math. Others maintain that these passages are not about mathematics at all, just as the passages about science are not about science, and they may be right. What, if anything, it is about is anyone's guess, and many have speculated, some to their own satisfaction. One thing we can be sure of, because the authors tell us: they are creating concepts. This important work should not be undertaken by those in whom unfortunate defects of education have left a residual respect for language and joined-up thought.  The book was a bestseller in France - possibly the most unread bestseller since a 'A Brief History of Time', but for different reasons+books
Save Your Money+N+This book makes saltwater aquariums seem easier than they actually are. For one, I don't even think the book mentions the use of reverse osmosis or deionized water, which is strongly recommended by all marine aquarists. The author also doesn't mention the importance of live rock. In fact, he goes as far to advise against using live rock for fish-only tanks! Sure, you might be able to get away with not using live rock, but it won't be worth it in the long run. Also, I don't agree with the list of recommended filter combinations. One more thing, the book lists an air stone as essential equipment, but the only thing an air stone will do is aid evaporation and cause salt creep! If you have enough movement of water at the surface, you should get sufficient gas exchange. There is, however, one thing the book does get right: its strong recommendation of using a protein skimmer.  This book is easy to understand, but you won't be getting the best information+books
Somewhere In The Darkness- Walter Dean Myers+P+I have read this book. It is an exhilarating story with jam-packed thrills and adventures.+books
Tedious+N+My main interest in reading the book was for the information about the Nazi fascination with the Occult.  I was hoping for something as stimulating as Mel Gordon's HANUSSEN: HITLER'S JEWISH CLAIRVOYANT.  I was greatly disappointed.  Christopher Hale's HIMMLER'S CRUSADE doesn't really deliver what it promises.  Hale basically pooh-poohs anything connected with the occult, asserts that only Himmler took such notions seriously (but was indulged by those seeking favors from him) and then moves on to other matters.  The book draws no real conclusion other than "Nazis were evil," which it pounds repeatedly throughout the book.  (I think I knew that before I even started reading the book.)  Hale never seems to be sure of exactly which story he is telling.  For a while it seems as though the book is about Schaeffer, who led the expedition, then toward the end, it drops him altogether and starts giving detailed biographical information about other members of the expedition (and the people with whom THEY interacted).   The author goes off on lots of tangents, giving unessential details about minor figures and events that had little bearing on the main story.  After having invested several weeks in reading the book, I am not sure what the point of it was.    The most interesting parts of the book were those that took place in Tibet, but the trip to Tibet actually takes up only about half the book.  The rest is a long-winded recounting of the rise and fall of Nazism.  It seems to me that here we have yet another book written by someone completely lacking a literary sensibility.  The author, Christopher Hale, is a British TV documentarist.  This book is an appendix to his TV show.  I found it very difficult reading.  In addition to its lack of focus, I just don't think Hale is very comfortable with the printed word.  There are pages and pages wherein it seems he is giving verbal descriptions of documentary film footage.  Perhaps his TV show was interesting, but the book was a chore to read.  In addition, the author has this maddening habit of inserting inflammatory opinions into his narrative, apropos of nothing and lacking supporting evidence.  Several times throughout the book, the author, a Briton, makes outlandish parallels between America and Nazi Germany, which he doesn't bother to back up (because he can't).  Perhaps one can get away with this in a TV documentary, but not in a book, where the reader can back up and say, "Wait a minute.  That's a bunch of crap.  Where is the evidence are you basing that statement on?"    The book is also rife with typographical errors (some of them giving an unintentional double entendre when for example "role" is spelled "roll") and misusages of words.  It appears to have not been edited at all.  I give this book one and a half stars, but let's round it off to two just for the research the author has done.  (His bibliography is probably of a lot more use than the book.)  I just wish he had been able to put all this research into a more coherent form and told it in a way that was more comprehensible and more interesting+books

A Communication Chart for all Offices+P+What a helpful book on understanding our past, present, and future in communication. M. Rex Miller is clear and precise as to the breakdown of how we have learned from ancient times and how we will learn in the future. If you are worried about postmodern thought then this is the book to read because Miller shows how a new way of thinking and processing information can be very spiritually productive in a rapidly changing society and church+books
Delicious!+P+Well, LMB did it again. She completely beguiled me!  She has created yet a third Universe, after the Vorkosigan Nexus and the World of Chalion, and it is a really plausible fantasy. She introducted the notion of "ground", a mysterious life-force that pervades everything, from humans, through mosquitoes and fireflies, down to rocks, glass bowls and shards thereof, and can be perceived by the Lakewalkers "groundsense". And this notion is very central to the plot ("ground" comes so early that mentioning it is not a spoiler). So certainly the book is a fantasy, and quite a well-constructed one. It is also romance, and a very sweet romance it is. Of course, it is not a book, just half of one. The ending is not an end, you really are left waiting for the second half. But the cutting point is well-chosen, I think I'll survive till "Legacy" comes out on July 1st. But just barely..+books
If at all interested, a must-read+P+Firstly, I must say that it is very difficult to summarize this book in any way. The complexity (and importance) of the material is such that there is no substitute for a direct, mindful read. However, if you are looking for a very worthwhile attempt at summarization, I suggest you read the review by ABC "bb" (I was persuaded to purchase by this review).  Many reviewers have commented that "Choosing Reality" is an "easy read". While I do agree to an extent, it seems necessary to note that these comments are true only in relation to other books of the same nature. Considering the complexity of the subject matter, yes, this book is an easy read. In comparison to most literature, however, this "easy read" statement is perhaps less plausable. My point is this: do not expect this book to be simple (firstly, because it isn't; secondly, because it shouldn't be). This is of double importance if the reader is of a traditional, Western mindset. The content of "Choosing Reality" (especially the latter chapters) takes time to fully absorb.  In fact, this book was, for me, the anti-thesis of a 'quick read'. That said, I must say that I enjoyed every long minute of it.  Wallace does a wonderful job showing the flaws in scientific realism and instrumentalism, chronicaling the histories and the theories of each. He then thoroughly explains the comprimise, the middle way, the Buddhist way: a centrist view of reality. While the presentation of the centrist view was invaluable in its own right, the most enjoyable sections of the book came after this presentation. Wallace undertakes the very difficult task of using language to describe how the centrist view can be applied to our lives. Rather than just offering a theory, he describes how the centrist view deals with the mind, the nature of "physical reality", and the illusory "self". The author earnestly argues that the implications of the centrist view are real; implications that will certainly force you to re-evaluate the world you live in. The beauty of this book is that it caters to any audience. There is enough science to make it rational and reasonable; there is enough Buddhism to make it real and applicable. I consider this book of utmost importance to anyone interested in modern physics, Buddhism, the nature of reality, and/or the self.  Finally, I must note that as much as this book is a religious view of science, it is equally (albeit more subtly) a scientific view of religion. As perhaps Wallace's greatest triumph in this book, modern science and religion are shown to be infinintely complimentary, both ultimately striving to understand the same things: the nature of reality and our role in it. To this end, "Choosing Reality" is a must read+books
a great explanation of religion from several disciplines+P+This was used as the primary textbook for my senior seminar as a religion major in college. Pals provides a great introduction to the major theories of religion, which we then used to help us understand the primary writings of Freud, Eliade, Marx, Durkheim, Geertz and others. In the years since taking the class, this is one of the few books that I have recommended to a number of friends along the way who have been interested in learning more about religion from a philosophical/academic standpoint+books
Sounded great, but didn't work for me+N+I thoroughly enjoyed reading Nancy's book, and it sounded as though it would be the perfect answer for my fitting problems. But, when I tried to utilize her techniques, nothing fit at all. It was a big disappointment+books
Disappointing, not for families or budget watchers+N+I purchased this book after reading the reviews on Amazon.  All those 5 star reviews convinced me!  They were wrong.  I find more help in the owners manual I received with my new electric pressure cooker!  Too many speciality ingredients that I don't even know where to buy, much less whether we like or not. Too many ingredients in general.  I was looking for down home, easy, family-type meals, and found &quot;gourmet&quot; type recipes.  I now check out the customer reviews rather than the &quot;experts&quot; and I read the reviews more carefully and watch for key words like simple, few ingredients, family, ingredients I find on my shelves, etc.  I also check out table of contents when offered+books
How to mulch effectively and inexpensively+P+As a novice gardener, I found this book to be extremely informative and inspiring in my quest to create the perfect mulch. The quick reference guide is very useful in that it provides necessary information about each  type of mulch, such as decomposition speed, soil moisture retention and  relative cost. I also found the section of definitions especially helpful  in trying to determine the best mulch for my garden. It's amazing how many  different common products can be used to create a mulch that is rich in  nutrients, appealing to the eye and terrific in water retention. Overall, I  view this book as a strong addition to my library of gardening books+books
Shamanism In Europe+P+Yes, Ginzburg actually contends that the so-called &quot;witches&quot; of old Europe were in fact remanents of the old Shamanic cultures of Europe, and he does make an excellent arguement for it. I will admit, I do agree with him on some points. Shamanism is a universal phenomena, and yet (with the notable exception of the Lapps in Scandinavia and a few scattered myths and legends like Orpheus and Odin) Shamanism seems to have all but been absent in Europe, and this has always puzzled me. Certainly, had Shamanism been widespread in Europe, it probably would have survived well into the Christian era, just as it has in other parts of the world. As such, Ginzburg may be right on the money about the witch hunts and such. Regardless of your thoughts on the subject, this remains an excellent book. And if you like it, he has another book, entitled &quot;Night Battles&quot; about a community of Shaman in northern Italy+books
Nasty and Profane+N+This is a horrible book written from a very nasty point of view. Basically, this is a systematic dismantling of everything sacred about Judaism - to the point where the author actually uses the sacred name of God in the book. Obviously, the author knew that his use of the name of God would deeply insult those devoutly Jewish, and just as obviously, the author did not care if he insults deeply held beliefs.  It's important to understand that this is coming from a man that feels that what is now Israel will soon no longer exist as the Jewish homeland - and he demonstrates absolutely no concern for that, either.  No concern for the basics of the Jewish religion, disdain for the Jewish homeland, and disdain for the future of the Jewish race. Anti-religion, Anti-Judaism, Anti-Israel. There's a word for that+books
Entertaining Reading for Foodies+P+With Mark Kurlansky's reputation as one of the best food writers today, it was only a matter of time before a collection of some of his selections of good food writing came together.  &quot;Choice Cuts&quot; is entertaining reading, especially for those who are interested in the history of eating and food.  There are few recipes in this book, but this collection is more of a book that you sit down with a cup of coffee or tea after you've finished the dishes+books
Waste of time+N+This book was an incredible waste of time. I felt that the essays were a) far too dated (a rambling discourse on the dangers of cookies) or b) too out of touch (Rape in cyberspace was NOT a real rape in cyberspace, folks) The authors seem to be mainly scholars without a tech background than technical folks and I have to agree that the thesaurus was in heavy use during the writing of most of the these essays. Finally the book contains very little practical information on cyberethics. Not even a single case study+books
Vegas Would Be A Ghost Town!+N+After reading this book as I did, you may have a great feeling of confidence and a new interest in the game of craps. Don't get carried away though. There are studies that refute any influencing of the dice by dice setters. The only studies mentioned are by those who are selling dice setter information. The methods in the book are certainly worth experimenting with, but not with your hard earned money. If you have been to Vegas recently its apparent that many people have read this book and are trying out the theory of dice setting. Does anyone think if dice setting took even a tiny part of the casinos profit that it would be allowed to continue? I think casinos love people who have read this book and try to beat the game+books
Really disappointed+N+This book is lame.  It's black and white drawings are sloppy and they don't instruct.   There is little or no instructions This book is way over priced.  Stay away from it+books
Highly recommended+P+Confused by all the hoopla around the "Natural Horsemanship" gurus these days? Find out what is the real thing by reading Alois Podhajsky's "My Horses, My Teachers." In fact, this book could be a sourcebook in Human Relationship, or Self-Help categories as well as any equine category.  AP writes passionately about his relationships with his own gurus, the many horses who were lucky enough to cross paths with this kind, gentle, patient master of horsemanship. Reading this book one feels as if these stories are being told face to face with this beacon of horsemasters, sitting in his living room on comfortable couches. This is a must read for ANY horse enthusiast!+books
Ten weird, surprising, tense, comical, and often unforgettable stories+P+A family on vacation encounters a cold-blooded gang, a gullible and naive housewife is struck by a mysterious (but hilariously common) "illness," a 104-year-old Civil War veteran is a featured guest at his 62-year-old daughter's high school graduation--each of O'Connor's stories portray characters in improbable, bizarre, and ultimately harrowing situations. These tales are weird, surprising, tense, comical, and often unforgettable--but what exactly do they all mean?  O'Connor was often frustrated by the sense that readers and reviewers misunderstood both the intents and the themes of her stories. In her first letter to a fan from Atlanta who became a frequent correspondent, she complained that "she was mighty tired of reading reviews that call 'A Good Man' brutal and sarcastic" and that "when I see these stories described as horror stories I am always amused because the reviewer has hold of the wrong horror."  I think she sells herself short with this assessment, however. Her stories are brutal, they certainly can be sarcastic--and the fact that readers confuse the horror is confirmation of the ambiguous and harrowing (and, yes, Gothic) underworld her characters inhabit. The reason her stories are classics of the form--and the ten stories in this collection are among the best I've ever read--is not only because they are creepy and grotesque, or because she is the master of the ominous set-up and the unexpected ending, but also because after you've found out what happened you'll probably lie awake wondering why it happened.  "Christian realism" was how O'Connor described her spiritual stance; "I write the way I do because (not though) I am a Catholic. . . .  I am a Catholic peculiarly possessed of the modern consciousness." Decades of critics have argued over the theological underpinnings of her fiction, but an assessment by a fellow author named George Clay helped me make sense of her themes--and the author herself approvingly summarized his remarks in her own correspondence: "[Clay's] interesting comment was that the best of my work sounded like the Old Testament would sound if it were being written today--in as much (partly) as the character's relation is directly with God rather than with other people's." It's not hard to find the ghosts of Job, Ruth, Samson, Esther, Isaac, Daniel, and others in all of her stories.   Whether these echoes make for good theology will depend on the reader's own spiritual inclinations--but they certainly make good reading. My favorite piece in this collection is "Good Country People," probably O'Connor's most famous (excepting the title story). Describing a lonely woman with an artificial leg who is seduced by a traveling Bible salesman, the story veers into an inexplicable climax that is both devastating and melancholy. And those two words pretty much sum up any of the stories you'll find here+books
Absolutely brilliant+P+I bought these for my daughter aged 5, but I have found that both my 5 and 7 year are obsessed with these dolls.  Its 5 months now since I gave them to her, and still (beyond one very beneficial Christmas!) they return time and time again to hours of play with the paper dolls.  Needless to say, playing with the paper dolls then leads to hours of dressing up themselves like the brides..+books
"Hooked on Art" - Teachers Guide for Grades Kindergarten-Sixth+P+This book is of great use for elementary school teachers.  I got a copy when it was first published several years ago and have given several copies to teachers.  When teaching elementary school students, as I did, things must be kept simple.  This is not only true because of the availability of supplies but, also, the ability of the students and supervision needed in teaching the art process.  The author had years of teaching experience and it shows in the instructions given - - - particularly, for those of us who don't have a great artistic talent ourselves.  I purchased my most recent copy for a young friend who is starting her first year of teaching in the fourth grade.  I hope that she uses it and enjoys it+books
WOW! Great book!+P+Wow is right! This book will keep you on your toes the whole ride through!I first thought this book was going to be boring but I was wrong! This book is exciting and will keep you waiting for more. I think you should read this book. Will Peter and the Defense Club get all the gold to the Cleeng Peerson? This book is full of questions. The book is set in Riswyk, a city in Norway. Read This book! Trust me, you won't want it to end+books
Big disappointment+N+I used to enjoy Iris Johansen.  This book is a super natural psychic thing. The book flap describes it as "psychological thriller", but it's not.  If you enjoy the super natural type of book (Stephen King, etc) then this is good.  If, like me, you dislike that type of book, STAY AWAY from this one.  The main character Kerry can get into peoples minds.  The other main character also does that.  Yes,that is the basis of this book+books
A must for anyone in the baking and or cake business+P+This book is an essential part of mine and my partners dessert catering company and was recommended to us by our chef & mentor in baking school. It contains highly valuable information on every level of the spectrum regarding the fine art of constructing cakes and like mediums. Often used as a reference manual and has never let us down.+books
Lieber at his very best+P+Imagine a world where the church ran everything.  Sound good?  Well, it's not.  Just like in the middle ages, this church rules with an iron hand.  Since God must be with the church, then opposition to the church is considered witchcraft, and it seemingly comes from Satan.  A wonderful view of the negative possibilities should one single religion ever really take over the world.  Lieber is a master writer, and this is one of his very best novels+books
An insightful history of the black aesthetic+P+In Black Beauty: A History And A Celebration, Ben Arogundade offers a comprehensive and insightful history of the black aesthetic ranging from the days of slavery and its necessity to dehumanize blacks, to the evolution of black cosmetic products, images and hairstyles, to modern day icons of film, television, music, sports, and fashion. This impressive anthology is profusely illustrated throughout with photography from Annie Leibovitz, David Baily, Albert Watson, Herb Ritts, Peter Lindbergh, and others. Black Beauty is impressive, informative, inspiring, occasionally iconoclastic, and a superb addition to any personal, academic, or community library Black Studies collection+books
The Final Bow of the Musketeers+P+Before you start this book you should know that any resemblance between the book and the movies that Hollywood has turned out is completely accidental. The names of the main characters are about the only similarity that I could find and as is the norm, the book was much better.  This, the last installment in the Musketeer series, gives us the story of the final acts of our heroes, Athos, Porthos, Aramis and D'Artagnan. Unlike many literary characters our Musketeer friends have aged as the story progresses and have all retired but D'Artagnan who is still the Captain of the King's Musketeers. Athos and Porthos are quite wealthy and Aramis has attained the rank of Bishop. Aramis is not content with his station however and knows a secret that he thinks he can use to become Pope. This secret is the knowledge that Louis XIV has a twin brother who is hidden away in the Bastille and Aramis is quite sure that this brother would make a better King than the current monarch. Aramis is also pretty sure that the new King in gratitude will nominate his liberator for the office of Cardinal and then will scheme to make the new Cardinal Pope.  In this plot Aramis acts alone except for some help from Porthos who has no idea what he is involved in. The twins are successfully switched for a short while but then the plot falls apart and Aramis and Porthos flee for their lives although Porthos is still not sure what is going on. The "pretender" to the throne is left to his own devices by Aramis and is imprisoned in a new location with the iron mask added to his discomfiture. Aramis does not come across in this book as much of a hero and in many respects this story is much darker than it's predecessors.   Given the advanced age of the Musketeers, there are not nearly as many swashbuckling adventures as one is accustomed to but on occasion Porthos in particular will rise to the challenge. The political intrigues of the Court of Louis XIV and the decline of the Musketeers are in fact the main plot lines of this story. In the end, only one of the four is left and to find out which one you will just have to read the book. Athos, by the way, only seems to play a side role in this story and is neither involved in the plot against the King or in his rescue.   As is always the case, Dumas' writing style is superb and is filled with historical fact. He does tend to be a bit wordy and his books are often much longer than necessary but even with this slight drawback he ranks as one of my all-time favorite authors. In this book Dumas closes out the careers of his most popular characters and he does it with style+books
Nothing like what iowa's Cousin Rick Black Has!! Give us The Deer Burger Cookbook anytime!+N+Cut and Dry.. Iowa's Cousin Rick Black is by far the leader with us deer hunters and how we cook our harvest. I got a copy of 301 Venison Recipes from my uncle. I asked him why he was tossing it out? His reply?

The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana+N+As an Eco fan, I could not wait to read his latest novel. Sadly, I was deeply disappointed by this pompous, self-indulgent, virtually unreadable monster. The cultural and literary references are obscure and incomprehensible unless you are a 70-something Italian librarian.   +books
Incredible biography+P+This revised version of the Gelb's famous biography from the sixties is an incredible read.  It traces the life of O'Neill from his early beginnings  to his first Broadway play, Beyond the Horizon.  One gets an in-depth view  of his life with his parents and brother.  Monte Cristo provides the modern  reader with an enriched biographical background that really elucidates  aspects of O'Neill's masterwork, Long Day's Journey Into Night.  This  biography is clearly written, thoughtful, provocative, and interesting.   It's definitely one of the great literary biographies of an American  writer+books
BORING+N+This book is plainly boring in every way. The plot should be replaced and the character was completely and utterly uninteresting. The first half of the story deserved a whopping rating of negative 2 stars, and the second half deserved roughly one star. If you have any intention of reading a book that you will cherish in your heart, then I suggest that you would please disregard this novel and find one that is more interesting, like "Barney Goes to the Zoo". Do not, and I repeat: DO NOT read this book. If you would like to take interest in this novel, save your money and check it out of the library or borrow it from a friend. You WILL be disappointed+books

falsely profound and profoundly false+N+About 9/11, B writes, "At a pinch we can say that they did it, but we wished for it. . . . We are far beyond ideology and politics now. . . . As if the power bearing these towers suddenly lost all energy, all resilience; as though that arrogant power suddenly gave way under too intense an effort: the effort always to be the unique world model."  Despite the silliness of these ideas, here and there B does make an interesting point.  But the book exists primarily to exhibit B's cleverness rather than to illuminate terrorism.+books
Karen Rose-I'm Watching You+P+Just having discovered Karen Rose, I loved Don't tell, but was disapointed with Have You Seen Her.  I thought I'm Watching You was way better and I am glad I was not disappointed a second time.  I'm Watching You combined all the essentials: suspense, great plot, developed, likeable characters with a past, and non-stop plot twists and turns.  The romantic piece of the story was written in well, and was not overpowering as in Have You Seen Her.  I can't wait for Rose's next novel+books
I love this book!!+P+This is a great book for a very young child, I started reading it to my daughter at 1. It doesn't go into detail about a birthmother or the actual adoption process. In fact Choco looks for a mom like him and finds love in a family that is very different, but is very happy and loving. My little girl loves this book and enjoys the bright pictures of the various animals. I love that it opens the door to explain that loving families can look different from each other... and that is OK!!!

As if by magic!+N+Daniel Dennett's excellent book Consciousness Explained extracts a very funny cartoon from Scientific American, in which two professors stare at a blackboard showing a formula full of complex algebra. In the middle of the formula appears the sentence, "THEN A MIRACLE OCCURS". One professor points to the statement and says to the other, "I think you should be more explicit here in step two."  Roger Penrose isn't just any old boffin: he is the Emeritus Rouse Ball Professor of Mathematics at Oxford University and has been knighted for his services to Science. The Emperor's New Mind is his attempt to crack that perennial philosophical chestnut, the Consciousness/Artificial Intelligence problem. Penrose's view is that Strong AI is simply wrong and that a computer could never replicate (functionally or actually) what we know as "consciousness".  Right. Take a deep breath here. For it's a scary thing for a mere mortal (with a decidedly ordinary bachelor's degree in the humanities) to say something like this about the one of the cleverest men on the planet, but I can't see any way around it: In this book Roger Penrose completely, totally, misses the point. Insofar as it's considered an entry on the Consciousness/AI debate, The Emperor's New Mind - all 583 pages of it - is all but worthless.  There. I said it.   Then again, nearly 500 of those pages don't even purport to be about consciousness, so perhaps all is not lost. Instead, they contain an extremely dense, at times fascinating, but uniformly (and I use the word deliberately) dazzling overview of the more esoteric parts of modern mathematics, physics and cosmology. While Penrose thinks it is necessary background, it isn't - it amounts to an extremely long winded appeal to authority:  One is left with the firm impression that the Rouse Ball Professor of Mathematics at Oxford University is a very, very smart chap, and that one really ought to see that what ever he says goes. This is no small irony, given the title of his book. For if anyone is holding himself out as being a tailor purveying a cloth that only the cleverest people can see, it's Roger Penrose.  Here's where I think he goes wrong. Firstly, his attempt to undermine the AI position is founded on purely mathematical reasoning. Pure mathematics is a closed logical system. Its truths aren't falsifiable, so by themselves have no explanatory force. Mathematical statements (such as "1+1=2") are necessarily true for all time and all universes so, ipso facto, they can't - by themselves - tell us anything about any particular universe. Yet that is just what Penrose asks them to do. He invokes Gödel's theorem of undecidability, perhaps to counter the argument I have just made, but it isn't convincing - being logically unable to prove all truths in a particular set (even though you know they are true) is very different from being able to falsify them. Without that power, you have no explanatory traction in the outside world.  Penrose's entire attack on Strong AI is based on an unfalsifiable, and therefore non-content carrying, argument.  Another error is to assume an algorithm must have been designed for the purpose for which it is used, and must work perfectly to be of any use. Natural selection illustrates that this is simply not the case. An algorithm may have a number of useful unintended by-products, and an algorithm can be extremely useful even when we know it to be completely misconceived at every level: take Newtonian mechanics as a good example. We've known for a century it isn't correct but in most practical circumstances it works fine.   Which brings me to my next point: for all the learning Penrose includes on Mandelbrot sets, phase space, entropy and Hawking Radiation, The Emperor's New Mind is conspicuous for what it leaves out: The bibliography contains no reference to Karl Popper nor the general philosophy of science - which might have helped him on the issue of falsifiability - nor crucially to a number of writers who have been very influential on the modern mind/AI question: Daniel Dennett is barely mentioned (Dennett's writing probably represents the "forefront" of the consciousness debate), nor is Richard Dawkins well-referenced, despite having written compellingly (and, being a zoologist, with a great deal more expertise) on the question of algorithms in natural selection. Indeed, Penrose doesn't clearly present the arguments of any particular supporter of strong AI, but rather chooses to generalise loosely as if he is convinced his mathematical deductions can carry the day, and that AI doesn't present a significant challenge. Douglas Hofstadter is given a little space, and John Searle and his largely discredited Chinese Room Experiment a fair space, but other than that the only philosopher Penrose seems to be aware of is Plato.  Another thinker Penrose doesn't seem familiar with is William of Occam. Instead of doing some background reading (and applying a little common sense), Penrose has launched a theory which (as he proudly proclaims) takes us to the ends of time and the universe and back to the smallest subatomic particles to explain (in ways he freely admits he doesn't understand) an everyday, prosaic (but still extremely hard to grasp) phenomenon. In its interstellar journey Penrose's theory drifts very close to dualism, and close (but not quite so close, perhaps) to positing (or needing) some sort of God to work. That will give succour in some quarters, but not the ones Penrose has in mind, I suspect.   Occam's Razor would require that such untestable and speculative suppositions be rejected unless no other explanation is available. Penrose would protest there are none; Dennett, Dawkins, Hofstadter and their colleagues and adherents (including me) would beg to differ, and point to a lot of literature that Penrose hasn't read. In any case one would think that Penrose's own intuition (which he claims helps him to see truth despite Gödel undecidability!) ought to help him see his theory is, as Jeremy Bentham would say, "nonsense on stilts".   Ultimately, when Penrose says "quantum theory explains consciousness" he is really saying no more than "something magic happens!" or even "THEN A MIRACLE OCCURS".  Mr Penrose, I think you should be more explicit here in step two.  Olly Buxton+books
An Exemplary Epistemology Text.+P+Sosa and Kim's text is a guide through the most influential and  provocative articles in philosophical epistemology.  Provides a good  background for issues regarding knowledge and skepticism, and includes  classic essays as well as contemporary journal articles.  Perfect for an  introductory graduate level epistemology course+books
You will never look at government the same.+P+Well researched and documented writing that takes the phony &quot;mask&quot; off many of our elected and non elected leaders. THere is a truth that is hidden behind the major news events of our era but it requires searching for. This book simply makes sense out of the murders of the Kennedys and MLK- motive/ who's who, and the those with the power to cover up the killings+books
The way history should be written+P+Alistair Horne's epic about Verdun is one of the best history books I have ever read.  He provides detailed information with the style which makes all the facts flow.  Not only does he detail the battle itself, but takes time out to describe the adventures of a German Sergeant Kunze who infiltrates Forts Douaumont.  What makes this chapter different is the almost minute by minute retelling of the soldier's activities.  He actually stops to eat in a fort surrounded by the enemy with prisoners he captured locked in a broom closet!   I have previously read How Far From Austerlitz? by Horne and enjoyed it as much as Verdun.  This book is the second in a three part trilogy covering the Franco-Prussian War (The Fall of Paris) and World War II (To Lose a Battle France 1940) All definitely worth the time to read.  +books

A perfect edition+P+This is an unbelievably great edition of The Canterbury Tales.  All I wanted was the original, complete version with definitions for archaic words.  But the Penguin Classics edition was all I could find, so I got it.  It comes with over 500 pages of extras!!!  Super-detailed notes, a great glossary, and lots on Chaucer, his times, literary genres, etc., etc.  Multiple interpretations are given for parts scholars don't agree on.  I can't believe I paid $80 for the Riverside Chaucer in college!  ...which I later sold back for much less.  This edition blew me away, and it's relatively cheap.  If you haven't read Chaucer and want to read him in old English, it's tough at first, but it gets easier with practice.  There are long tales, short tales, noble tales, bawdy tales, etc.  If you just want to read a few, there are cheaper paperbacks with just a few.  If you want the complete tales but not the essays and things, they exist, but they're more expensive than this edition+books
Interesting clips, but not a good book+N+It took me a couple months to get through this book.  Although there are many interesting clips [from the author's magazine interviews over the years], the book does not hang together.  It appears that the author attempted to weave the stories together into some kind of themes, by decade: but there is really no &quot;greater insight&quot; provided.  I would have preferred to read an anthology of more in-depth commentaries on a few female artists.  I also found Ms. Hirshey's ornate writing style to be difficult reading+books
'Tis Pity So Few People Know About This Play!+P+This is a highly emotional and well-written work that explores a very taboo subject matter.  The play revolves a case of forbidden love, in this case, Giovanni's incestuous love for his sister Annabella.  It's pretty easy to figure out after the first few pages that the play will have a tragic ending, but there are several major surprises that happen along the way, and the final scene is unbelievably violent.  I'd love the chance to stage a production of &quot;Tis Pity&quot; one of these days...from a directorial standpoint, the script is filled with many interesting possibilities+books
Excellent+P+This is an excellent book. For those interested in Edgar Cayce and for those interested in Universal MInd, God , Spirituality...etc..A Very good starting place...and a Easy read.. One of my favorite books as well..+books
Couldn't get past errors and arrogance+N+The authors of this book purport to tell the history of herb and plant use for religious purposes throughout history.  They especially focus on plants that have hallucinogenic, healing, or toxic qualities.    Only trouble is, I find it hard to trust the authors' word on how to use dangerous plants when they make errors so often in other areas.  For example, they claim that Henry VIII had syphilis, passed it on to his children, and therefore none of them lived past infancy.  Ummm...except for the *three* who grew up to rule England?  And in a table of plants sacred to various Greek goddesses, they mention that the pomegranate is sacred to Hera, but do not connect it to Persephone at all, which seems a pretty big oversight in light of her myth.  Then, they go on to talk about witches' flying ointments and how deadly they were--but ridicule modern witches who concoct less fatal blends to help them go into trance.  There may very well be treasures in this book.  I'd just be too afraid to trust the authors' accuracy+books
Van Gogh Cafe was magical to read.+P+The book I am reviewing is The Van Gough Café by Cynthia Rylant. I think book is great because it's so imaginative. This book is about a cafe where things happen. There really is no problem in this story. It is more about everything magical that happened in the cafe. I would recommend this book to everyone in my reading class. Another book Cynthia Rylant wrote is Wedding Flowers. This story deserves five stars! Emerson, NJ; Fifth Grade Studen+books
I was Awakended with this Book!+P+Dolores did a great at job interviewing Phil in her studies, I found myself realizing that it all makes sense. The historcal gaps in history seemed to be filled with his recounts of earths of civilization thousands of years ago. Not a typical  abduction case , but a true eye opener. I related to many things in the book and feel that so much has been confirmed with me. I can't wait for a follow-up with Phil. Personally I  Can't wait to read it again+books
Another Liberal Manifesto+N+Conservatives will probably dislike it.  Liberals will find it a good, fresh rally 'round the liberal flagpole.  I'm a liberal, so it was fun for me.  But have you noticed how the word &quot;community&quot; is becoming the new flashword among liberals?  &quot;We are all in this together,&quot; says Mario, so we had better take care of ourselves.  Like Hillary Clinton's &quot;It Takes a Village.&quot;  The use of &quot;community&quot; is like the use of &quot;opportunity&quot; by the conservatives.  Both are code words for points of view that, taken to their extremes, can be far more detrimental than helpful.  Americans ultimately prefer the middle.  Just remember that, folks, and no one will get hurt+books
in depth look at how London became a modern city +P+This is an in depth look at how London became a modern city through the early Victorian transition.  The insight starts with the key to any city the revision of the sewage system to eliminate the health problems and the odor that permeated much of the city from cesspits.  As fascinating is the role of women, which differs depending on social class; unlike romance novels, the author furbishes a powerful look at the growing factory and municipal working class, those below the poverty line, and the servant class too.  In these cases diaries and the writings of chroniclers like Jane Carlyle and Thomas Mayhew provide insight.  This is a terrific look at three decades of transformation of one of the world's greatest cities.  Readers who enjoyed the recently issued LONDON'S THAMES: THE RIVER THAT SHAPED A CITY AND ITS HISTORY as well as the author's previous captivating London historicals (see ELIZABETH'S LONDON and RESTORATION LONDON) will appreciate this deep look at the historical era of transformation of an urban center that never slept in the middle of the nineteenth century and still does not.

Just give up and get fat!!+N+That is the bottom line for this author.  She spends way too much time telling us to "embrace" our new, thick waistlines, and too little time on any real information or help.  Don't bother exercising. just give up and eat smaller amounts of whatever it is that made you fat in the first place, get 9 hours of sleep every night (good luck with that!) and eliminate all stress from your life. That's all you have to do, and then you'll only gain 10 pounds during menopause instead of 20 or 30.  Save your money+books
Another Pretty Book+N+There's no doubt that this is a gorgeous book.  Unfortunately, I think it's better for your coffee table than your kitchen.  While there are beautiful pictures (lots of Nigella) and several great recipes, the book didn't seem very useful to me.  I bought and loved "How to be a Domestic Goddess", so, I got this book from the library to check it out, thinking it would be somewhat the same.  I have to say I was dissapointed.  I only found 4 usable recipes in the whole book.   (Granted, I am not a gourmet chef by any means, but I do consider myself to be a lover of great food and a Good cook.) While there are some nice recipes and lots of great photos this book is a more of a "pretty to look at" picture book than a hard core recipe resource. +books
Beyond Boring+N+I read the first 20 pages of this snorer and couldn't continue. NOTHING happens! Why would I consider reading on? What's the first rule of writing a compelling novel?

Disappointing for the Educated Reader+N+The editors' review would lead you to believe this is an unbiased, thorough and scholarly examination of cultural anthropology.  It is not.  There is subtle age, gender, cultural and religious bias.  Although it is a thorough look at various cultures, it is by no means comprehensive or accurate.  It is inaccurate in highlighted descriptions of minor aspects of Native American culture, especially of the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Nation.  It seems to imply Western European cultures and various organized religions are the greatest evil on the planet.  The portrayal of some cultures, such as the Malaysian, Pacific Island, and a few of the African Bushmen cultures, are very nice but that is the only redeeming quality of this text.  Real scholars should avoid this text at all costs+books
A Pioneering Effort+P+When I first discovered that a new Burton biography by a professor of history was soon to be published I had high expectations. Upon receipt of Professor Kennedy's Burton biography titled The Highly Civilized Man, I started digesting his work. The asserted themes of the work included 1) placing Burton and his work in context with the larger issues and challenges of Victorian times, and 2) using Burton to better understand the nature of changes beginning to percolate socially due to the interaction of Victorian England with its colonial enterprises.  Indeed, as far as I know, this approach is pioneering and insightful. As I continued reading to about page 90, I thought Professor Kennedy's effort was well done, and the book would be another jewel to adorn the crown of Burton research, along with the work of Mary Lovell.  I am of the opinion Professor Kennedy succeeded in achieving both this stated objectives.  From this standpoint, his book is a success.  The observations of Burton as a harbinger bridging the transition from the Victorian Era to the Modern Era reflect the type of insights one expects from a biographer trained in the rigors of academic scholarship.  I enjoyed the in depth academic analysis of Burton from the standpoint of concepts of relativism as applied to notions of cultural difference.  Professor Kennedy has also highlighted the role played by Burton in the early development of anthropology as an academic discipline.  Social/Cultural Anthropology's primary research methodology is called participant/observation.  Certainly, this approach was an inherent part of Burton's nature, and the scope of his anthropological observations were derived by this research approach.  I was also glad to see that Professor Kennedy gave particular attention to discussing Burton's Stone Talk and his Kasidah.  The earlier biographies did not devote much attention to either of these important works.  As long as Kennedy stayed focused on academic based scholarship he avoided the pitfalls that plagued the earlier biographies that predated Lovell's Rage to Live. Unfortunately, the book digressed into complicated histories that are not fully recounted.  Yet, Professor Kennedy felt compelled to make several definitive conclusions sorely lacking the professional level of scholarship a professor should be required to meet.  The outcome of Kennedy's failures is a setback in Burton scholarship. Given the effort to place Burton in context, the irony is that the book with notable examples omits necessary context to understand and evaluate some of the Professor's conclusion. For example, the recounted history of Burton firing over the head of a crowd of Greek Orthodox Christians fails to acknowledge that Burton resorted to this solution after trying less violent alternatives, and after he and fellow members of his party were injured by rocks thrown at them.  The key point is that Burton used a hierarchy of options to confront unstable situations. This point also relates to the absurd conclusion that Richard and Isabel were role-playing in the desert, and that there is a hidden psychology to uncover.  The decision to have Isabel act as Richard's son was an attempt to protect her from rape and death, and to give Richard an option before resorting to lethal force.  The Burtons took their personal safety serious as illustrated by their habit of carrying two revolvers and three Bowie knives when traveling.    Professor Kennedy has a mildly obsessive theme about people Burton did not know going into the desert for homosexual interludes that randomly pops up in the book.  He includes a discussion of Burton and several earlier biographers who speculated about Burton's sexuality. But Kennedy failed to note those writers assumed Richard and Isabel had a loveless and sexless marriage, and they used outmoded, almost now quaint, modes of Freudian analysis. The illusion of the Burton's loveless marriage was gutted by the original sources brought to light by Ms. Lovell.  Professor Kennedy fails to point out the deficiencies of Brodie and Mclynn concerning their analysis of Burton and sexuality. The deficiencies in The Highly Civilized Man about the question of Burton's sexual interests are too numerous to address in a short review nor are the issues he raised concerning Damascus, Crowley and others. Kennedy's treatment of Burton in Damascus is a travesty. Not once does the professor inform the reader that all segments of society in Damascus worked to bring Burton back from his recall. The Damascus treatment is lacking in necessary detail and skewered to the degree that the discussion should have been deleted form the book. It is also one of the examples where Kennedy included information that is extraneous to accomplishing his two professed themes.   The book appears to have been written with segments produced using an academic analysis methodology with other portions written in an almost stream of consciousness with points lacking critical evaluation.  Moreover, there are instances of contradiction. This leads one to conclude the work was not scrutinized properly before going to press. The Kasidah analysis includes a conclusion that Burton believed there is no God or afterlife, yet in the chapter titled the Afterlife, Kennedy indicates Burton may have concluded there is continuing life. In fact, towards the end of the Kasidah and towards the end of note 2, Burton makes it plain he has a positive view on a continuing future life. It is not a life however with the attributes of anyone's religious acculturation. The chapter on the afterlife in large part is one of the commendable aspects of this biography.  All of the hallmarks of a work that will withstand the centuries are present in this work if only the good professor would later reissue it, and correct the many deficiencies and expand the themes of Burton as harbinger, Burton as catalyst, Burton as a pioneering mystic and Burton as scribe in the manner of Thoth, the Ancient Egyptian principle of wisdom.   +books
A Very  Mediocre Tour of the Arab World+N+I found this book to be a real disappointment. For starters, Lamb is a journalist rather than a scholar. Nothing wrong with that, except for the fact that much of the book reads like a "travelogue" based on anecdotes and personal encounters rather than a serious analysis of the Arab world. He certainly does not have the historical perspective or depth of knowledge of a true Middle East expert such as Bernard Lewis. This book might be somewhat informative to those just beginning to learn about the Arab world. But certainly there must be better "beginner" books out there.   Lamb also appears to have a very limited knowledge of factual information about the region, especially historical facts, as demonstrated by the substantial number of errors in the book. For example, he describes ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia as being Arab accomplishments. But these civilizations didn't consider themselves to be Arabs and certainly didn't speak the Arabic language, which Lamb himself later describes as the best criteria for determining who is Arab and who is not. The truth is that the Arabs were largely confined to the Arabian Peninsula until Muhammad, in the early 600's, united the Arab tribes under Islam and began the wars of conquest which were to eventually bring the Arabic language to what is now considered to be the Arab world, including Egypt and Iraq. Finally, the original edition of this book was written in 1987. The 2002 edition has been partially updated. But much of the book is still outdated. For instance, his writings on the political violence that wrecked Lebanon in the 1980's. The Arab world is a fascinating place. Please do it justice by finding a better book. +books
great overview of the industry, but ...+P+Dr. Dichter gives a wide range of examples based on real experiences that expose many of the pitfalls of development assistance as we know it.  Unfortunately, while his descriptions of the problems are quite comprehensive, his proposed solution (i.e. drastically cut development assistance in favor of private development) lacks much in the way of logical support.  For instance, there is no contrasting presentation of examples of privately-funded projects that have succeeded where charity has failed, nor any mention of to what extent business relies on government-funded infrastructure improvements, etc.  In addition, the topic is best addressed in two stages -- i.e., is it desirable to encourage development in other countries?  and, if so, are our current tactics the most effective and efficient ways to achieve this goal?   Dr. Dichter addresses only the second question, but seems to conclude that because the status quo is ineffective, the entire pursuit should be abandoned.  But in general the book is still highly worth reading if you're the least bit interested in development assistance -- it is both deeply enlightening and generally accessible. +books
The best book in the universe bar none except no substitutes Numero Uno etc....+P+Yes, this is my all-time favorite book, and it begins my all-time favorite series. Can you summarize the almost limitless appeal of Herriot? I will try. First of all, this book takes place in England, and I am a committed Angliophile. It is warm and compassionate without being soppy. It is a timeless memoir that cuts a slice out of the pie of time and keeps it forever. Prior to Herriot, I exclusively read fiction. Not just any fiction, but Science Fiction and Fantasy Fiction, both of which are as different from this book as jam is from vegemite (eeuurggh!). Reading Herriot made me realize that the old saying "Truth is stranger than fiction" left out something. Truth is BETTER than fiction. Enjoy wiht my compliments+books
More Than Just A Thriller+P+This is a terrific book on several levels.  First, just the love that these two women have for the people of Afghanastan and the picture they paint of life under the Taliban is interesting in and of itself.  In places it reads like a thriller, especially when they are arrested and their daring rescue.  Finally, just the incredible faith that these women exhibited under such trying circumstances is an inspiration to me.  Not that they are perfect, and they are the first to admit they struggled at times in those dark hours in prison, even bickering among themselves at times.  But in the end, their deep faith prevailed and a miracle occurred.   I felt like I was with them before, during and after their imprisonment, and that is a tribute to the great writing of this book.  And, by the way, much of the negatives reviews I've read here sound a lot more like anti-Christian bigotry then thoughtful criticisms.  Ignore them, and buy this inspirational, wonderful book+books

From A Great Teacher+P+Though the title implies it, this book is not really a sequal to the Six Easy Pieces. They can be read seperately. It treats some of the concepts centered around Special and General Relativity that revolutionized physics near the turn of the century. It would be impossible to find another book that can dive so deeply into topics such as symmetry and space-time, while bypassing formalism and exposing the fundemental ideas and signficance in every-day terms. The delivery is in lecture form, and while that makes it more authentic and real, the fact that this is a book and the reader is not really in a lecture, makes it a little awkward. One often gets the feeling that one had to be there to get the full benefit. There is little attempt at explaining the historical context and other niceties and focus is solely on the concepts themselves. One needs to have at least college level math background to follow the derivations. Feynman has done a phenomenal job in reducing such complex concepts into digestable pieces of conversation. There is no abstraction, everything is quantified. I especially enjoyed the chapter Curved Space, as I had never seen it treated so intimately. The self consistency of all these topics and how they are interrelated is elegantly presented.+books
Ultimately less satisfying than one would hope+N+Although in some ways provocative, this book poses a question it never adequately grapples with--namely, can the "materiality" of race be properly characterized or understood as a "discursive limit" to ideological constructions of ethnicity without being understood as existing outside of discourse? It seems to me that Eng fails to address the question of whether such constructions may be regarded as either a pre- or extra-discursive "hard kernel of the Real," one the one hand, or simply another aspect of discourse, on the other hand. His work would benefit from a more thorough engagement with, and analysis of, the "objet petit a" in the work of Zizek and Lacan.  Perhaps "race" in general ought to be regarded a primordial psychic "hole," an "absence" or pure negativity where a "grounding" for discourse ought to be but proves to be lacking.  Unfortunately that is a proposition that Eng hints at but does not explore.+books
Pops a Few European Balloons+P+This is a good critique of the assumptions made by Eurocentric historians over the years about the superiority of Europe as compared to the inferiority of the rest of the world.  Blaut effectively examines and explodes each theory dispassionately but thoroughly.  Finally he comes up with his own explanation for European success since 1492:  America.  Europe's &quot;discovery&quot; of and exploitation of North and South America gave it the wherewithall it needed to overtake and surpass the rest of the world.  A well written, well documented assessment which deserves a place beside The Great Divergence and ReOrient, among others+books

Scale Victorian house plans and detail drawings.+P+This book, originally published in 1881, contains floorplans and elevations of several dozen Victorian houses.

This book is a must-have for fans of Victorian architecture or home builders that are looking for Victorian-style idea+books
Live--gulp--For--gulp--Ever+P+A vitamin every six minutes ranks up there with Voltaire's 50 cups of coffee a day. Such monomania would seem frivolous were the stakes not so high. Ray is simply a Baby Boomer limping along better than most, until he catches the singularity train of (relative) immortality, which should be along real soon now.

Insightful and Practical+P+This is a great book. Dahut's analysis of the mindset of the lawyer as he goes about marketing and managing his practice is frighteningly accurate - the way we think as lawyers clearly restricts our ability to be good enterprise builders. Dahut's discussion on law firm branding and leadership building was right on the money. I would recommend this book highly to other lawyers - in fact, it should be required reading in law schools. Finally, while the book is a little on the pricey side, I got my money's worth and then some.  I give this book five stars. +books
Vitriolic, spiteful and disproven claims+N+I have not bought this book as I would not let one penney fall into Garrison's pocket, but I've perused this volume heavily.  I wish that I could have given it 0 stars.  The author is an unreconstructed Confederate  who, whenever there is a remotely possible sinister way of interpreting  Lincoln's actions, prefers to submit that view rather than acknowledge the  findings of recognized scholars' research.  For example, he claims that  Lincoln is responsible for the creation of the &quot;Imperial  Presidency&quot;, making possible the abuses of Nixon, Vietnam, etc.  But  he does not show that Lincoln's powers were often balanced by a war conduct  committee, that the Presidency went on to lose considerable authority and  esteem in the Reconstruction years, and that Lincoln himself acknowledged  that, except in the case of national emergencies, as the Civil War was  viewed, the President lacked powers to do many things (like the  Emancipation Proclamation).  Garrison also blames Lincoln for being  uncompromising and contends, without proof, that the Confederacy's desire  to continue as a separate nation would have faded, if allowed, resulting in  reunification.  But most scholars acknowledge that the individual states  would have sooner seceded even further into smaller nations, and that other  states in the Union would have found reason to secede into new  confederacies.  Thus, as I've said, Garrison's trash has been disproven yet  he pretends as though it has not even been noticed by scholars.  It is the  vitriolic spite of an unenlightened Confederate clinging to the bitterness  of ancestors.  This book should be relegated to the heap of trash-writing  never to be recovered+books
Diamond Age - the Movie+P+If what I hear is correct, George Clooney is making this marvellous book into a movie. Joy+books
The good soldier+N+I know that I will outrage alot of people with this review but here goes... This is one of only 2 books that I have ever read that I truly REGRET devoting the time to , but once I start a book I always finish.I don't know what else to say except that it was painful for me to finish this.  I just don't get it.  The main character was quite annoying to me and the story was SO SLOW and predictable I really just wanted it to end. I would not recommend this book for fun and if it is required reading for you I am sorry.  +books
Waste of Money+N+I bought this book based upon some of the other reviews that said it was great and they couldn't have been more wrong. I needed the book on short notice so it cost me $25 and it was absolutely useless. There is nothing useful in this book at all. I ended up just winging the toast because I didn't have time to look for another book+books
It's a long path+P+The book is written in a way that does explain the Japanese karate training experience very well.  I've done it for 35+ years and his book sums up a lot of things that take a long time to figure out.  I was trained by a former JKA kumite champion who came to the U.S. with little english and a goal of teaching karate as it was taught to him and figuring out what he wasn't taught. He is still a great teacher although he has not reached out for the commercial aspects of karate. The book goes a long way in helping students understand the JKA and what is the essence of the karate training. It will be interesting to see if the author can write another book in 10 more years about what else he has learned+books
Waste of time+N+I have read everyone of Ludlum's books and it is a disgrace that this book has his name attached to it. I struggled through the first hundred pages waiting for something well written and interesting. It never happened. I don't quit many books before they are finished, but I just couldn't stand this any more.+books
Method in that madness+P+This series of essays reanimates the real Feyerbend, too often associated with a series of much denounced one-liners, such as the 'anything goes' pronouncement. In fact, Feyerbend rides the dialectical red zone in hairpin turns near the unexplored terrain where science fans, groupies, Darwin fanatics, and the 'anally overtrained' fear to tread, lest their weltanschaung be seen as Romantic poets once saw it. As a science fan myself, I can only watch in wonder and some sadness the 'social construction', in the age of Big Science, of something more sophisticated than, but not altogether different from, what the Church Fathers concocted from thin air, thereby freezing the minds of the many for millennia. It can't happen again, but it can attempt to happen again. That's the nice thing about science, you will lose all your paradigms, sooner better than later+books
Very enjoyable book to read with your toddler!+P+Higly recommend to read with your toddler-absolutely wonderful illustrations! What a cute story!!!!+books
I dropped it after 21 pages+N+This book from what other reviewers said really doesn't add much new info in terms of the much-publicized deaths of TuPac, Biggie or Jam Master Jay ... which is one of the big motivations I'm sure most of us consider reading a book like this.  Also the fact that this book was written by a cop from the once secret "Hip Hop police" is also somewhat novel.  You'll spend most of the first 20 pages sifting through this guy trying to straddle the fence -- sounding official & professional to rep police but also trying to come off as empathetic and altruistic in his quest to "save" hip hop's elite from crime & corruption.  Read this book with a grain of salt!!!!  I dropped it after Page 21 (go to a bookstore or library and read the bottom 2.5 paragraphs).  Parker's basic premise in his defense of policing hip hop is NOT that he sees the stars as needing protection (which is why soooo many rappers still roll deep, packin' heat!), but rather that so many are still so heavily involved in criminal activity he's doing what he does for public safety.  Give me a break.  Who's really afraid of Ludacris? Jay-Z? Kanye West? Chamillionaire (or 50 Cent for that matter)?  Parker dares to use the term "public safety" in this defense and discusses how any number of acts of gunplay could "breakout at any time" when rappers are in public.  Let's see, we've got ...  A raging war in Iraq & the threat of nuclear terrorism.  Ongoing police brutality issues.  Trickle down damage from crooked politicians.  Real crime.  All kinds of sexual predators.  Increasingly fragile school systems not to mention poverty, intolerance & all kinds of social ills.  Yeah, Parker's doing a great job defending society from public enemy No. 1:  Poor black men who use hip hop success to rise to a better life.  Skim the book's latter chapters for the minor details you seek if you'd like, but I pass on reading more of this crap.  I'm sure he's got interesting stories to tell, but this book just reads like an opportunist looking to make a fast buck by preying on the weak-minded blind enough to believe rappers (code for young black men) must be tamed+books
glorious+P+A well wrought, beautifully written novel. Meant to be re-read several times+books
Great Discussion Group Book+P+A good read.  Hurston does an excellent job of depicting the parallel experiences of the captivity of the Israelites and the American Slave.  In fact, one could argue that the experience of the Israelites is the American  Slave experience. This is a great book for high school reading, it provides  a variety of cause and effect themes that all young adults need to know;  among them, if you oppress a people or person you breed fear, insecurity,  and eventual self hatred in that human. I highly recommend Their Eyes Were  Watching God another of Hurston's literary jewels. jewels+books
Fabulous illustrations...+P+My 4 year old son and I stumbled across this book in the library and I immediately knew we had to have our own copy.  The poem that constitutes the text of this book is simple and timeless.  The illustrations are breathtaking.  Each painting depicts the same train at the crossing, the various townspeople waiting at the crossing and the contents of the freight cars.  My son loves inventing 'conversations' between the people waiting for the train to pass.  A lovely book that is a nice addition to any child's library+books
Congratulations, all of you, on your fine, fine...+P+A toast!  Tenure all around.  Bravo, marvellous.  All of you--really.  Really, truly marvelous.  So many insights.  You've got Paris on the Iowa River out there, you really do.  A round table to make King Arthur proud.  A real Salon--Kantian style.  Brilliant, on every possible level.  So true, everything was so true; and so well-said, from start to finish.  Not a word out of place.  Ideal.  Perfection!  Stupendous!  I can't rave enough.  Tenure for everyone!  On me+books
A Memorable Story+P+I am now 20 years old and haven't read this book since Elementary school.  Today, I randomly found the book on Amazon and the familiar first edition hardcover. I don't know how old I was when I first read it, but I independently borrrowed it from the library at least 3 different times and enjoyed reading it every time.  I've always remembered, foremost, the cleverness of the Dolphins and the anxiety and relief I felt every time I read the scenes with the sharks or the baby being unhooked.  I would say Dolphin Adventure has made a positive and lasting impression upon me and that every animal-loving child should read it+books
Technically Accurate and Best of the Bunch+P+William as always is able to take difficult technical topics and make them easier to understand. I have been running Vista since beta one, and this book is an excellent reference for those of us already familiar with  Windows operating systems. He doesn't waste your time and jumps right in to explanations of the most significant changes in Vista and how these impact working with Vista. He divides the most complex topics into easy to understand sections and truly shows depth of understanding.  As an MCSE I have enjoyed reading William's books for many years. I started out with his first Pocket Consultant about 8-9 years ago and have been getting every one he writes since. My understanding always increases several fold while reading his books whether a completely new subject or something more familiar. He always helps you understand subjects better and his always clear and concise approach is refreshing.  You can't lose with Stanek's books. He knows how to zero in on what's important. He understands IT and writes from experience. This is an excellent book for those of us working in IT. My support and developer friends are always stealing my copy of this book+books
Teaching is his life - his whole life.+N+Ron Clark is another award-winning teacher who apparently doesn't have a life away from his students.  His 55 rules sometimes cross the line into "parent" territory, as when he teaches his children how they should answer the phone at home, and his "ABC's of Etiquette" is subdivided into 26 rules about table-mannners.  He also apparently takes students on field trips that he sometimes pays for out of his own pocket, a questionable practice in most districts.  Some of his suggestions, like assigning extra work as a punishment, are just wrong.  New teachers will perhaps be inspired by this book, but there is nothing here that any veteran teacher couldn't tell you.  Save your money+books
Just a waste+N+Hi, I purchased this book, and found out I had wasted my money (by my own fault, i will admit).  There is nothing in this book that is useful.  Dissappointing...+books
The best book on creativity ever written+P+I first read A Technique for Producing Ideas 20 years ago.  Webb explains simply, effectively, and with brevity how "creativity" happens in our minds.  You will develop "habits of the mind" that will stay with you for life.  Really.  Anyone can be creative and everyone should read this book.  It's not just for advertising people--anyone who creates (scientists, engineers, businesspeople, etc.) will become smarter and more creative+books

Let His Death Crown His Life!+P+I am in ethereal love with Mary Shelley. Why is her literary importance and fancy not uplifted more than it is? I grimace whenever I go to a bookstore and glance each time at the Mary Shelley section to find only Frakenstein. She has other great books probably not many people know about. Such is the case in The Last Man. I thought Frankenstein was about as sad as one could allow a character to feel but after reading The Last Man Mary out does herself by really putting poor Verney in a pickle. This story really tugged at me hard and actually made me feel for the characters in a way so few books or movies ever have. If you know about Mary Shelley and have read Frankenstein or anything else by this, I feel, greatest author to have ever put word to paper, then you MUST read this beautiful accounting of "the last year of the world". It astonished me to find out that the book was out of print from 1833 to 1965. Wow! I failed to compare the story to such contemporary biological warfare or AIDS for that matter and took the story's meaning for what Shelley may have wanted to get across during her time that had neither. I believe she wants to almost persuade us of a deeper level of human condition and compassion by taking us as low as we can and then allowing us to constantly strive upward from that awful place she leaves Verney. Please, read more of Mary Shelley+books
Play Rhymes+P+The illustrations are beautiful.  The pictograms give parents great ideas  to improvise, and create new movements. My 11 month-old baby enjoys the  rhymes, even though she is not yet old enough to follow my moves as I sing  or recite them, she tries to imitate me.   We have a great time together  and you can always get a smile from her when we sing &quot;Wheels on the  bus&quot;  or &quot;I'm a little teapot.&quot;   Fantastic book!!+books
Marshmallow today, gone tomorrow?  This book changed my old habits and tomorrow I'll have two marshmallows!+P+My aunt recently came to visit me and strongly suggested I read your "Don't eat the marshmallow...yet!" book along with the Motivational mini book.  Since reading the book (just two days ago), one effect your book had on me was to set up a savings account that will transfer funds from my checking account twice a month.  My aunt, along with your book, also inspired me use passages and quote some lines that I am using for my midterm paper.    I wanted to thank you for the inspiration and additional motivation (that I YES needed!).  I am continuing the domino effect and am recommending this book to my friends and even my boss.  I will continue re-reading this book and adopt the marshmallow theory/delayed gratification as my own.  I strongly believe this has provided a positive change in my life that I will repeatedly profit from+books
It must be a guy thing+N+I found the plot of this book impossible to follow.  It contains excessively verbose descriptions with a lot of cliches. The hero almost dies twice in a row and is each time magically saved for no reason.  And there are only so many times I can read variations of "he swung his sword really hard" and "it was a really scary dragon."  The illustrations are quite beatiful, though+books
A Rhetorical Bore+N+Ugh.  This is an example of how academia has invaded and pillaged modern music writing.  This woeful treatise on Dai Griffiths's random thoughts on pop music and the question of "classic status" uses Radiohead's OK Computer as an unfortunate jumping off point.  Most of the book is devoted to the study of pop music, the lexicon of recording conventions, and a labored breakdown of songs, not by sensible musical breaks, but awkwardly by minutes and seconds.  Reading this book is about as much fun as parsing a calculus equation.  Indeed it reminded me of why I am so glad to be out of school.  It's intellectual masturbation (or wanking, I suppose) of the worst kind.    A choice quote:  "...OK Computer might in time be a focal point for historians of life at the close of the twentieth century.  'This is what was really going on.'  You want to know what 1997 felt like?  OK Computer: tracks six - eight.  Pushed for time? - track seven."  Track seven of course is "Fitter Happier."  Yep.  That song sums up the end of the 20th century, according to Griffiths, and naturally, this record.  Point of fact, more time is spent discussing "Fitter Happier" in this book than for any other song on the album, a very strong indication of worthless dissection by a rhetorical bore.    Another great quote: "Thom Yorke is less a songwriter to my mind than a peculiar thing, an 'idea-led word-producer,' the words important as things in themselves rather than necessarily for their place in the song."  That from the section in the book, "Words."  And from the section, "Those pesky sound-effect openings and endings":  "I'm not sure about those bits, though they certainly pad out the time."    In other words, the sound design of each song's opening, ending, and/or transitions exist merely to support the author's argument that CD albums are typically longer than albums recorded for vinyl release.  Yes, those sonic orchestrations: time killers.  OK Computer is a remarkable album because of its ground breaking and remarkable music and lyrics.  This is a solid basis for a book of this kind.  Instead, this book is built upon the argument:  OK Computer is an album made up of sound effects, music with key and tempo changes, words about animals, death, moods, and electronics, and is remarkable only in that it was recorded for a CD, not a vinyl LP.  In fact, in time it will probably be remembered for being not very remarkable at all.  A note to the editors of 33 1/3: Next time hire a writer who actually enjoys the album he/she is writing about+books
Pretentious and Badly Written+N+I cringed while reading this book and actually flung it across a waiting area at a gate in Heathrow Airport in disgust upon finishing it.  (No one was in the way and I did retrieve it - to throw it out properly in a trashcan.)  Mr. Rushdie is obviously a brilliant man but he is out of his element writing about rock and roll.  I felt embarrassed for him while reading this and I really did want to love it.  The language is forced and pretentious; it sounds like it was written by a corporate CEO desperately trying to be cool.+books
A leader in implant dentistry---an excellent text for novice and experienced alike+P+Michael Block is an extraordinary educator and this text demonstrates his teaching abilities and his knowledge of implant dentistry. He sits on the education committees of several scientific academies for a reason. There is content appropriate for all dentists, not just Oral Surgeons. The text is easy to navigate through, there are ample references that will be helpful to students and educators alike, and the images, etc. are helpful towards clarifying concepts in implant dentistry. It is a must for every advanced implant surgeon and cutting edge restorative clinician+books
Soul and Psyche+P+Anyone who has worked in the area where psychology and religion interface will appreciate this solid, thorough and carefully edited work that is without par in the field. Grounded in the actual experience of the "theology of living documents", the articles are as much practical as theoretical and adcademic.  Thoroughly ecumenical, this massive reference work promotes dialogue between faith and theology and clinical theory and practice. If this is the kind of subject that interests you then you need to own this book.   F.X. Charet Phd+books
An excellent overview of an exceptional martial artist+P+This book is an excellent general biography of a great martial artist.

The book  is a fine tribute to a humble, talented person and instructor+books
a poetic, important, and terrible book+N+MacKinnon writes with smoothe, poetic prose, that disguises her petulant and arrogantly low estimation of the average women.  The logical flaws only start there.  The book is deeply myopic in its interpretation of history,  just as Marx's work (MacKinnon's ideal) was.  I recommend it only because  of the woefully influential effect it is having on the U.S. judicial system  - know thine enemy+books
How about a little heads up...+N+that this is such a religious book. I want my money back..+books
Interesting read, but I'm still not convinced.+N+My mother-in-law presented me with this book in a poor attempt to convert me into Christianity.   I tried to read the book as thoroughly as possible. It was difficult to keep interested in the first half of the book. In my personal opinion, the author seems to ramble on about the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin on many occasions, this seems to be his only method of proving that the "Bible Code" does in fact, exist.   Not to mention his constant reminding that he 'does not believe in God or prophecies.' This gets very tiring. Drosnin does not provide solid evidence, no matter how he tries to dress it up with scientific terms. The author kills his credibility on repeated occasions.   Overall, I found this to be an interesting read, but the author's arguements were not convincing enough for me.+books
A fine volume gathering a diverse range of tales+P+400 years of Afro-American folklore are represented in From My People, a fine volume gathering a diverse range of tales, from Brer Rabbit and African motifs to proverbs, recipes, and folk songs. It's the range of writings which sets From My People apart from competing collections on Afro-American oral traditions, making for a comprehensive and important title+books
Politics Fernand Braudel style social history.+P+This book is how popular history should be written. It not only covers the famous figures but does some in-depth history of everyday life. Incidentally, a type of history pioneered, and done best, by French historian Fernand Braudel. Another reviewer sites Zinn as if it is his original style. His works are bad American copies of the work of the French Annales school of historical study+books
Done With Dean+N+I have listened to a bunch of Dean Koontz books. While listening to the second one I saw so many similarities, which really turned me off. And this flaw continued which each book I listen to, which caused me to be reluctant to buy this book. However, most of the stories were pretty good so I stuck with him.  This is not the case with this book.  "Cold Fire" is absolutely horrible.  I so regret purchasing this book.  It is so bad that I have decided to swear off Dean for looooooooong while.  Just on a side note, "The Bad Place" is the first DK book I read and it was very entertaining.+books
loved it+P+i bought the book after reading a shorter tolstoy story, years ago. at first i was intimidated by the length of this story and couldnt get into it to start. finally, i picked it up again and was dissapointed i waited so long, it definitely doesnt seem as long once you get going. its an amazing book and has become one of my favorite+books
Does Anne also suffer from the curse?+N+As an avid fan and owner of every book she's published I was VERY disappointed in the storyline, plot, sub-plot, character development (actually lack there of), dialog, I can go on.  When the story moves into dream sequences it's disjointed, choppy and is like flipping channels and watching a movie that has been on for over an hour.  I haven't finished the book, I have no desire, inclination or motivation to.  I stopped reading the book a week ago and haven't felt the urge to pick it up again. I am barely 1/2 way through the book.  I feel like I wasted money.  I feel robbed+books
Life and Death in a Virginia Colony+P+I first read Martin's Hundred when I was in the  hospital waiting to give birth to my first child. I managed to stay interested between my labor pains, and that says a lot about Mr. Hulme's  writing! I've re-read it four times since. The archaeological details and interpretations are utterly fascinating, especially those of the pointed-roof coffins and poor &quot;Granny's hairdo.&quot;  The colonists who inhabited the Carter's Grove site really came alive for me.  This is an all- time favorite book of mine+books
Magnum Opus of Election in laymen's terms+P+I'd say my title pretty much sums it up. This is one of the simplest treatments of the doctrine of election for almost anyone to grasp. Dr. Sproul is magnificently insightful and methodical in the presentation of this glorious doctrine of Election+books
The rotten fruits of postmodernism+P+This book examines the Zeitgeist or spirit of the age, points out what is wrong with it and how to reverse the destructive trend. The modern era is taken as the period 1789 - 1989 and the Post-modern as the one that followed. The West is currently in the grip of the PoMo mindset, more so in Europe than in the USA.   Whereas reason was held as the highest value under modernism, it has been ridiculed by postmodernism where truth is considered to be extinct. Purpose and design were emphasized in modernism, but postmodernism emphasizes chance and randomness. The post-modern spirit considers values as relative and celebrates unreason and the loss of meaning. Deconstruction and contradiction are its gods.   Although the modern pursuit was inhospitable towards spiritual truth, debate was still possible because information was subject to induction and deduction. In the post-modern mentality the purpose of debate or dialogue is not to discover truth, since here facts have no legitimacy. Debate is therefore impossible.  The first section of the book is titled The Moods Of The Present; it explores the ideas and circumstances that gave birth to the current cultural struggle. The author rigorously investigates the PoMo mindset in the light of the fruits it has borne. This part contains interesting references to sources as varied as The Great Divorce and The Pilgrim's Regress by CS Lewis, the thoughts of GK Chesterton and even song lyrics by The Moody Blues (Question) and Carly Simon (Playing Possum).  The second section looks at voices from the past, those that have shaped Western culture down the ages. As postmodernism mocks the promise once offered by modernity, religion comes under even greater assault, partly because of the faults of politicised religion. Theocracy is not the answer. The real hope lies in a change of heart in the individual.   This section includes the poem Ozymandias by Percy Bysshe Shelley and an interesting quote by Peggy Noonan, among others. The author discusses the history of Manasseh, son of Hezekiah. Manasseh turned out to be one of the most evil kings in the history of ancient Judah. He was a practitioner of "multiculturalism,' introducing hideous habits like infanticide from the surrounding nations.   Zacharias provides a frightening description of what these sacrifices of children to Moloch must have been like. It shows how one person can lead millions into evil, when a nation ceases to think clearly. After Manasseh, the righteous King Josiah led the kingdom of Judah back to God again.  Section 3 explores the mystery of evil, with reference to the trial of Eichmann and popular culture like the movie Pulp Fiction in which murder is trivialized. The beautiful poem The Coming by R S Thomas is reproduced here, and the grace of God and the invitation to redemption are discussed.  Appendix A: The Ineradicable Word is a defence of the uniqueness and authority of the Bible, a brilliant apologetics for the veracity of the message in our Judeo-Christian scriptures. It deals inter alia with the transcultural nature of truth and the transformation of the soul.  Appendix B: Inextinguishable Light, deals with the structure of reason, certainty and the matter of absolutes. It includes a quote from Malcolm Muggeridge warning of the spiritual plague of relativism. It explains the relationship of logic - reason - truth and the Word as truth in the battleground of the heart.  The book concludes with an Annotated Bibliography of the Bible, Notes by chapter and a Study Guide with questions to use as a workbook. I also recommend Sinisterism by Bruce Walker, While Europe Slept by Bruce Bawer, Menace in Europe by Claire Berlinski, The Dragons Of Expectation by Robert Conquest, The Force Of Reason by Oriana Fallaci, The West's Last Chance by Tony Blankley and Our Culture: What's Left Of It by Theodore Dalrymple.+books
Review for those who haven't read Mitchell+P+I originially bought this book because I am a fan of McSorley's and wanted to learn a little about New York History.  I had no previous knowledge of Joseph Mitchell's works, and did not know what to expect.  I wondered how someone could write a 350 page book about when bar.  Then i soon realized that the book is a compilation of short stories about the characters of the city in the 30's and 40's.  Primary source history usually bores me, because it is often dry, about someone consequential, and you have to read through alot for a little interesting information. But the way Mitchell presents these characters you are drawn in into their plight,eccentricities, or just regular routines. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the history of the city, or if you are a fan of the bar and are just curious like mysel+books

Its the ECONOMICS, stupid !!+N+-Everyone expressing a erudite opinion about Clausewitz or "ON WAR" has completely missed the point here.  -The question is NOT whether Clausewitz or "On War" is an essential read for everyone interested in military hsitory or military affairs. THAT is a moot piont to the Nth Degree.  -The REAL question IS - WHY would you pay $595.oo for a book that has the same identical information as another book for $30.oo ?!?!?!?   -That is the ONLY question regarding THIS particular version of "ON WAR".  -Its the ECONOMICS, stupid !+books
A Must for Therapists+P+This is an excellent study of what goes on in the mind of the suicidal client.  It is also a beautiful and unforgettable book.  I found it touching and illuminating and it has had a profound impact on the way I treat such clients in therapy. I only thought I understood their psychological pain, but I am more accepting and empathic since reading this incredibly moving book.  Required reading for all therapists+books
Got the wrong book+N+Actually I intended to order another book "Ramp Plans: Learn How to Build Vert Street Mini Launch and Bowls (2000 Edition)", but by mistake seem to have ordered this one instead without realising it before it arrived.  Must be my mistake where as I should have noticed this in the confirmation email I got. Still, better luck next time..+books
Out of her element+N+The author is obviously as out of her element as Inspector Monk, and clearly has little knowledge of the ships, seafaring, nautical quarantine requirements, etc. of the 1860's.  Her characters are hardly believable:  Sutton, the rat exterminator and Dr. Crow are perhaps the worst examples, but not the only ones.  Would a proper young lady be picked up in a cab without a chaperon to go to a function?  Very disappointing+books
Not One of Valerie's Best+N+This book in my opinion left a lot to be desired.  Tamara usually has more on the ball than she did in this book.  I know she's no superwoman, but really her deductive reasoning was way off base here.  And, does Basil DuPre have to show up all the time.  I'm honestly a little tired of him+books
Disappointing+N+While I don't believe a writer has to follow in his/her own footsteps and write the same type of books over and over, this departure by Adriana Trigiani is not successful.   While it has the obligatory trip to Italy, it makes little or nothing of the trip and since a decorator is making the trip, I would have thought that she would have included a wealth of description here.  Instead the trip is glossed over and we are treated to only those descriptions of ottomans and fabric that adorn the homes of di Crespi's New Jersey clients. The book is filled with caricatures and not characters and no New Jersey Italian stereotype is left unturned. Not much of a story and the main character is rather boring as well.   If you insist on reading it, save your money and go to the library+books
Shades of Gray+P+This was an interesting and fun book.  The good guys are a little bad and the bad guys are a little good, although there ARE some really bad ones.  Reminiscient of the Nightside books by Simon Green, but still totally different.  Inspector Chen is a good guy who does the best he can, and still can't keep from getting involved with demons.  Holds your interest from the first, and keeps you turning those pages.  I liked the short chapters, and the overall format of the book.  The artwork on the cover is gorgeous.  I'm definitely reading the rest of this series.  This was the first Liz Williams book I have read, and I plan to look into her others+books
We're not as objective as we think we are+P+Thirty years ago Dr. Kassirer was my chief when I was a medical house officer in Boston. (That will serve as my disclosure of possible conflict of interest although we have had little contact since that time.) He has been a wildly successful nephorlogist/researcher, clinician and teacher. As editor of the New England Journal of Medicine, he constantly expressed concerns over possible conflict of interest and its influence on published medical literature. This book is a highly researched and extensively documented look at conflicts of interest and potential conflicts of interest in the medical literature and other closely related areas of medicine. Sometimes there are situations where potential conflict of interest has little or no influence on our decision making. As amply documented in On the Take, there are other times when conflict of interest may impact our decision making to the detriment of our patients. This book examines when and how the harmless potential conflict of interest moves into the realm of a serious, even ethical, dilemma. Amazingly, these conflicts may extend beyond the published medical literature to consensus papers and clinical guidelines increasingly embraced by the government and major medical societies and these conflicts of interest  may even intrude into organizations designed to protect the consumer like the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) and the CDC (Center for Disease Control). We as physicians minimize the extent to which potential conflicts of interest influence us in our medical practice - a view not widely shared by patients or government regulatory committees.  Dr. Kassirer presents a number of suggestions to improve the situation. Some of these are already being implemented by major medical journals. Others will depend on the integrity of individual practitioners. This book should be a must-read for medical students - both those planning to do medical research and those who will use the medical research to guide their medical practices. Martin G. Kistin, M.D+books
What does the turkey have to do with this mystery?+N+I was disappointed in this book.  I had started getting these books on CD from the library amd thoroughly enjoyed the first few I listened to.  I enjoy the author's picturesque, almost poetic, descriptions of things.  Those descriptions were still there, but they did not connect well.  The mystery of the person murdered becomes an incidental by-line, not really crucial to the other goings-on in the story.  There is no expanation to why the return of the turkeys is of any significance and what do the cats' being able to communicate with them have to do with anything in the story line.  I felt very let down at the end of this audio book+books
How builds happen in Microsoft land+P+Vincent works for Microsoft and has consequently had unique access their development organization. This books reflects this fact with frequent stories and asides - and for which alone its purchase is recommended. There is some good advice and tips in here, however I don't particularly like the latter chapters as they merely descend into an advert for the build capabilities in the (at the time forthcoming) Microsoft Team System+books
The School and Community Relations+P+My order came right on time!  Just like it said that it would.  The book was in excellent condition.  It was neatly wrapped and packed for safety.  I will shop here again in the near future.  J. Smith  Cedar Hill, Texa+books
boring...not even a suspenseful finale+N+I thought this book was incredibly slow. It never once peaked, nor did I find it all that engaging. Normally there is usually some big finale, or event that grabs you - not here.  The premise of the novel was pretty lame, and the "bad guys" were not exactly hard to figure out right away. All in all very disappointing+books
Too postmodern, disconnected from biblical truths+N+I received my first edition Ordering Your Private World (OPW) in 1985, as an undergraduate. I didn't really like the touchy-feely style of presentation, without any corroborrating references, for example, to the author's science of sleep minimization nor a biblically developed case for journaling. I remain puzzled on many points in the book. Contrary to the author's position, the psalmist tells us that &quot;God grants sleep to those He loves&quot;. While journaling can be a productive discipline, could it also lead to indulgent self-absorption? And if the journal is a private work, why would it be a treasure to posterity?     As I realize that the author's life could be construed as fairly disordered, at least from several direct observations I've had of him failing to keep his commitments (from the time of his original OPW to the time of this new edition), I feel less discomfort in providing a less than enthusiastic review. During my recent move to a new home, I decided to discard a box of &quot;low-utility&quot; books. Without reticence, I included my old copy of OPW in the junk box. How ironic, perhaps even Spirit guided, my consternation when the current OPW was required reading for an upcoming leadership course, and I had to further donate to the author's estate given how I remembered the first edition. Perhaps that cost could be redeemed by this feedback.    A basic issue for many christians is living the &quot;driven vs. called&quot; life. I believe that the book will be more convicting to those who are driven, because they may experience some empathy with and conviction from the author, who himself is an admitted driven personality. For such a reader, I can only conclude that replacing the drivenness to succeed with a pursuit of God's calling can only expand His creative purpose and kingdom.    I believe that the author is a fellow believer of Jesus Christ, and has been redeemed by God for His purpose. I suspect that I am as much as a sinner as he is, but I'm not the one peddling orderly life advice. Now that I have now read the latest edition, I am still recommending that this probably is not worth your time or money+books
A Classic in its Time+P+In reading Heart Sense by Dr. Paula Reeves,I have found this book to be a vast and deep sounce of the most practical and applicable knowledge and wisdom for changing your life from a fate-oriented, sad and unfulfilled life to one of living consciously into your own personal destiny .Dr. Reeves has given us a truly brilliant blueprint intergrating the current scientific and medical research with the intuitive wisdom of the body mind heart. For me, this is the jewel in an immense array of &quot;self-help&quot; books out there. It is so much more that it falls beyond that catagory. Thank you, Dr. Reeves, for this profound work+books
A great look back....+P+A great look back at many interesting and important time periods of Ringo and the Beatles, happy times, turnoil, post Beatles, pesonal up's and down's.  Obviously the 4 of them tried to keep contact during the post Beatles years and Ringo was nice enough to keep all the postcards and publish them for the fans to read+books
Not For Me - but pretty+N+Very Pretty but a limited number of arms and my family was not even in the book.  For such an expensive work, I expected my family to be there+books
???????????????!+P+What th???? thoughts, fearful examination of the insanity and ecstacy of self-refective perception. disjointed. razors, withered weathered fields of obsessive compulsio+books
The book of quotes+N+Imagine writing a book by simply stringing quotes and references together with your literary contribution limited to connecting verbs and you have this book in a nutshell!  Maybe I would have liked it if the author had titled it, Frontsoldaten: The book of quotes+books
Good ideas....+P+The cookbook does the best it can considering the subject!  What foodie wants to give up food?  Not that one is giving up food per se.  Maybe trying one recipe per week and gradually replacing high fat foods instead of going it cold turkey would work.  There's nothing wrong with the recipes I've tried.  I'd just rather be eating foods I need to let go of+books
Great Book!+P+I just finished reading the Wizard of Ads, and was completely impressed with it on every level. My husband read it first and almost insisted that I read it as well. I'm glad I did. It was very informative and easy to read as well. Before reading this book, I was looking at the online reviews and noticed the one titled "Too Religious, Too Partisan, Yuck!" or something like that. After reading this book and learning a little bit about Roy Williams, I feel compelled to respond to his comments.   This book is in no way religious, and contains absolutely no political content whatsoever. The person who wrote that review apparently found out that Roy Williams once had lunch with a conservative Governor, and that he might be a Christian. He thought that reason enough to call Williams "creepy" and blast a book which it seems he never even read. Then in the middle of his review, this guy starts raling against the Bush administration and how he's responsible for boring TV ads during the Super Bowl. What??? This is obviously a bitter person who is just looking for reasons to slam people that might hold views different from his own. But in this case, the criticism couldn't be more unwarranted.  Roy Williams has personally trained executives from companies such as Proctor and Gamble, USA Today, and many others. The Wizard of Ads was named Business Book of the Year, and hit #1 on both the Wall Street Journal and New York Times business best seller list. You will find absolutely no political or religious activism of any kind in this book. What you will find is extremely valuable advice that, if applied, will make your business more profitable.  +books
Improvement over the first edition+P+The third edition contains material about high gain observers and sliding modes which are  welcome additions. The book also contains sections about backstepping and passivity techniques. As in the first edition the author's writing is clear and concise. It is a good complement to Vidyasagar's Nonlinear Systems book.+books
Audio quality is very poor+N+The quality of the recording on the Audio Series is very poor. It distracted from the message. I was expecting this to be a audio version of portions of the book, but instead they are poor recordings of his sermons. Tape 2 of 3 was a recording of someone besides Tommy Tenney+books
Disappointing Book+N+Now that I have a son, I have noticed that he is much different than my daughters.  I was one of those people who thought boys and girls are not much different, it's all about environment.  I was very wrong!  That discovery is what led me to buy this book.  I want to understand my son better.  It started out with some interesting thoughts about how school is not set up for boys, but for girls and that boys are "hard wired " to be as they are, but it definitely had a hostile tone toward women.  I do not consider myself a feminist, but I was offended at the author's view of females.  He is a "masculinist".  He offers sympathy to the 18 year old patient who impregnates a girl and then is angry that she won't have an abortion.  Why should he be involved with a child he doesn't want?  He says men don't pay their child support because the mothers make them angry and they are justified in that.  His views on male sexuality are depressing.  Men just want sex and there is nothing we can do about that.  I would not want this guy in my son's life.  MOST IMPORTANTLY, I consider advice on how to raise a boy dubious at best coming from someone who has never lived with a boy.  The authors has only daughters! I truly don't know how this guy got famous.  I could only see him fanning the flames of women haters+books
Top Notch Whodunit+P+P.D. James, aka Phyllis Dorothy James White, has painted the mystery genre with a literary hue which has delighted fans for decades. Her writing is stylish and extremely well-crafted. Her characters are so fully developed that they seem almost like friends the reader delights in meeting again.  James' heroine in this book, Cordelia Grey, lacks the long and rich legacy of Adam Dalgliesh - the author's usual sharp-witted and charming P.I., but she does pack a wallop in the two books she appears in.   Mature and wise beyond her years - Cordelia is only 22 when we meet her - this heroine knows how to draw us into the murder at hand - in this case the neglected but privileged son of a powerful scientist. Brave and insightful sometimes, scared and confused often, Cordelia soldiers through this mystery from one deduced fact to the next and arrives at a somewhat unusual (for this genre) denoument. I won't tell you what that is but it causes a bemused Adam Dalgliesh to pop up at the end of the book in a half-hearted attempt to break down Cordelia's defenses.   Cordelia is an appealing and well-drawn character who only appeared in two of James' novels. She later, mistakenly she says, sold Cordelia, or the rights to her existence anyway, to the BBC, which subsequently did a TV series based on the character.   I picked up this book as a dog-eared paperback in a used book store because the title kept popping up in lists of "bests" for this genre - most recently in an essay by Anna Quindlan. I haven't read a mystery in years but found myself really enjoying this one - for the story, the lovable Cordelia, and for the craftsmanship of the author. Recommended+books
Activities Galore!+P+This is an excellent book for emergent level readers. I really liked the MANY quarter fold books which focus on both letter/sound recognition and high frequency words. I have used these activities in small group, as independent practice, as homework and in my literacy centers. Also included are manuscript printing practice pages that work well as homework due to the detailed letter formation instructions on each page, class books, poetry, and letter cards. What a valuable resource - Thank You+books
A Waste of Time+N+Dull and inane come to mind. Consists mostly of Peabody's artificially "catty" - sometimes racist - first-person remarks about everyone she meets (even the cat), fuzzy descriptions of Egyptian "archaeology" (...). The plot is slow moving, cliché and peopled with characters that come across as cardboard cutouts. I found more of pennance than pleasure in this read. Avoid it+books
Enuff Already!!! End the Agony & GET ON With It!+N+This once promising and enjoyable series (and I have read every book) has just become too much like an overblown TV soap opera. Every time one problem or mystery seems to be cleared up, it either evolves into something else or another situation takes it's place and we have to wait a year or more for the next episode. Temple appears to have finally made a choice between the two M's but we all know that's only a deception. The one bright spot in the story (and earlier books had a whole lot more of them) is on page 297 and involves the wonderful Fontana Brothers doing a James Bond imitation. It took me forever to read this book and made me think it would be my last Midnight Louie story until the end. And I must say it's a shocker and I will have to read the next installment but get a headache thinking things will drag out til the author reaches "Z"+books
great gift, reference, and coffee table book+P+The original edition of this book was out of print for some years and it is delightful to see it out again, and expanded no less. It combines 2 great virtues: highly readable and informative text with illustrations of a quality that are &quot;suitable for framing.&quot; It is a great book for anyone who takes an interest in botany, cooking, or gardening and you couldn't go wrong giving it as a gift to one of these types. It's also great for reference. If you're getting it as a gift I suggest ordering 2, because you'll want one for yourself when you see it+books
This Is Not Leather Bound !+N+Great book, but Amazon have made a serious mistake in the description.  They say it is "Leather Bound".   It is most definitely NOT leather bound.  It is leatherette, which is not leather.  Leatherette is fake leather made from some kind of plastic.  Don't be fooled.  IT IS NOT LEATHER BOUND.  I bought one and was very disappointed.  I told Amazon, but they didn't want to know and I see they are still advertising it as leather when it is not+books
the textbook on Bosch fuel injection+P+Written as a textbook and how-to.   Good illustrations.  Best when used with the Bosch factory manua+books
Perverted+N+I'm sorry I wasted the money. I can see by the reviews you either love it or hate it.  I'm not squeamish by nature, but this book is one continuous torture fest which not only targets human victims, but animals as well.  Three quarter's way through, when I realized this indeed was the premise from beginning to end, I started skipping these parts (which got me to the last page quite quickly). I was bored and disgusted with the author.  I believe he had a sick fetish and lived them out through these pages. In the end my eyeballs got six-pack abs from rollng around so much.  This book is going on my "Do Not Lend" shelf as I value my friends and wouldn't consider them subjecting them to such gory nonsense. +books
JJ+N+The numerous vague flow charts, weak graphics, and conflicting statements did little to promote the learning process.  Cites many dated studies and implies causation with little statistical relevance.  Similarly, the author's exam questions led to more frustration as many appear to be developed to trick the reader+books
newer is not better+N+The newer editions of the Delorme Atlases are much inferior to, and skimpier on data, than their older editions. I assume they did this to save on printing costs. The maps contain only about half of the data that the older additions had. For example,in the new editions there are elevations listed for only the highest peaks, few of which are even named, and there is no data about mines or springs or many of the other features that the old editions included. Other than the newly added GPS coordiante data, they are just glorified road maps, which you can get at the gas station. I own several of these from many years back, but am very disappointed in the new editions+books
hmm I'd Say Robertson Is The New World Order+N+The arrogant way in which many evangelicals behave has me  believing they themselves are the New World Order.Here's my  point,if a religion wants to make all other religions obsolete, have controll of the economy and middle east,advance their  cause in a materialistic manner and rule the earth,this is  truly The New World Order.The obvious hatred of anything but  western religion and philosophy could have a frightening outcome.One of my dearest friends lives in Colorado Springs.Her family goes way back and they are very resentful of the many new comers whom have made their town a haven for born agains. You can't walk down the street without the feeling that some  evangelical will walk up to you and start preaching.This is just a start for them I'd assume.Their goal stretches over the  earth,to conquer and controll.Politics and religion are tied into one another and this is very common with born agains.In a  sense he is writing about himself and his chrones.Can't help but think they need to look in the mirror to see who the real  anti christ is.Jesus never condoned this arrogance+books
Overpriced. Terrible layout.+N+This is a really thin book, and for the price, the production value is terrible. The graphic design, and poor layout, takes a lot away from the information of the book. Page after page, you wonder if this recent publication was from the 1980s.  The information was light, and just skimmed over details. There was WAY too much emphasis on Analog. There are other search softwares out there. The case studies were nice, but no real insight was given.  Overall - it's an overpriced fluff book. Could be summaried in 5 pages+books
Too Much Politics, Not Enough Biography+N+I like Grant Green. I always thought he was one of the four or five top jazz guitarists of his day. He deserves a true biography, rather than the immaturish writing and same old liberal rationalisms for why Mr. Green failed and died young. His career failed and he died young becauee of drugs---no one's fault but his own.+books
Buy a Grant Green CD instead!+N+Being a big fan of Grant's unique guitar playing, I've always wanted to know a bit more about the man behind the music.  As far as I know, this is the only book about him.  The book doesn't go into a great amount of  detail.  The discography and selected reviews are worth reading.  I'd say  your best bet to understanding Grant Green would be to spend the money you  would plunk down on this book on a good CD of his- Idle Moments, Green  Street, The Complete Quartets with Sonny Clark. Then you can really get  your money's worth..+books
hemlock bay+P+I have really enjoyed the the FBI thrillers.  Dillon Savich and Sherlock have been through a lot together and it keeps getting better+books
Thought provoking tips for becoming a great salesperson+P+Reviewed by Stephanie Rollins for Reader Views (2/07)     Steve Chandler has written many motivational books, such as "35 Ways to Create Great Relationships" and "100 Ways to Motivate Yourself."  "The Joy of Selling" is another great book by Chandler.  In "The Joy of Selling," Chandler has 51 shorts chapters that include practical, easy tips for maximizing the reader's potential in sales.  There are 132 pages in "The Joy of Selling."  It is easy to read.  The font is large.  It is divided into small chapters.  These small chapters remind me of the format used for desk calendars.  It is efficiently and effectively written.  One of my favorite points is that contrary to popular belief, daydreaming is a waste of time.  In response to a question about the importance of women daydreaming about their goals, he replies "I think daydreaming is infantile, and I think it is demeaning to women how many motivational speakers try to manipulate women's natural creativity by encouraging dreaming and daydreaming and wishing and hoping."  He explains his point, "Stop fooling around with daydreams and wishes and spinning around the bedpost singing his name like a bad Julie Andrews movie...this is an insulting recommendation to women who would like to really achieve something."  He speaks often of turning our weaknesses into a positive part of our sales persona.  Do not hide the fact that you are a normal human with normal human demands and stresses.  He explains how he advised a former waitress to use her experience as a waitress to improve her sales potential.  She did not want to be the typical pushy salesperson, and she felt like less of a salesperson for that feeling.  He explained that she did "sell" when she was a waitress.  She let them try to make their decisions.  She occasionally gave recommendations.  He explains, "When you find your talent for selling, it will become a Socratic drawing out of the talent that is already there..."  So if you are a mother and a salesperson, why hide that like it is a dirty secret?  Chances are that the person you are trying to sell to is a parent.  If you are way more casual than most salespeople, why feel guilty about it?  Maybe you will put your clients at ease with your lack of pretentiousness.  Do I sound like I can relate to this?  I can.  I turned being a casual mother of four into a great asset, and I now have a large client base of casual, family-oriented people.  Steve Chandler's "The Joy of Selling" is a book of great tips.  Read it a little at a time.  Reading a chapter a day is great.  Then you can dwell on the points in that chapter throughout the day.  Decide how you can use them.  This well-written book can be quite an asset in your career in sales+books
Through the Eyes of a Civil War Orphan..+P+Emily Pigbush is an orphan. In the first few chapters of the book, she loses her mother, and her father is long gone from the war.She is left to live with her best friend Annie, the daughter of Mary Surratt.That night, there is a great outcry in the city of Washington, where Emily lives. Mr. Lincoln, the president, has been shot dead. Emily is even more stunned when she hears who had done it-- the man who had been staying with the Surratt's, John Wilkes Booth. The Surratts are thrust into investigation for connection to the murder. Emily is sent to stay with her rich uncle instead, Valentine. She gets along well there, until she uncovers a sinister secret from a woman staying in the house -- her uncle could be a bodysnatcher. She pursues the idea, quietly, until she is confronted at school by a reporter's daughter. Her fears are confirmed when she sees the proof with her own eyes. She loses herself in her own emotions; love for Robert, a man Valentine saved, hate for all of them.  A very good illustration of the Civil War and the unjustly accused.+books
and now for something completely different+P+I bought this book with low expectation for both the poetry and the story. I'm happy to say that I was wrong. Emperor's Babe is sexy, stylish and just the most original book I've read in ages. The heroine is a tough little customer, a hip Afro Roman living in Londinium who meets the man of her dreams and loses everything else. By the time you come to last page I promise that you will be moved by her story+books
Toward a comprehensive classification of human organizations+P+Based on property right arrangements, Henry Hansmann proposed in his 1996 book an organizational classification covering most of organizations under the system of private property.  With the postulate of cost minimization,  he demonstrates convincingly how various kinds of organizations can be  placed into the analytical framework of economics.  In my opinion, this  organizational theory needs only some slight extension to become a  comprehensive one that includes all organizations under the private  property system.  With this extended viewpoint, all seemingly complicated  issues of organizations can be placed into a unified and systematic  framework of analysis.  This is the power and beauty of his organizational  theory.  My opinion is that Henry Hansmann has made path-breaking  contribution in the study of this filed, following R. Coase, A. Alchian,  and S. Cheung+books
A Conrad reader's favorite+P+Joseph Conrad is my favorite author, and I'm close to having read everything he's written.  This is my favorite novel.  I've read the criticism, that it's too sentimental, that its characters aren't as rich as in other Conrad tales...bumpkis.  Consider Schomberg, consider Heyst...well, unless you've read the novel of course you can't.  I encourage you to.  I've read that it was Conrad's favorite, and one can understand why, in Heyst we get a glimpse into the soul of the aloof author, and in the memorable final word of the novel we get an impression of what he saw in the world.  No other Conrad novel with the possible exception of Lord Jim has so personally affected me, and if like him, and like Heyst, you have sloughed off sentimentality, abandoned your Romantic side, then maybe this novel has something to teach you.   I certainly learned something+books
Distance and closeness and a way to bridge the gap.+P+_Victory_ is the first Conrad that I have read since reading _Heart of Darkness_  and _The Secret Sharer_ in high school. I was unsure what to expect before I picked up the book. In any case, I didn't expect it to be what it was-- so contemplative and so concerned with notions of isolation and the ability to act.   Despite the abstract themes, the book is neither slow nor unreadable. An adventure story wraps the whole thing up:   A recluse on a deserted island breaks his solitude and rescues a girl from a life with a semi-shady gang. This act of kindness starts a chain of events that brings violence and change to his small world.   The story moves along nicely, and you can read for the plot even if you are uninterested in the bigger issues the book raises. I found that I was interested in them. Heyst (the main character) has been infected by his father's skepticism and analytical viewpoint and never manages to find a way after that to engage with the world or other people in it. His few attempts at engagement are awkward and almost unwilling.   Everybody in the book is to some degree isolated. Wang removes himself from Chinese society to go native. Mrs. Schomberg is locked behind her mask of fear. Mr. Jones and Ricardo are set apart because of the obsessive fear the Gentleman has of women. Alma/Magdalena/Lena is set apart by her past. Everybody is trying to connect, but (with the exception of Lena) always on their own terms and always within limits.   It's tempting to read Conrad's own background and separations into the mix, but I'll leave that to the Conrad scholars.   Worth reading+books
Faithful Translation of the Word of God+P+I have studied some Greek and the original texts, and I must say many modern bibles are corrupting the Word of God, no only in the unliteral translations but faulty originals they use. The King James Version is  faithful, both in being literal and using authentic texts. The New King  james Version is faithful in this attempt, the only changes being bringing  the bible into more modern, but still respectful, English, and a few  clarifications of words which have changed their meanings. I recommend it  to all Christians+books
Funny what logic can do.+P+Oswald Allis was a champion of biblical interpretation of the "end-times" and of the role of the church in the 1930's. He  shows very clearly the distortions of the Bible that modern dispensationalists and the authors of the "left behind" books take for granted.  As an example of the impact of this book, I gave it to a confirmed dispensationalist in the mid-80's and asked her to read it and then discuss it with me. She read half of it and gave it back to me and refused to discuss it. Invincible ignorance had set in, refusing to even discuss the passages of Scripture that did not fit her Scofield-induced template of escatology.   The 1945 preface is prophetic: "Is their [the Jews] presence 'in the land' so important that Palestine should be regarded as belonging to them exclusively, and should they be encouraged to set up a kingdom there like that of David or Solomon? Should the Christians in all the Allied Countries use every effort to persuade their governments to insist at the coming Peace Conference that Palestine be given to the Jews? Is this the solution to the Jewish question? Or, is the reason that the Jew is a problem to be found in something quite different: in the fact that he rejected the Messiah promised to his race and was 'scattered among the nations' as a punishment for his sin, that he still continues in unbelief and yet still regards himself as a 'peculiar people,' whose destiny is to rule the earth under a Messiah who is yet to come?...Or, is his need, his supreme need, that heavenly salvation which is to be found only in the Christian Church?"  Another way of asking this is, did the Jew's presence "in the land" usher in peace and harmony for the Jews? Or for anyone? Read the headlines of today's papers and one can see that this whole enterprise was and is folly, and yet Christians still wear their Dispensational blinders, and it is staggering to behold.  If you'd like to know more about the end-times, Israel and the church, read this book with your Bible open. Those who do so will have their thinking challenged and appreciation of the Scriptures increased.  But I warn you--it doesn't fit the current evangelical mindset and may make you feel uncomfortable with the multitude of "Bible-teachers" who can't deal with the facts of Scripture+books
This book was horrible.+N+I love to read, and have all my life.  I don't know how I escaped reading "Mary Poppins" as a child, because I read nearly every other children's classic book.  I decided to read this aloud to my children precisely because I hadn't read it.  I was horrified as the book went on...if this Mary has a heart, I can't find it.  You'd have to use a microscope to find it.  Yes, there are strange adventures that are interesting.  I don't have a problem with that.  My problem is Mary  herself. She's nasty and mean, and there isn't one redeeming quality about her in the book.  I found myself disliking her more and more as the book went on.  Perhaps I was tainted in my viewpoint by the Disney version. But I'll gladly take that version, for once, over the book.  At least in the movie Mary could crack a smile and actually enjoy something.  In the book she's as friendly as a block of ice.  Watch the movie.  Forget the book+books
Camilla by Fanny Burney+P+Along with Belinda and The History of Sir Charles Grandison, essential reading for all Jane Austen enthusiasts. In Camilla you will find Austen's inspiration for many different characters and situations.  The 17 year old  heroine of the novel is Burney's most enchanting. Her adventures are rich  and surprising.The color of the 18th century infuses this book. Bring  handkerchiefs, for there is pathos aplenty, but in a pure, non-cloying  form. Eugenia, the stunted and unlovely but spiritually and intellectually  exquisite sister of Camilla provides the soul of the book.  This book  contains suspense, glamour, romance, great wisdom and greater folly.   Anyone who adores 18th C lit. will be sorry to turn the last page, though a  thousand preceded it.  In many ways this is Burney's happiest and most  hopeful book. It was written as she was celebrating her liberation from  spinsterhood into the estate of a married woman at age 40.  We would be  very lucky if anyone ever thought to turn this one into a film+books
misguided+N+i am chinese and i love dimsum.  my family would have dim sum every sunday morning in chinatown growing up.  now i married and there's no chinatown or good chinese food around where i live.  so i decided to learn how ot make them.   however i can't read chinese very well.  i bought this book because the recipes come in both chinese and english.    Anyway, this book tittle is  "Chinese dimsum" but the recipes in there isn't  as true to it's title.  There are great variety of food in Dim-Sum food.   most steamed meat dishes, variety steam dumplings and stuffed rice rolls, and rice cake.   However, this book offers only 3 dumpling recipes. those dumpling recipes are definitely NOT the kind you get from a dimsum restaurant.   Dim-sum is the heart of southern cantonese cuisine.  it's originate from canton china and is a southern style cooking. mostly steamed cooking recipes.  However, the dumpling recipes in the book are water dumpling, just like northern style. a lot more blend.  Northern style are the dumpling called for boiling method rather than steam cooking.  well those aren't dim-sum.  northern chinese people eat them as a real meal. the basics such  sui-mai, cao ji. ha-cao. si long bao,  are not in the book.  there great variety of appetizer size meat dishes are also missing.  80% of the books teaches you how to make chinese desserts.  quite honestly, chinese desserts are the grossest thing on earth.   only old chinese people like stuffs like black sesame past bun, red bean paste cake, red bean past sweet rice soup, peanut paste, and yam paste type desserts.   it has 5 or six different king of steam buns recipes, same dough but different meat stuffing.  well, i like steam buns, but it's not the main focus of chinese dim-sum.    i am very upset that i can not find a single recipe that i can call dimsum food+books
This book is a disaster!+N+I was forced to read this book in English class and it is terrible! If you want a book that will put you to sleep at night, this is the one. I dissliked this book because it seems that it is not even supposed to be entertaining!+books
facts you didn't know about Hitler+P+I'm somewhat of an history buff, especially WWII, but when my Mom bought me this book at a yard sale, I didn't know what I was in store for upon reading it.  There are lots of little known facts about Hitler's secrets  and his personal life.  We get a glimpse inside of Hitler's head to see  what makes him tick - it wasn't just his hatred of the Jews that drove him.   The book was just a conglomeration of interesting information, and  contains many rare photos.  If you like reading about Hitler or similar  topics, this book is worth buying+books
Ineffectiously Infectious+N+This book tries to explain how and why the media would try to send out its ideals to the masses through a selective exposé of certain television programs such as THE SIMPSONS, BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD, REN & STIMPY SHOW, MURPHY BROWN, LA LAW, COPS; political and celebrity personalities like the BUSH's, BILL CLINTON, WILLIAM BORROUGHS, PHIL DONAHUE, RUSH LIMBOUGH, PEEWEE HERMAN (Paul Reubens), THE JACKSONS, MADONNA, ICE T, and even quite peculiar for me even the whole controversy with one of my personal faves U2 over the legal frictions with a parody band called NEGATIVLAND (which is rather more documented on the documentary feature flick of the said group) and even more so about the band that I often refer to -  JESUS JONES regarding their music video for their perrenial track "Right Here Right Now" and the advent of MTV's outbreak with the likes of music videos from A-HA; BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN; and even more so mentioning the likes of `wanna-whats' like R.U. SERIOUS, and the cult of Genesis P-Orrige called THEE TEMPLE OV PSYCHIC YOUTH - the book nearly gives an impression that the author is culture-shocked, and proposed to infect likewise with the `memes' (ie. A term used by the author to refer about the certain data/info's that are being assimilated n=by the media which in turn affects to influence the masses, at least in the way I understood it and could simply put it) it presents to expose - however, the whole matter is subject to the particular perspective preference of the readers personal comprehension.  The book is said to have been "revised and updated" from a two-year's span by 1996 - even seems quite un-innovative even from that time, and most of the authors' analysis are nothing new. Rushkoff, although being quite informative nevertheless from time to time with the book only seem to mainly dwell on a surface level, when what we need is to see more of the primal motivating factors behind the dissemination of counter-culture trends and ideas which Rushkoff attempted to disseminate within the length of his work.+books
Neither global, nor a telecommunications book!+N+Neither author is a telecom professional. The LAN discussion is 1 page; the WAN discussion is 1 more page. The word &quot;enterprise&quot; does not appear in the index, but &quot;sexual motivation&quot; does. Likewise,  Frame Relay, ATM, SONET/SDH are omitted from the book. ISDN receives  exactly 2 sentences. The striking lack of Telecommunications and Technology  could be forgiven, except for the equally apparent lack of Global Business  discussion. The term &quot;multinational&quot; can't be found; neither can  &quot;ITU&quot; or its erstwhile equivalent &quot;CCITT&quot;. If you're  looking for a discussion or reference on the role of telecommunications in  the increasing global economy, this book is not for you+books
I can't read it!+N+I haven't been able to read it yet because THE PRINT IS SO SMALL! That's the only thing I can base my review on. I'm sure it's a fine book if you can read it+books
the cover is VERY misleading. +N+the cover is interesting, the description on the back makes it seem amazing! and when i read about 20 pages of the book, i'm in total shock. this is not the book that i had in mind.   first of all, this is the !MOST! unrealistic thing i have ever read. As hard as i tried, I could not get into the story. The language is very .. let me say this: it's complex poetry written in the simplicity for a five year old.+books
A very tough read.+N+As the title suggests, this is a book about improving your speed.  It is a general book applicable to any sport.  And so the authors go to great lengths to generalize their program.  I expected to read about the latest  in exercise physiology concerning speed, recommended training, and  exercises.  We do get that sort of thing in a manner of speaking, but to  put it very bluntly, this book is one of the most jumbled, mixed up,  illogical presentations you are likely to read.  Hard to believe three  college graduates put this together.  In order to get anything out of this  book you kind of have to trudge all the way through it and improvise your  thought process as you go.  The authors give absolutely zero help. Do we  get titles to the latest studies on sport speed--in the negative.  Do we  get information on the latest persons doing research on the subject--in the  negative.  Do we get a logical, understandable training program--in the  negative. What we get instead is kind of a hodge podge of information  coming from all directions without hardly any logical organized  presentation. Oh--there is the seven step speed training program presented  in 7 different chapters.  And to give credit--it does look like this is a  good speed improvement program.  However the information  the seven  chapters (and you have to get through 3 almost imconprehensible chapters to  get to the program) seems to rain down from the sky in a very disconnected  fashion.  There are few explanations of the whys and wherefores; there are  zero explanations on where the program comes from or how it was put  together, or where it fits in anywhere in what is being done by any one.   It is just there, presented, and I suppose we are supposed to swallow it  all on faith.  There are presented many descriptions and photographs of  useful looking exercises.  I do know more about speed improvement after  reading the book.  But the information was gotten by pulling teeth+books
Finally an accurate account!+P+The author has taken his time to present all sides of this important event in South Carolina history. By taking a dispassionate look at the contemporary accounts as well as later oral histories he allows one to make up his or her own mind as the the true events. I found no evidence of any political slant. Not a novel for light reading, but easy to read. Makes a case as a good text, not only in the realm of black history, but in how one event can be looked at from numerous eyes. Gives one a perspective on how the history we come to accept can be changed and minipulated depending on ones desires and point of view. Highly recommend this in any student of South Carolina or black histories library+books
agree with disappointment so far+N+I am disappointed and I haven't even read it yet.  If anything Steve has written and quoted out of the book is correct then it is just another case of the blind leading the blind.  Please read his review and decide for yourself.  I still plan to buy the book but as with everything else I will take it with a huge chunk of salt.  Sounds to me like the so called "Conservatives" have just put out another book to "unbiasedly" support their positions and make it easier to swallow by the masses.  There is no such thing as a conservative any more.  If you want to get back to constitutional government, go check out the Libertarian party and view their positions.  They come the closest to truly supporting a government of the people, by the people and for the people.  The rest of them are still just self serving and don't want to let go of their power and your money.  Dan +books
Not for all Jewish grandparents+N+This book should have been subtitled "the art of  assimilated jewish grandparenting" or "how to keep your granchildren a little bit Jewish".  If you're looking for a book about that buy it.  If you're looking for a nice book about how to grandparent a nuclear, jewishly oriented family, look elsewhere+books
"Apocalypse" Is a Big Help+P+I've heard several different interpretations of the book of Revelation in the Bible, but this one breaks the book down into its respective chapters/verses.  It's easy to get caught up in all the "fear and dread" that seems to come from many sources and it's great to read something that is more direct.  The author doesn't claim to have complete understanding, but does clarify some of the mystical language and symbolism.  This book will be a wonderful resource for our religious education classes.+books
Inequal Relationships+P+In The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, Anne Bronte proves herself to be just as capable a writer as her more famous sisters.  This novel is about the suffering of one woman living in an unhappy marriage, and Bronte uses that story to display the desperation of women of that time trapped in inequal relationships.  She also manages to show the strength and cleverness with which women managed to make use of what little power they had.  The characters are well-developed and come alive in every scene, and the dialogue of the novel is very powerful.    At the end, however, the story peters out; though the framing of the novel through a series of letters works well for most of the book, the last few chapters are weak, as Bronte tries too hard to create a firm end for every minor character she introduced throughout the book, and it doesn't quite fit with the narrative.  But besides those few pages, this book is solidly written and clearly conceived.  I strongly recommend it for anyone desiring a somewhat more realistic view of the period than presented by either of her sister's novels, but with just as great of writing+books
&quot;Failed To Keep My Interest&quot;+N+As a big proponent of a manned mission to Mars, I looked forward to reading this book.  While Baxter's characters showed a lot of promise, the slow pace of the story and lack of any possible conflict failed to keep my interest+books
Instant Inspiration+P+I am about to begin my first year teaching high school art, and this book has sparked more excitement for the career I have chosen than any other. I expect to return to it again and again when I need a pick-me-up during my upcoming "difficult first year" of teaching - it makes me feel LUCKY to be able to be in the field of education. Any teacher, novice or experienced, would find inspiration in this wonderfully easy to read and engaging book on meaningful teaching+books
What to say when you talk to yourself?!?!?!+P+This book has opened my eyes and gave me a completly different view about myself, beliefs and authority that I have over myself. It's one of those books that states things that we all know about; it just makes you aware of them and teaches you how to use it in order to become successful in your life. You must read this book!+books
Highly Spiritual+P+This book is a creeper.  A few months after you read it, you will realize that you love it.  Kerouak mentions the conceptualization of Dr. Sax in On the Road, where JK's main character talks about a book he is writing, and  mentions the ultimate scene in Sax.  The story is full of visuals that stay  in the mind.  Inspiration from Bram Stoker is evident, and mixes with old  radio serials adventure.  A coming of age story that is comic book, before  comic books were cool, and with a fantastic ending that is unexpected and  thought provoking.  A wonderful read every time+books
The Best+P+Of all the books on inner healing and deliverance that I have read, this one has been one of the two most helpful. Dr. Kraft not only explains what happens in a ministry session, he also explains how to do it. A must for those wanting to see God move in this type of ministry+books
Grudem Builds a Good Argument+P+Wayne Grudem has written a great deal about biblical manhood and womanhood. Besides articles in periodicals, he has written Recovering Biblical Manhood and Womanhood: A Response to Evangelical Feminism which he co-authored with John Piper. He has written Evangelical Feminism and Biblical Truth: An Analysis of More Than 100 Disputed Questions and then two collections of essays he edited, Biblical Foundations for Manhood and Womanhood and Pastoral Leadership for Manhood and Womanhood.  The latest addition to this list is Evangelical Feminism: A New Path to Liberalism?. Grudem describes this book as "an expression of deep concern about a widespread undermining of the authority of Scripture in the arguments that are frequently used to support feminism. It is also a way of posing a question: can a movement that espouses this many ways of undermining the authority of Scripture possible be right?" The book's argument, then, is that evangelical feminism sets those who affirm it on a slippery slope that will inevitably lead to liberalism.  It is important to define terms and Grudem, always a deliberate author, does just this. By theological liberalism he refers to "a system of thinking that denies the complete truthfulness of the Bible as the Word of God and denies the unique and absolute authority of the Bible in our lives." And by evangelical feminism he means "a movement that claims there are no unique leadership roles for men in marriage or in the church." Leadership in both the home and the church is to be shared equally between men and women according to their gifts and desires. He leads readers through five points:     1. Liberal Protestant denominations pioneered evangelical feminism and now evangelical feminists have adopted many of the arguments earlier used by theological liberals to advocate women's ordination and to reject male headship in marriage.    2. Many prominent evangelical feminist writers advocate positions that either deny or undermine the authority of the Bible. Other egalitarians endorse books written by these people without taking a stance against those who deny Scripture's authority.    3. Recent trends show that evangelical feminists are heading towards the denial of anything uniquely masculine and some now even refer to God as "our Mother in heaven."    4. The history of others who have adopted these positions shows that the next step is the acceptance of homosexuality.    5. The common thread running through these trends is a rejection of the authority of Scripture in people's lives--the very bedrock principle of theological liberalism.  These dire predictions aside, Grudem is careful to affirm that there are some egalitarians who continue to uphold the authority of Scripture (men like Roger Nicole, Walter Kaiser, Jack Hayford, etc) but warns that, while these men may remain orthodox, those who follow them will likely drift further and further from affirming the authority of Scripture, for this is a common pattern in the church. These men, despite their good intentions and their love for the Bible, may be inadvertently leading the next generation astray.  Grudem provides a short chapter liberalism and women's ordination, showing that there is no theologically liberal denomination or seminary in the United States today that opposes women's ordination. This proves that liberalism and the approval of women's ordination go hand in hand.  The heart of the book is contained in two sections. The first, with fifteen short chapters, examines evangelical feminist views that undermine or deny the authority of Scripture. These range from saying that Paul's teaching on women's roles was just plain wrong, to suggesting that women may preach or teach men as long as they are under the authority of a pastor, to relying on experience as the arbiter of what is right and true. The second section, with ten short chapters, examines evangelical feminist views that are based on untruthful or unsubstantiated claims. These include those who teach that Paul told the women in Corinth to "keep silent" because they were disrupted church services, that the word "head" actually means "source," and that the Son is not subordinate to the Father in the Trinity. Grudem concludes "I cannot say for sure. But I can think of no other viewpoint or movement within the whole history of the Christian church (except theological liberalism itself) that has generated so many novel and ultimately incorrect ways of interpreting the Bible."  Having provided the facts and having provided brief analysis, Grudem finally seeks to understand where evangelical feminism is taking the church. He concludes that the next step is to deny anything distinctly masculine. At the foundation of evangelical feminism, he feels, is a dislike of manhood itself. This will lead to a denial that there is anything uniquely masculine about God and allow people to refer to God as Mother. The danger here, of course, is that calling God "Mother" "is changing God's own description of himself in the Bible. It is calling God by a name that he has not taking for himself. Therefore it is changing the way the Bible teaches us to think of God. It is thus changing our doctrine of God." The final step along this trajectory is the widespread acceptance of homosexuality. Those who advocate the morality of homosexuality within a biblical context are using the very same arguments used by evangelical feminists. Churches that accept the arguments of evangelical feminists will have very little ground to stand on when they attempt (or if they attempt) to uphold the biblical condemnation of homosexuality.  What is ultimately at stake in evangelical feminism is the Bible itself. I appreciated Grudem taking his argument to its fullest extent and showing what is truly at stake here. Too often arguments about issues like evangelical feminism can proceed no further than the doctrine itself. I think Grudem has done the church a great service in showing and proving that this discussion is not merely about how particular churches operate. Rather, based on this discussion we can see which churches can remain faithful in the future and which will inevitably drift further and further from the authority of Scripture and thus further and further from God himself. If evangelical feminism is, indeed, a new path to an old problem, Grudem has shown just how seriously we need to take it+books
Origin+P+I really loved the book I just wish the author of the book would of used Kyles origin from the Comics+books
Great Buy+P+I am not a builder but I am planning to build GREEN.I wanted to be as informed as possible, so I could research the building requirments, communicate as intelligently as possible, hire the right people, choose the right architect, etc. This book gave me 98% of all the info I needed on a graywater system, even though I'm building in Pennsylvania and author is a Californian. I have "Create an Oasis With Graywater" also. These books have made my life much simplier.+books
Dreadful book+N+I am constantly amazed at what can get published.  The plot of this book requires the reader to suspend any sense of logic and rationality.  In fact, the plot is so far-fetched I thought it was a parody.  The characters are not believable at all.  The reader is supposed to believe that Mozart has been re-incarnated as Frankie.  Um right.  And I am the queen of Spain.  This is the first book by the author that I have read and I am not anxious to pick up another one.  I found the plot lines and character developments to be insultingly stupid.  Almost too embarassed to donate this book.  I pray for the trees sacrificed to make this+books
That's not sexy!!! That's creepy!!!+N+think about the premise, it's not only creepy, it's just wrong. The August brothers were sexually abused and victimized as young men and now the only way they can feel complete love from a woman is together. I know, I know it's total backwoods Jerry Springer crap!!! I really don't like books like this. Ones that have a racier theme or kink and wrap it up with a bow and call it "fufilling" or "complete love". Where I come from having a threesome or foursome with your brothers is just disturbed!!! And the women in story just buy into this warped way of thinking. I don't know about other ladies but if a guy I was dating suggested this; there would be a me shaped hole in the door, and burnt rubber in the driveway!+books
Three thums up!+P+While browsing aimlessly at a local bookstore, this title caught my eye. Just coming off of an enjoyable &quot;Wandering Hill&quot; read, I was primed for more hardscrabble, tooth and nail wild west yarn spinning. That's exactly what I got.  This book is very &quot;readable&quot; and kept me up way past my bedtime with its page turning, brutal charms and smoldering promise of sweet revenge. Do I care if it is historically accurate? NO.  My only gripe is that the book should be longer.  Then again, any more page volume would have killed Hugh Glass before his time, so maybe it IS the right length!  Get this book and enjoy+books
Deplorable+N+Let's start with being the nephew of Sigmund Freud.  Mr. Bernays witnessed the coming of the industrial revolution in full and his ideas were thus shaped believing that even men operate only as mindless automatons in the larger machinery of society.  The author believes that people are incapable of forming their own opinions due to the complexity of modern life.  Heck, these hickams from Topeka just came off the farm. Surely we in the elite must help them make their choices.  This is the tone of Propaganda.  Keep in mind that also during this time other similar misinformed ideologies were being incubated by Bernays contemporaries like Hitler and Stalin.  There is in truth much commonality between all three of these mens views.  All ideologies are dangerous and there seemed to have been a great number of squirrely ones developed at the beginning of the 20th century.  Bernays does have some karma to pay as this book was used by Hitler and the Third Reich as a kind of manual on how to deceive the masses.  And the Third Reich is not the last homeland to use Bernays ideas+books
Good overview for the uninitiated.+P+The book is not intended for students of Akkadian as there is no cuneiform or transcripted Akkadian. Everything is in translation. The book centers around the Enuma Elish (the biggest creation account), but has many other  smaller creation legends. There is a synopsis of the Elish as well as  various theories about its dating, composition, etc. There is also a  lengthy (58 page) article showing parallels to the Old Testament creation  account. The author does a good job of being objective, but leans toward  showing the uniqueness of the Genesis account and contrasts it quite a bit  against the remaining semitic literature+books
Use caution+N+The first few reviews are too harsh,I was given this as a gift so I am not as pissed off at the money. I give it two stars could have been three but for the fact that the hero's are way too perfect and they are dull- but it was not a book I expected much from anyway.  The plot also gets way to over the top.  I mean is there any plane or helicopter they cannot learn to fly in a weekend? Hero's invited to the summit by the President! They escape four attempts to kill them before they even get to China! Also hero knew the guy was Chinese just by looking at him for a less than a minute, how many white folks can tell difference among non whites? Why are all the Chinese Americans bad guys as well?   The novel is way to heavy with anit Chinese comments, has lot of what are just rants. See the other points in the publisher weekly review, but after considering them you may want to read the book, if you want to consider what we do if we and china butt heads, but have low expectation and know that in this world the good guys always win. Do not expect much and look for used copy, I paln to look to see if any of his other books get any better reviews before I cut him off.+books

A Testament of Love+P+As in many of his books, Jack London enraptes the reader, but this time in a story of love.  It is extremely refreshing because it shows the good side of true love without that sickening sweetness so many love stories have...  I read this book a few years back and read it again just recently. I am   SIXTEEN.  This book is definetly one that many can enjoy, no matter your  age+books
sadly dissapointed+N+I was very excited to read this book! I ran home, got comforable and started reading. I found myself skipping through the pages. I found it was very myth based, and too much about religion and Jesus and mary. I bought it because I love Tori and have been fascinated by her. I wish this book was more about her life, her childhood. I have read less then half this book,and I will either force myself to finish, or return the book. I really am sadly dissapointed. Tori is the singer and song writer that you can listen to over and over again. I have bought her CD's 3 and 4 times each because I listened too much and the CD was worn. I really don't suggest anyone to buy this, you will be let down, just as i was.+books
Not well researched and partisan+N+This may be the worst book I've ever finished.  I was expecting a book that would offer small tidbits of funny information, some shots, and some glorious facts about the great men who have led our country over the various centuries.  Instead, we are treated to a salacious compendium of president's peeing on secret service men and other president's blaming secret service men for farting.  If you are looking for "The Man Show" version of the presidents, then by all means fork over your hard earned dollars. We are informed that every Republican from IKE to Bush were bumbling idiots, and every Democrat from FDR to Clinton were mere victims of circumstance. If you are looking for a Michael Moore or Al Franken version of the historical lives of some of the greatest men who ever lived, then by all means add to cart. Thanks to this author's portrayal of U.S. Presidents, I will forever read an author's portrayal of the two most divisive presidents of our time, Nixon and Clinton, before I make such a purchase again. Nixon and Clinton were both failures in their own right.  Nixon and Clinton were both men blessed with an overwhelming amount of potential, but they both flushed it away with their individual incidents. O'Brien ends each portrayal with an accurate summary of the unfortunate end of each of the individual tenure, but it is within the body of these portrayals that O'Brien lends his creative writing skills to the eventual manipulation of the reader.  Examples to the point, Newt Gingrich is snide and rapacious, and Kenneth Starr is a ruthless Republican bloodhound. Do we really need these adjectives?  We read no such adjectives to describe the behaivor of the Democrats in power during Nixon's term. We see no adjectives or adverbs to describe the activities of a Woodward and Bernstein. I would consider it silly for a compendium of this sort to glorify the presidency of Nixon, for his tenure was not one to emulate. Nixon and Clinton had their otherwise promising presidencies brought down by silly incidents that would've been seen as such were it not for the cover-ups that followed. O'Brien goes onto to proclaim Bob Jones university as preposterously Conservative, he declares The Great Society as a legislative success. It maybe true that The Great Society was a success in accumulating enough votes for passage, but can the Great Society be considered a success in an historical perspective? He portrays the anti-American Carter as the greatest living former president in recent memory.  He mentions Carter's farcical Nobel Peace prize as testament to this fact. What is this? Everyone knows that that prize was a joke provided by the Nobel people looking to make an anti-American statement. It should be noted that the great peace activist Yasser Arafat also won this award. O'Brien fails to mention the Johnson administration's propaganda involving the Gulf of Tonkin incident that Johnson used to convince American's that America's role needed to be escalated in Vietnam. It was an incident historians are now claiming never happened, but this isn't used to define Johnson's administration? He maintains that every Republican since Ford gained office with shenanigans and slick marketing. He ends the book with the Moore/Franken style rants against the George W. Bush election, which many nonpartisan publications--including the Democrat Miami Herald and the USA Today--are saying they could've recounted until the end of time and Bush would've won.  He comments on Bush's slick maneuvering to enter into the war with Iraq. I will grant you that this book was written before news of the the oil for food UN scandals broke. These scandals involved France, Germany and Russia, and this scandal may have affected the manner in which pre-war activities were conducted. All in all, shouldn't a book of this variety be written to open debate rather than close it with propaganda material? I found some of the portrayals of presidents one rarely hears mentioned, such as Zachary Taylor and Franklin Pierce, but I found myself reevaluating all of these portrayals after reading about those with which I am much more familiar. I am currently an unsuccessful author, but I have written enough, and studied the craft enough, to know a writer's manipulation when I see it. It's a shame too, for this could've been such an interesting idea. As I have mentioned, Cormac O'Brien has taught me a valuable lesson when buying historical perspectives: try and learn the author's agenda before buying his book. I have read a couple of books of this sort that will lambaste and glorify an LBJ or a Clinton as often as they lambaste and glorify a Nixon or a Reagan. While I will agree that it is difficult for an individual to separate himself from his perspective, it should always be the responsibility of said author to keep this to a matter of degrees. It is my hope that the anxious readers who share my love for information, regardless of their individual biases, will search elsewhere+books
Best of Ludlum!+P+While reading Ludlum in between more artistic works of literature, I like to follow a good spy/action novel. Ludlum provides! Bourne Identity REALLY provides! It went through all things a good Ludlum novel ought to go through: action packed, twisting plots, romance, conspiracy, character thoughts, and, unfortunately, repetition. Five of those six are gems, but the repetition wore me out nearing the end. I can only read "Charlie is for delta; delta is for Cain" (or something like that) so many times... then I have to cringe, bite my lip and suppress an urge to scream at the annoyance.   If you could have someone black-out all these lines in the book before you read it, it would make the read so much more enjoyable+books
3.5 stars+P+On the heels of her return to work after an incident in which both she and her partner were injured, police detective Mia Mitchell is assigned a temporary partner, Reed Solliday, and a new case. There is a serial killer who is using arson to systematically eliminate a chain of victims. What makes matters worse is the unsub has added Mia to the target list.   *** The three main players, Reed, Mia, and the villain, all are fantastically complex as they work through issues of guilt and atonement. The intricate problems with which they deal form a fascinating web readers will be glad to be entangled in. ***  Amanda Killgor+books
Important addition to our language+P+Beinhart has done us a remarkable service by giving language to a new and critically important concept, that of the fact that is neither secret nor known.  By "fog facts," Beinhart means to indicate pieces of information that have been published on back pages of business sections of newspapers or picked up by a columnist or two, information that has perhaps been circulated on the internet by those with a passionate interest in the issue and enough free time, information that is accepted as known and established by reporters, editors, producers, and pundits, but which the vast majority of the public has never heard about and would find incredibly important and shocking.    The subtitle that Beinhart gives his website is "Known Facts That Have Been Lost in the Fog," and by the fog he means to indicate, as described in his book, the onslaught of abundant facts and information about unimportant stories: Monica Lewinski and O.J. Simpson are two examples Beinhart gives.  But Beinhart suggests at least one other force that helps keep some fog facts in the fog: people's reluctance to believe a really big lie.  This, Beinhart writes, is "why it was easy to believe that Bill Clinton lied about having sex with that woman and hard to believe that Bush and his entire cabinet were telling bald faced lies about Saddam's connection to Al Qaeda and his weapons of mass destruction."    In fact, one of the fog facts Beinhart discusses is the Downing Street Minutes+books
Stand Down+N+Samples taken from WTC steel now confirm (soon to be released by Professor Steven Jones of BYU and five other universities) Thermate was used in the WTC Towers to take them down. This meshes with the global collapse times of both Towers (and 7 WTC) and the eyewitness reports that day from firefighters, police, tenants and workers who said bombs were in the Towers. Not only do we have dispicable people in government who, of course, knew this all along, but the U.S. media knew it too. Soon both will be out of employment+books
Dated and Dry+N+This book is a rehash of stuff that has already been said about this product.  It is clear that the author did not close transactions but viewed credit derivatives as an academic.  Nothing new is said.  He could at least have written in an original fashion but decided to write about already exposed concepts in a very dry manner. +books
Pop Up!: A Manual of Paper Mechanisms+P+Excellent Book!  I have a nice collection of pop up books as well as books about their construction.  This book is outstanding.  The drawings are clear in their explanations and descriptions--much more so than photographs would be.  You can see the fronts, backs, sides, edges--whatever is pertinent to understanding the form being illustrated.  One especially nice feature is the author's explanation of things to watch out for--potential stumbling blocks to creating a functioning mechanism.  He begins with the basics and then demonstrates elaborations.  I think his illustrating applications of the forms is inspiring and informative--he goes beyond showing how to make,for example, a pop-up box and uses examples that show what a pop-up box might be.  I consider this book a "must have" for those interested in the subject+books
One of my favorites+P+I recently became interested in gardening (now that I have a yard in which I can plant).  This is one of my favorite books on gardening and landscaping.  Great resource for those of us living in the northeast.  Full of wonderful photos, explanations and illustrations.  It gives many ideas for addressing certain areas of your yard (i.e. front entryway, patio, rock wall).  Explanations are excellent; I learned a great deal from this book. Very well written.  Highly recommended+books
'Wise,' but debatably 'Quaker'+N+Appreciate the stories told by this author about his life and consider the insights that he has gained from reflection on his experience; but, please, do not base your understanding of Quakerism on his presentation.  In spite of the fact that Smith is a lifelong Friend and a former Quaker educator, he quotes George Fox (an important leader in the early Quaker movement) and the Bible inaccurately or out of context several times.  In addition, some of Smith's statements about facets of Quaker faith and practice are historically unfounded or ignore the diversity within the Religious Society of Friends today. If you are interested in learning about Quakerism, read Wilmer A. Cooper's book, A Living Faith: An Historical Study of Quaker Beliefs (Friends United Press: 1990).  Read Robert Lawrence Smith's book as a book of wisdom written by a Quaker, but not necessarily a Quaker book of wisdom+books
Lee does it again!+P+This book compiles about 23 issues of spidey's earlier adventures, going through many important chapters. It doesn't seem to give quite as much satisfaction as the first three volumes, perhaps because most Spidey fans have seen reprints of some of the issues contained in this volume. If you're new to spidey, snag this... if you're not new, still get it to fill in your blanks =)+books
Interesting but the hero goes off course+N+Catherine Coulter lets this story get a bit off course.  When the hero Phillip finds and takes care of Sabrina for five days because of her illness and the snow storm leaving them trapped in a hunting cabin. During the time in the cabin he is very attentive and ready to protect her after he finds out her brother-in-law attemped to rape her but failed and still planned to do so later.  When Philip finally succeeds in getting Sabrina to marry him for he compromises her by taking care of her the five days in the hunting cabin.  He later becomes so insensitive to her feelings almost one step from being just like her brother-in-law when he physically hits her.  I thought she went why off character then.  The story redeems itself towards the end.  I love her bride series and the Calypso Series, but this book left me lacking+books
Educational+P+I am impressed with this book. It's easy to read and understand, and I learned a lot about the importance of magnesium and how it helps us to function.  I have shared this book with friends and family so they can improve their diets and learn how a magnesium deficiency affects their health. My daughter has NOT had a migraine since she has incorporated this mineral in to her diet.  That in itself made the purchase worthwhile. Highly recommend+books
Great beginning book+P+Great introductory book. Besides just the rules, it also includes basic strategy and tactics+books
The kid's 5...and she says she's &quot;in love&quot;!+N+Junie B. Jones: Kindergartener. She's worrying about having a boyfriend and living &quot;happily ever after&quot; in her strange Junie-like world. First of all, her grammar is horrible and is fighting over this poor little 5-year-old boy named Warren, who just wants to be left alone. Even Lucille and Grace liked him, and Junie B liked him because he was on a T.V. commercial. I'm 9 now, and I think Junie B has lost her mind of wanting a boyfriend. Then, she begs her mom to go to the mall so she can buy princess clothes to make Warren notice him. She made comments like: &quot;And he was beauty to our eyes...&quot; &quot;What a chunk.&quot; and &quot;...I think I'd like him as my new boyfriend.&quot; She said she needed to &quot;move on in her life&quot;, which I thought was silly. OK, so she learned you shouldn't make friends by buying fancy stuff to make him or her like you, but Junie B needs to quit thinking about boys and more about her English+books
He talks a lot but doesnt say much+N+I bought this hoping for wise advice on financial matters. I instead found this book to be 200 pages of talk without substance. The points it makes (dont retire, quit work, die broke) are remade over and over in different ways without much of any intelligent argument as to why or how. I felt the book was not worth a read at all and was just a bunch of fluff to make up 200 pages. It was poorly organized as well with different subjects per each chapter. For example chap. 8 is "Accountants" through chapter 46 is a one page chapter on "Savings Accounts." I couldnt believe how many words were used that never said anything. Blah+books
EXCELLENT+P+This story of the battle for New Orleans is interesting and extremely well written.  It is not one of those deeply detailed scholarly works that drags on and on with details that you are not particularly interested in.  Mr. Groom quickly lays out the facts of the matter.  What he does best is make the historical figures in his book come alive for the reader. Andrew Jackson,  no matter what his faults, truly loved the United States and was more than willing, almost eager, to risk his life for his country.  And, at the battle of New Orleans, with the future of the United States at risk, a pirate/privateer named Jean Laffite took the side of Andy Jackson.  The battle they fought together, alongside the people of New Orleans, is amazing.   This briskly written book will tell you about some fantastic and tragically brave people+books
Best Book+P+I enjoyed the book Emergency: True Stories From The Nations ER, since the stories were all based on actual events. There are some that will make you laugh till you cry and there is some that are real heartbreaking.But I rate this book five stars, and would recomend anyone to read it+books
Awesome orthopedic reference+P+This book is an awesome reference for outpatient rehab progression. Provides conservative through aggresive rehab protocols.  Allows for comparison of various protocol+books
Throught Provoking Concept+P+I have to say, a lot of people will find this book to appear unbiblical if they do not know their Scriptures exceptionally well.  The Scriptures do not say, "The 2nd Coming is the final coming" - otherwise the dispensational millenialists ("Left Behind" ideology) would really be in trouble since they have at least 2 returns of Christ, the "hidden" rapture before the tribulation (book 1 in the Left Behind series), as well as the "glorious appearing" (the final book in the Left Behind series).  This book is a good example of what theologians (like myself) refer to as "speculative theology" - theology based not on what Scripture says, but what Scripture has not discussed one way or the other.  He asks the question: could Christ have an "intermediate return" before the "glorious appearing," but nothing like what the "Left Behind" ideology is projecting?  Could the current state of Israel be about bringing forth this intermediate return, and not the final one?  Or could it have nothing to do with the final return?  All these questions are thrown out there for the reader to contemplate and consider.  Excellent piece, well worth the money+books
Focus+N+Mr.Warren seems to have trouble focusing on the subject matter in the first half of this book, making it seem to be merely a digest of fantasy and science fiction. I guess one can enjoy this book if you are open  minded, very open minded. There are however more serious and factual  findings on this subject for the more serious UFO fans. If you must buy the  book, save your cash and buy the paperback+books
If this is classic nature lit, then maybe its just me...+N+I am going to resign from critiquing this book on a literary scale, and just say that I didn't enjoy this book for the same reason a couple others mentioned - its boring and repetitive. Maybe its because I'm not used to aimless - albeit eloquent -landscape descriptions, or maybe it's the fact that NOTHING happens for 264 pages, but reading this book felt more like a chore than an enjoyable reading experience. Case in point: Casual readers beware+books
Terribly boring+N+This is easily the most boring book I have ever had to read for a class.  While the case studies are fairly interesting and thought-provoking, the actual instructional portions of the book are very dry and hard to read+books
Useful study of academic bias+P+American academic Ido Oren started his research by looking at the common idea that democracies do not fight each other. He shows how studies only support this idea because our concept of democracy is produced by the same historical patterns against which the claims are `tested', a history partly shaped by the USA's international rivalries.  So, before World War One, Woodrow Wilson, the political scientist, described Imperial Germany as an advanced constitutional state, a model for administrative reform. Yet when he became President, Woodrow Wilson took the USA into war against Germany, and described it as an autocracy.  Oren looks at American political science as an ideology: its claims to uphold the ideals of liberal democracy, as expressed, for instance, by Samuel Huntingdon, a past President of the American Political Science Association. Yet the apartheid government used Huntingdon's writings, as when he backed it against `the worse alternative' of a government led by `the revolutionaries of the ANC'. He advised the apartheid government that increased authoritarianism might be necessary for reform, rationalising its repression, and he backed its `centralization of power'. Typically, the CIA funded some of his research.  Oren studies American political science's characterisations of the USA's chief enemies last century, its concomitant characterisations of the USA, and its involvement in the wars against Imperial Germany, Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. "I document a systematic pattern of change in the portrayals of these enemies before and after their conflicts with us." Also, he shows the pattern of concurrence between US wars and transformations in political science's visions of the USA. The Soviet Union was seen as all state, no society, the USA as all society, no state.  He chronicles the growth of intimacy between the political science profession and the State Department, especially during the US attack on Vietnam. Oren asks whether `American political science might be more attached to America's regime than to democracy'. He concludes that it indeed works from the US state, not an objective, perspective.+books
Boring+N+Wow...This book was boring and confusing.  I got it for my international finance class and it is just really hard to follow.  It was a waste of money+books
Theorical and Practical+P+This book, containing plenty of cases in accordance with each topic in every chapter, gives readers hand-on perception on how the theory exists within the business world. I especially love chapter 8:&quot;Channel Power&quot;, which specifies 5 powers a manufacturer or distributor may owns and how to deploy them properly in different situation or period. While you read, the book keeps you thinking about your own business and desiring to apply these breakthrough knowledge tomorrow, great+books
Roanoke Island Colony of Freedmen+P+Even though I am a self-taught researcher of local and NC history and genealogies, I had not heard of this publication until I saw the author on PBS TV.  I ordered the book from ... and am still in the process of reading it.  It seems well documented and contains information I was not aware of until I read this book.  I have helped two different African-American individuals research their families and so this subject was of interest to me.  I recently was in court as a juror and was approached by a bystander who heard me describe my &quot;line of work.&quot;  I told her of this book and how she could obtain a copy.  She said she would like to add this publication to her personal library of publications on Black Research.  I purchased this book for our local historical/genealogical library so that it could be used by everyone doing black research.  I ony live about 60 miles as the crow flies from Roanoke Island and had never heard of this Freedmen's Colony until now+books
A Must Read for Small-Business Owners & Managers+P+I purchased this book and was able to read it cover to cover in just a few days.  Glenn Shepard has created a wonderful step-by-step guide that I consider a MUST READ for every small-business owner and manager or supervisor.  As a national workshop leader Glenn combines his own experience as a business owner with the experiences and research from more than 100,000 managers from Forture 500 companies and small businesses alike.  The author writes in a very straight forward manner -- and I like how he does not pull punches with addressing difficult employee behavior issues.  Practical and informative -- I will require all my managers to read+books
An insightful and accessible glimpse into the spirit world+P+Psychic medium Christopher Valentine and claircognizant/clairvoyant medium Christian von Lahr present If You Could Only See... A Gnome's Story, a metaphysical introduction to the world of Gnomes, Faeries, Elves, and Leprechauns. If You Could Only See... is not a fictional fantasy novel, but rather the genuine spiritual story of the Nature People who live in an Aetheric Plane, as told in their own words through von Lahr's mediumship and telepathy. Questions and answers concerning these altruistic beings, as well as means by which the reader can share their love of Nature with these creatures and enhance the richness of personal life, fill the pages of this psychic testimony. An insightful and accessible glimpse into the spirit world, accessible to all readers willing to explore the possibility of realms and creatures who exist beyond the five senses+books

An amazing sequel!+P+If you were stunned by "Gridlinked," and left awe-struck by "The Line of Polity," then I guarantee you won't be disappointed with "Brass Man." Picking up almost immediately after the end of Line, it continues the saga of ECS agent Ian Cormac, and weaves narratives for many characters introduced in the previous two novels - plus several fascinating new ones - into an extremely satisfying whole. Best of all, it brings back one of the most unique and enigmatic of all of Asher's creations - the flawed yet noble Golem Twenty-Five, Mr. Crane+books
Powerful+P+I had the privilege of spending an afternoon at the Long Island home of Pietro Di Donato many, many years ago when a friend of mine, John Liscio,took me to visit.  Mr. Di Donato's father, I was told, died when he fell into a vat of cement back in the days when there were no labor laws to protect workers.  The book was shaped from this incidence.  Powerful book, and an even more powerful man.  Both left an indelible impression+books
Wow! This book was sooooooo BAD!+N+I have read 3 other Sue Margolis boks and enjoied them all. This book was really really BAD+books
Get Off The Beaten Path+P+Be sure to look for the newer edition (2003) as it covers 70 small towns. I started out thinking I would just dip into this, and read a few pages here and there. Then it turned out to be so interesting with Florida history, local tidbits, interesting people and architecture, that I read it straight through.  Now I can't wait to visit Havana to see the antique shops or to see the 36 murals in Lake Placid.  Some of the towns merely have interesting names (Yeehaw Junction) or a single sight, but many sound worthwhile for a day trip or longer visit. Probably should keep this book in the car while in Florida and check it occasionally to see if you are near any of these interesting places.  It is arranged by regions (north, central and south)+books
Having a Mary Spirit - Change Us from the Inside Out+P+Ok, the title gets 5 stars. I haven't had the priviledge of reading it yet myself. Gave this as a gift. The recipient praised the author and was eager to begin reading it.+books
The WORST book I've ever recorded...+N+When I was first chosen to narrate this book, I knew nothing of the racist past of its author -- I knew only that it was the single worst book I'd ever been assigned.  The negative AudioFile Magazine review of the recording (quoted here on Amazon) is completely fair.  Reading the book to myself in order to prepare to record it, I found it annoying in the extreme -- the so-called prose is precious and poorly written, and the allegedly authentic colloquialisms are grating.  When it came time to say it all aloud, for the first time ever (and I've narrated upwards of 200 audiobooks) I found it impossible to invest this piece of literary flotsam with any emotional content whatsoever.  As declining the job was no longer an option, I merely tried to stay out of the way and give it as simple and logical a performance as I could, but I was unable to compensate for the God awful writing, and unable to disguise my contempt for the entire enterprise.  It remains the worst recording I have ever done, and I was, for a time, quite ashamed of it.  Now that I discover more about its hate mongering author, I'm actually quite pleased that the recording stinks.  I now believe I gave this garbage exactly the reading it deserved.  (I must add that I learned a valuable lesson: never record a book you loathe.  I was subsequently offered the execrable "Left Behind - The Kids" series for young adults, but having suffered through "Little Tree," knew better than to lend my voice to the spewing of "Christian" hate.+books
not much value+N+This is a very simplistic book and reading it provided me with no knowledge that I didn't already have.  The author could get across every point in the entire book in a five page summary.  He starts by telling us about the broken window theory put forth in 1982 and illustrated a few examples of how it lead to lower crime.  He references both the original Atlantic Monthly article, as well as "The Tipping Point" (which I highly recommend), and some other texts and speeches that are written much better than his book and that actually contain original and interesting information.  The author explains in very simple language how this theory can be applied to business.  Essentially the entire book says that "broken windows" in business are the little things that go wrong, and how a business can't afford to let this happen.  He spends almost half of the book talking about how "people can be the ultimate broken window" and how customer service is one of the most important aspects of your business.  These concepts are so simple, that they are basically just reiterations of common business sense.   This book does not probe deeply, nor does it even come close to actually delivering any insight or analysis beyond the most superficial.  While his case studies are potentially interesting, he doesn't spend more than two pages on any given one.    This book is only worth reading if you want some simple concepts and rules that you already know listed in a convenient format.  Personally, I found that buying and reading this book was a waste of time.  There are plenty of other books about business that contain information and insights that you don't already know+books
Vital reading for Americans+P+This is a valid reprint of THE pivotal book written by the eugenicist founder of the Birth Control League - renamed Planned Parenthood when the world found out what her elitist-racist thinking came to in Germany in WWII.   Every human being in the country and the world really should know exactly what that crackpot's plans for reengineering humanity meant, and what her followerd are intent on, even as you read this.   +books
Arms and the Man+N+The book I am going to talk about is the book Arms and the Man By Bernard Shaw. I really did not like this book because it was hard for me to understand.  The reason I didn't like it was because it was challenging for me. The English was hard to understand. I liked how the writer wrote the book and I would probably look for another one of his books. This book was more like an opera with out music. If I could have and known to I probably would not have this enthusiastic about the book. One reason I picked the book was because it was dealing with war and I thought it would have been cool to read about war, but when I got more in to the book it was really not about war it was more about a love at war. If you're an older audience it would be a good book, or if you're looking for a good love-war story.+books
For Cold-Callers Only!+N+Should be titled 'Art of Selling Products, Making Hundreds By Manipulating Prospects'. Excellent for brokers or insurance agents looking for a quick fix in getting appointments or products sales, but the buzz will wear off.  A big disappointment for fee-based planners or advisors looking to expand  their client base. It deals more with manipulating prospects over the phone  than with practical face-to-face financial services sale+books
A Proud Korean Parent+P+I am very proud to be a Korean parent because I read this book.  This book explains the suffering of the Korean parents all over America.  Korean children often do not appreciate all the difficulties their parents had to go through to give them the University of California education.  Many Korean parents work in harsh conditions and work long hours and experience all kinds of anti-Korean insults by whites.  This book explains the pain that Korean parents had to go through.  It is difficult to explain all my pain to my children.  It's difficult when they are young because I don't want to burden them.  It's difficult when they are old because it seems petty and they seem to be going through problems of their own.  But Korean parents suffer in America as immigrants who work hard to reach middle class.  This book is great because I can just give to my children to read and they can understand my hardships just by reading about it.  I have friends who can't even speak English so they can't communicate to their children about their experiences.  For such a Korean parent, this book is ideal.  I recommended this book to them+books
The renewed examination of Babe Ruth's life and career+P+Baseball fans with an affection for the sports history will relish the renewed examination of Babe Ruth's life and career, which packs in almost a hundred photos to supplement anecdotes from those who knew him.

A Splendid Collection From The Master+P+This is a fascinating collection of puzzles from the master of mathemagics.  It's clear and undeniable: if you want the best in fun, challenging puzzles, buy anything written by Gardner or his heir apparent,  Terry Stickels.  You can't go wrong!!+books
One of a beautiful series+P+This book has absolutely beautiful paintings that compliment the familiar song Over the Rainbow.  My 5 year old daughter likes it a lot.  Her absolute favorite in the series is I Live In Music by Ntozake Shange, which is part of this series, and might seem odd for a pre-schooler, but her whole class really responded to it as well+books
Way Too Fluffy for My Taste+N+This book should have been called "Beautiful Interior Designs that Happen to Include some Home Theater Gear", or "Home Theater Style".  It's little more than a pretty picture book of impressive-looking rooms that integrate HT gear, and often in a laughable way.  The text is fluffy, thowaway stuff that is irritating to read.  The photos are very well done, but often include speakers and other gear set up with no unsightly cables.  Of course, without the unsightly cables, there'd be no audio or video, either.  I guess that's the main thing that got to me -- if you're going to show a setup with nice speakers and other gear that are out in the room, at least be honest about how to treat cables and make them look as good as possible.  Don't just leave them out altogether.  It's insulting, and is foolish in a book that is supposedly about HT+books
Regarding Vitalistic Spiritistic Woo-Woo:+N+In terms of vitalism spiritism supernaturalism, I particularly enjoy this line: "the organic foods you eat have a spirit of their own, one that will blend with your spirit and strengthen and empower your vital force [p.354]."  This one is good too:  "when the right herb is selected [...] its vital life force works synergistically with that of the patient [p.004]."  Maybe this is my favorite: "a plant, which is a living and breathing entity, has the ability to understand and work in synchrony with the body's internal needs, in harmony with the vital force within us, to heal and give life [p.094]."  Generally, 'like curing like,' 'as X' curing 'X,' is known as sympathetic magic (SM).  These quotes are of the vitalistic spiritistic supernaturalistic (VSS) herbalistic strain of sympathetic magic (VSSHerbSM).  As apposed to the homeopathic strain (VSSHomSM).   -rc+books
too bad, too sad+N+I want to change the world sounds noble enough but with the fluff in between these covers, this &quot;world changer&quot; has some time, if ever, to go until he can lay any claim to this. Karims fellow designers should be outraged by his presentation of their industry as being so fickle, tranparent and thin. A real shame given the power that products have in our lives and to our cultures.  Do not buy this book+books

Lacking depth & character development+N+"Envy" is a hard book to pin down. In a nutshell, we have Will Moreland, a New York therapist who has elected to go to his college reunion. His wife Carole prefers to stay home since she does not know anyone and they are still feeling the emotional tug of the loss of their son, Luke. During the reunion, most people are more concerned with the whereabouts of his twin brother Mitch, a pretty famous long-distance swimmer, whom Will is estranged. After reading about some of his former collegiates, he comes across the bio of former flame Elizabeth and discovers that she has a daughter that could possibly be his. When he asks her, she justifiably balks at him.  He returns home, and seeks out a therapist of his own to discuss his intimacy issues with his wife, as well as his dark sexual fantasies, as they are starting to interfere with his effectiveness at his own practice. He is also having problems with the abandonment of his twin, who he has not seen since his wedding day. Mitch was born with birthmark that made him stand out to ridicule as a child. Will always felt guilt that his own face was not marred. Little does he know that the brother that he protected since childhood made a mockery of his devotion, as he slowly learns the truth behind Mitch's absence.  A new patient arrives in his office with her own intimacy issues. She is a student and seduces older men. When she relishes in telling him about her sex life in detail, it is evident that her next victim is going to be Will. After she makes an inappropriate move on him, he decides to terminate their relationship and refers her elsewhere. Soon, she is knocking down his door, insisting that he see her. When she disrobes, Will's own lack of willpower triggers a sexual escapade which he will forever wish did not happen, particularly when the patient reveals who she is.   Suddenly Will questions is own relationship with his wife, former lovers, his brother, and his parents. This really could have been a moving story, but I did not feel a connection in any way to the storyline - there was no real emotion, depth, or character development. The revelation of the student's identity is no surprise - anyone can se that coming. All told in a matter-of-fact manner, with little emotion, the story never has any clear resolution, nor any closure, making it a bit of a disappointment+books
One of E. Nesbit's best+P+One of the delightful things about this book is that it treats children as thinking beings, yet still manages to contain all of the magic and adventure of childhood. As in all of her work, E. Nesbit tells an exciting story while encouraging the reader to consider the meaning of things.  One  of the best books written by one of the best children's writers of all  time+books
Very outdated!!!+N+First, FIX THE DATE IN THE DESCRIPTION AMAZON!!!!!  In spite of Loopy's warning I ordered this book in hopes he had just received old inventory. Wrong! I received the same 1995 book and when I complained to Amazon they sent me a replacement. Another 1995 book. While the information in the book appears good, it's describing conditions over 10 years old which could be a lifetime for a trout stream. The Clark Fork, for example, is described as "teetering between two possible futures-magnificence and ruin." My online research has indicated the Clark Fork has continued to recover nicely from the heavy metal runoff from the mining but if this book were my only guide I would be skeptical about including it as a destination for my trip.  If this book were up to date I would give it at least 4 stars. But considering the age I would recommend you pass and search for other sources+books
almost unreadable+N+The text is thoroughly unorganized, it has almost no coherent linear progression. The author often repeats himself, uttering the "Final Solution" of the "Jewish question" over and over without giving an studied analysis of what that means. The book is a pistache of accusations and anecdotes about people's involvement in the "final solution" without offering any studied analysis of any one particular group or person. For example, we are introduced to a commander Wohlauf--an office of Battalion 101---and his wife. We are told that he killed Jews and his pregnant wife watched, but thats about it. The author also infuses his writing with pedantry: rather that presenting the facts as they are, he is compelled to make the reader feel shocked by using exclamation points to drive home how we should feel.  Undoubtedly antisemitism was endemic not only in Germany, but throughout Europe, but one gets the feeling that the author is cherry picking throughout history  to bolster his outlandish thesis that the Germans were predicated to mass murder of Jews. +books
useless text+N+You'd better hope you've got a good professor for dynamics, because this book is absolutely no help. It gives proofs for most equations, but doesn't seem to think any amount of example problems are necessary. I have the bootleg copy of the solutions manual for this book and the author solves most of the problems with bizarre calculus that isn't discussed in the chapter at all.  To top it off, the set (Statics and Dynamics) was $180 at my college bookstore. Pool your money with your classmates, buy one copy of each, and xerox the problems. You will not miss anything+books
Hit Low and Hard then don't look back+P+Once in awhile a new collection of stories by a single author comes along that grabs the reader and forces him to take notice. Karl Wagner's posthamous &quot;Exorisms and Ecstasies&quot; was one and Harlan Ellison's &quot;Love ain't nothing but sex mispelled&quot; was another. Norman Partridge comes along and takes us for a spin along a gravel track with motor's spiting fire and both carbs blazing. This is a major contender for a World Fantasy Award, produced by Night Shade Books with a real cloth binding, a killer cover painting and an attention do detail that will leave you breathless. This collection offers 24 stories from Partridge that turned this reader into an instant fan. Be warned, if your idea of literature is a safe escape from the mundane world, don't get this book. Nothing is safe about it, it will grab you, hit you low and hard - but you won't look back and nothing will ever be safe again+books
History keeps repeating itself.+N+This is a tale of two rigid and megalomaniac men butting heads. 500 years hasn't changed human nature - that's for sure+books
Why did she have to tell the story THAT way?+N+I have been a fan of Lois Lowry's books for years, and have appreciated some of the other ways she has handled disability before.  That is why I had trouble with how she handled it in this book.  Much of my family in the era this book is written lived in rural areas, and many were said to be "touched", with the same conditions that cause me, for instance, to be unable to speak or relate to people in the usual way.  They were also accepted in their communities a lot more than I have been in modern urban settings, and none were a danger to their communities.  I enjoyed reading about similar settings to the ones in my family stories.  That is why the ending was so shocking.  There is a stereotype of disability that has caused disabled people to be removed from our families for a long time.  This one runs that we don't know any better, but have sinister tendencies lurking somewhere in our inability to understand certain things.    It makes for a plot device that is accepted by many non-disabled people.  Rain Man went to an institution and is supposed to stay there his whole life because he "might hurt the baby", even though there are ways of preventing that kind of thing without taking such drastic measures, and even though that kind of thing is not common among autistic people.  The boy in this story does something similar, with similar results.  To people unfamiliar with this stereotype, or who believe in it, this plot device may seem powerful, and a way of advancing the sensitivity of the main character who knows that he "didn't mean to do" what he did.  To me, it seems like a shortcut.  Many people in roughly that era were institutionalized because of widespread prejudices that they would hurt someone, or rape their sisters, or other things that turned out not to be how it usually actually happens.  The story, to me, would have been more powerful by far if it had addressed those kind of real problems, rather than using the hackneyed storyline that is easier to write, perhaps, but advances those very same stereotypes.  I wonder how many readers of this book will do the same sort of thing as one young mother did when she refused to allow me to board at her house because she had a small child and believed I would hurt him because I am autistic.  That is the true danger in "They're dangerous, but they can't help it."  I wonder what kind of thing she had heard and read to form a strange opinion like that.  The author is a good author, and from the point of view of someone who might well have had the same social status in that era as the boy did, she could have written him, and even handled the issues around this kind of idea, much more responsibly+books
Welcome back my friends, to the show that never ends...+N+"When will it end?? NEVER! MUWHAHAHAHAHA!"  REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*****  First off, up until this point, I found the series moderately entertaining (especially the 2nd book). Granted, in every book, there are certain aspects of Jordan's redundant writing that are very annoying. For instance, the childish, and extremely immature thoughts and actions of the female characters. Realistically, in a time period like that, if a woman acted as arrogant and sexist as they do in this book series, they would get a good "thumping" and be forced to learn from their mistakes (As would anyone really). Instead, the men grovel like slaves around the women. It's very annoying and infinitely un-realistic. Even in fantasy, there are certain rules one must follow pertaining to the characteristics of the human race. Hardly anyone in this series of books makes a rational, practical decision. There is hardly any Logic here, and when someone who is supposedly "Wise" speaks up, its merely common sense that hopefully everyone in real life should, and probably does know. Most of the so-called "intellectual" sayings in this book bassically translate to somthing a 10 year-old kid would know.  Human characteristics aside, Jordan has a great attention to detail when it comes to scenery (Clothing, geography, battle fields etc...) Hardly anything is left out. I suppose this is good, if one really wants to leave the real world and become part of the reality that Jordan has created.   But here we are...at the 5th book. I hate to say it, but not enough happened in the time-line to justify 5 long books. Sometimes, it is hard to tell just how much time has passed from one point to another. Jordan has virtually no sense of time at all in these books. This can either be as an excuse for such a long series, or its just basically poor writing. I'm a little undecided on that.   This book is full of the usual aspects that the previous 4 had:  1. Most of the men can't think for themselves (However there are a number of Characters that I do like allot. Uno, Julian, Matt, Asmodean, Lan, Thom, Loial (Who isn't even in this one..go figure) What happened to Elays?? Uhg..  2. The female characters whine and complain like my 2 year old daughter  3. Rand's increase in the One Power, is directly proportional to how much of a complete idiot he is turning into. It all started when he absolutely refused to believe he was the Dragon Reborn (End of Book 1 I believe). It takes him a number of books to finally stop being so damn immature and finally step up, and take action. This is the ultimate annoying aspect in this series. Rand attains the 'Sword that cannot be touched'. A weapon that can level cities...What does he do? Shoves it into the floor at the Stone Of Tear, and scampers off into the woods for another adventure. Wow..smart huh?   4. The Forsaken are scheming as usual. It's a mystery to me that they were picked by the Dark One. Powerful as they may be, they're mostly stupid, too paranoid, and un-trustworthy of one another. It would make more sense to create a truce and simply eliminate Rand. They could. Everyone knows they could. But they don't...Frustration level ever increasing...  This series seems to remind me of a poorly written play with too many characters to have on stage at any given time. Jordan seems to shove various ones on for certain amounts of time, then shove them off, with hardly a word of goodbye.   Something that I must point out is the way Jordan decides to kill off, or deal with the "Evil" characters. This whole re-incarnation nonsense is spoiling the importance, and fear of death. I believe it is wrong to kill off so many "Evil" characters at one time. Characters that have potential are eliminated.  And yes...Asmodean. Here comes my biggest gripe of all.. I rather liked Asmodean, his character was interesting, and it was rather refreshing to have someone cross over from the "Evil" side, to "Good" side (Even if it was un-willingly). He does provide a lot of insight for Rand. If I was a Forsaken, I would defiantly cross over to Rand's side, it only makes sense. BUT...Instead of keeping Asmodean alive and allowing him to help Rand with his great struggle...He's killed off at the end of the book.   Right there, Jordan drops a huge amount of story potential, and trades it for the same, un-inventive, one-sided drivel that the rest of this book contains. Then Rand goes on to Kill Rhavin. Another interesting Character wasted. Lanfear has also been killed (as far as we know). Again, another interesting character wasted. I could care less about Moraine. After the first book, her character is basically rendered useless, and is completely unneeded.   All in all, Jordan has a tendency to do away with the interesting characters (Hurin, Ingtar, Elays etc..) And keep the boring, immature ones. (Nynaeve, Egwene, Elayne, Aviendha etc...)   The series is simply too long, and I'm positive it has over 1000 pages of material that needs to be discarded. If Lord of Chaos is as bad as this one, I'm burning my collection and sending the remains to Jordan's house.   So, to those who are in the midst of this series like I am, I say to you; 'Welcome back my friends, to the show that never ends'. +books
A thoughtful novel+P+Under Western Eyes is not a light novel but a deep, refelctive study of the Russian intellect and society. This book permitted me to understand what we westerner's often cast of as the &quot;Russian personnality&quot; and the complexity of the historical, social and psychological climate of Russia and the Russians shortly before the Bolshevik revolution. This novel does not ressemble any ohter of Conrad's as it has a strange feeling or atmosphere to it that can barely be grasped. I read it when I was young and I was deeply affected by the people he describes and the locations. A must for anyone interested or related to the Russian nation+books
Exquisite Use of Language+P+Whether the subject is human nature, race, class, politics, or theology, Julian Barnes expresses more on a subject in a paragraph than many of us in a chapter. And all of this on top of a fascinating story+books
small graces+N+I read about this book in a catalog, I was intrigued, so I ordered a copy. The book arrived today I read through it and found it to be quite ordinary. It wasn't a smooth read. Very choppy. Not inspiring in fact it was somewhat  depressing. I was very disappointed. I will return the book to the catalog  company today for a refund. Save your money and look elsewhere for life  changing book+books
Beyond the pale!!!!+N+This book represents the greatest potential waste of your time and money imaginable.  The author clearly presents his blather from a fully leftist position and then expects the reader to swallow it as some hidden "fact".  Save your money and as importantly save your time+books
Book Condemns Hinduism without quoting any Hindu scripture. +N+Rabi Maharaj is confused about Hinduism, the "culture-religion" in which he  was born and raised. Except the part that he was  born in a Hindu family,  Rabi is totally ignorant of the concept of God  in Hinduism.     Christians worship One & Only God in three persons; Hindus worship One & Only  God in trillions of forms.  Fact of the matter is,  this concept of One & Only God, started during Rig Vedic Period in India, at least 1000 years before the birth of Hebrew civilization in the land of Cannon.   The Hindu Rig Veda 1:164:46 states " Ekam Sat Viprah Bahudha Vadanti---- "There is only One God [Truth] , but sages call that God many names".   Another ancient Hindu scripture Yajurveda 32: 2 states   "Na tasya Pratima asti" [There is no image of him]... Another Hindu scripture  Svetasvatara Upanishad 4:19  states "His form is not to be seen; no one sees Him with naked eye."    Ravi should  also know that Hindus do not  worship  icons but like everybody else use "icons" to concentrate on a God who has "no name or form."   I have a  question for  Rabi and the great apologetic, radio-TV Talk show guest  Dave Hunt.   You  quote thousands of verses from the Holy Bible, when ever you wanted to talk, preach  and write about Christianity.    So my question to you ,  " Why you failed to quote even one verse from a Hindu scripture to prove your arguments against Hinduism?   In my review, I quoted many verses from the Hindu scriptures to prove Hindus worship only ONE GOD.  Why  authors of this book failed to quote not even  one verse from a Hindu scripture to prove  their arguments?   How can you ridicule or condemn a culture/ religion like Hinduism about 1 billion people on earth practice, with out even quoting one verse from a  Hindu scripture?    Unless by writing this book their intention was to follow the foot steps of   Dr. Joseph Goebbels, Propaganada Minister of the Third Reich  who said , " Repeat a lie thousand times and it becomes the truth."  +books
No information on Cosmopolitan Doll & Toy Corp's. "Ginger" +N+Even though Kathryn Kay was mentioned as a former Vogue Doll employee, her doll "Ginger" by the Cosmopolitan Doll & Toy Corp. was not illustrated and with absolutely NO information.  This book is otherwise recommended for Vogue dolls only+books
welcome approach+P+I just like Dutch Sheets' style - not as militant as the inside cover blurbs, and yet still pressing and urgent enough to pull you in and make you think this stuff through for yourself. Good follow-up to INTERCESSORY PRAYER. And in times like these (post-09/11/2001 USAmerica, after the WTC/Pentagon attacks), we definitely need men and women in the towers, watching and alert+books
Not good enough+N+This selfpaced training is one of the worst Microsoft has produced so far. The only one that i can think of that is worse is the selfpaced training kit for IEAK 4. If you have bought it and are preparing for the MCP test. I  advice you to read the chapters in the Windows 2000 Srv RK on the subjects  for the test. Also be sure to download some whitepapers from Microsoft. The  book alone just don't prepare you good enough for the test+books
One sided+N+Yes, there are flaws in Kinsey's statistics and sometimes his methods were unethical. These two problems still exist today. But I think this book goes too far. There are no references to back up the "facts". It was written by a journalist with no credentials except that she is on a lifetime crusade to repress people's sexuality. It is published by Ascension Press, a religious publisher. Of course it is going to denounce his work. This publisher represents people who live by the bible and Kinsey's research does not follow the bible. So why does that make it wrong? I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone with a brain.+books
Tired and worn out+N+I wasn't sure if I was reading a new novel, or just re-reading one of several of the last Catherine Coulter novels I've waded through.  I think that I am truly sick of the big, strong man caring for sick, injured woman bit.  The story was dumb; there was no real mystery.  I love the &quot;Song&quot; series and most of the Sherbrooke Brides series.  This was plain disappointing+books
Anti-Zionism is anti-Semitism+N+The next time someone tells you anti-Zionism is not anti-Judaism, please cite this book. It is a total and 300 percent proof that the two phenomena are one and the same. In today's climate, Israel is the international Jew, and hating Israel amounts to hating Jews and the Jewish faith. This book proves this beyond a reasonable doubt, and the fact that it is highly placed on all Arab and Muslim anti-Israel websites is another indication of the same. Bosh and balderdash, a great huge piece of trash+books
Love this book !+P+I love this new book by Gloria Page.  The book itself is an Art Stamping project.  Each page of the book is created with hand-made graphics.  The instructions are very clear and the projects yield very wonderful results.  Try them as soon as you get the book.  You won't be disappointed+books
The author can do better.+N+I felt that the Tamara Hayle mysteries are all missing that at-the-edge-of-my-seat suspense that is required in  mysteries.  I couldn't care less about the characters, and the outcome was predictable+books
BORING+N+he gives plenty of stats and fine details    but forgets that he's talking about people.    it becomes very boring and lifeless, too     much emphasis on details and not enough on    the players behind the numbers. i recommend     &quot; baseball in 41' &quot; by robert creamer, a fine    book  something that &quot;more than merkle...&quot;    should've had more of+books
Good Catholic girls+P+This book, and the glimpse it provides into the lives of these strong  women, gives hope to the Catholic Church and to the world. It is the women who have challenged the church, called it to task for not being all that it must be, and who have yet remained faithful to the church -- or at least to the call of the Spirit -- who are and will be the agents of change that is so deperately needed in our world today. +books
Overall, a terrible book with a horrible attitude +N+Overall, this book was terrible.  I will start with the few excellent points this book made:  Many celebrities have horrendous families (3 kids from 3 different men, for example), but this is overlooked while it is practically the only thing people say about poor women (ex: "Welfare Mothers"). The chapter on Welfare Mothers had lots of good points in it-it was worth reading.   They make the point that parents are too "child-centered" now. It is true that some parents let their kids have way too much control and give them way more material goods and attention than they need. Kids don't really need much of either. However, what these authors are promoting is extremely opposite of "child-centered."   The marketing of products moms "need" is out of control. Many moms waste money on irrelevant products and really need to be aware of the marketing aimed at them to try to get them to buy tons of junk. You need to be smart about marketing, good point.   But... then.... the authors make a comment like this: "While it was certainly true that many mothers were looking for toys that were stimulating and compensated for the fact that America still had no national day care or nursery school system, the toy industry always suggested that the new marketing trends were entirely driven by mothers." That's right, it's the lack of national day care that is causing me to become rampantly materialistic! No matter what the problem, these authors will find someone/something to blame it on.   Now, to all the other things that I did not like about this book (where to start!):  The authors go on and on and on about celebrities and how they are portrayed as perfect mothers and workers. Give me a break. Women have to be smarter than to actually believe this nonsense. Please don't blame People for making you feel guilty as a mother. Celebrities are not even in the same class as the rest of us. They can't even compare their lives to ours. And, if they try, you must know it is a bunch of baloney. If you don't want to read about celebrity babies, don't buy People. Don't watch ET. It's really not hard to avoid if it affects you so much.  Although the authors think pointing to a few isolated daycare incidents is no evidence of problems with childcare (they vehemently defend daycares, even ones that are investigated for crimes against children), they seem eager to make a point that a few other isolated cases- Andrea Yates, Susan Smith, babies in dumpsters- is obviously calling attention to a problem with the new "momism." This is the scapegoat for these women who killed their children. No matter what your parenting problem, the authors have an excuse for you!    "Dumb Men, Stupid Choices- Or Why We Have No Childcare:" The authors open with a description of a WWII daycare center. The few that were actually like this were open 24 hours and did your laundry and grocery shopping while you worked, along with meal prep, and taking care of sick children in a special place in the center (which were no doubt this nice because they were a temporary solution for women called from home to do their civic duty). The authors are saying this is what it should be like today......   So then the authors go on to bash everyone who doesn't agree with their childcare position. Then they bring out this stat: "By 1995, 75 percent of kids under five were regularly watched by someone other than their parents." They are implying that 75% of women out there need/want government daycare centers. First of all, that statistic is ridiculous. The 75% stat includes part-time moms (which are about ½ of the 75%). Some of these moms work very few hours, other do "split shifts" with their spouse so their children don't have to go to daycare. Many part-time kids are playing with grandma or auntie and cousins. I really doubt these kids would rather be in big, govt. daycare. Now, of the roughly 37% of moms working full-time, the percentage that have to work to make ends meet is very small. If you also look at the preferences of poor women who have to work, they overwhelmingly like home based and relative care for their children-not huge govt. daycare. They also overwhelmingly, if given a choice, would rather stay home and raise their own children. So, the authors of this book are pushing for a childcare system, of enormous cost, that is the least popular option and will serve a minority of working mothers.   Then this comment, "Many young mothers who need a salary-and, frankly, time away from the kids-feel they have no choice but to quit their jobs, either for the sake of the kids, or because they simply can't afford the childcare near them." Are these authors suggesting that the taxpayers pick up the bill for moms who want to get out of the house and work for fun? It sure sounds like it!   The authors act like there are no honest women out there who enjoy motherhood. The authors are clearly blinded by their own feelings. I'm really not sure why women like these authors feel a calling to publish books trying to convince the public that happy, fulfilled mothers are a "myth." It's not.  In the chapter: "Dr. Laura's Neighborhood" (and in the rest of this book) we learn that if you are a: man, home-schooling mom (except a few minority who the authors think are OK), attachment parenting mom, Christian, conservative, someone who likes organically grown food, happy mother, a member of the "Greatest Generation," someone who likes decorating, pro-life, breastfeeding mom, mother of multiple babies (they especially like to attack you if you used fertility drugs) or a SAHM-you are NOT approved by these authors!   These authors are pompous and arrogant, thinking they are the be-all-end-all to judge others. These women are clearly driven by some irrational rage against all other mothers who are not exactly like them. The women who wrote this book are the type that will sneer at you in Traget because your child is crying or having a tantrum. They are the types who would turn the other way and let the door slam in your face when you are trying to get your stroller out an non-automatic door. And watch out if you are on their "most hated" list because you would get the extra-extra dirty look. This book reads like a nasty note you would find on the floor of a high school, written by a girl who is jealous of the girls in another clique.  +books
Often overlooked Masterpiece+P+Read this to understand Sting's "Tea in the Sahara" reference for the first time, and to your very core.  (We're all looking for the tallest sand dune--the place with the optimal vantage point--and we often lose our way in deserts of our own making.)  What an amazing book.  I'm so glad I believed Gore Vidal's cover blurb about Bowles' art far exceeding that of other contemporary American writers.  Really, Vidal says it best: "Bowles has glimpsed what lies back of our sheltering sky...an endless flux of stars so like those atoms which make us up that we experience not only horror but likeness." Beg, borrow, or buy at least a cheap paperback version: if you don't read The Sheltering Sky, you're missing out on greatness+books
An excellent book about my homeland+P+I've lived in China since 1999, and I often read stories about China in the Western media that I simply don't believe. Others report on abuses that do occur here without giving a reader any understanding of why. So, China remains "inscrutable." (I'm rolling my eyes...)  China is a complex subject. How can a Westerner who has never been here know what's happening? China is so far away and shrouded in a bit of mystery, some due to the sheer length of its history and some due to the power of the Party. In my case, I don't speak Chinese, so getting past the public face is impossible.  Ian Johnson of the Wall Street Journal won a Pulitzer Prize for his reporting on China. He speaks the language. And, he's one heck of a fine journalist. In WILD GRASS, he recounts the stories of three ordinary Chinese citizens who find themselves fighting the repression of the system, risking imprisonment and even death.  Johnson understands "the big picture," and after reading this book, so will you. A nation is not just a single entity. It's made of people. All nations, not just the one you live in. So what are the people in China like? Read this book, and you'll feel like you've met some of them. A peasant lawyer, a young architectural student, a bereaved daughter. Poor farmers in Yulin and Party officials in Beijing.  Johnson also brings the scenery to life, makes the unfamiliar familiar, and captures many little details and episodes and ironies. A compelling subject in the hands of a masterful author.  China is experiencing unprecented economic development. What effect will this ultimately have on its social and political system? I don't agree with all of the author's conclusions -- it surprises me how much I agree with the Party -- but it doesn't matter. That's part of the beauty of this book. To bandy about phrases like "evil empire" is the simplistic idiocy that will (I hope) eventually doom morons like Dubya. Can we please move past that and try to genuinely understand?  There can be no doubt that what Johnson reports in this book is factually accurate. If you want to learn about China, this is a good place to start. And then, form your own conclusions. There's plenty of room for you to do that here. Which, in the end, is what journalism is all about.  I'm quite glad that I read this book. This is literature, same as George Orwell, who I also don't always agree with. And agreement does not matter. Spurring a reader to think is what matters. Johnson can do that with the best of them.+books
An illuminating peek inside the Corps' "closet"+P+In "The Masculine Marine: Homoeroticism in the U.S. Marine Corps," author Steven Zeeland offers a compelling alternate view of one of the United States' most revered and recognizable institutions.  An "About the Author" note identifies Zeeland as a Research Associate at the Center for Research and Education in Sexuality at San Francisco State University.  The heart of the book is a series of revealing interviews that Zeeland conducted with several Marines.  His interviewees include both gay and straight men, and one woman Marine; he also includes both officers and enlisted men.  Particularly interesting is an interview with a gay Black Navy officer who previously had been an enlisted Marine and who, at the time of the interview, was involved in an interracial relationship with a Marine corporal.  Among the many themes covered in the book are Marine tattoos, the "gays-in-the-shower" issue, Marine attitudes about physical fitness and body image, the role of women Marines in the Corps, boot camp experiences, the "selling" of the Corps through advertising, gay relationships, the "coming out" experience, defining masculinity, and the parallel between Marine self-presentation and that of drag queens.  A particularly important theme is the unique reputation and mystique of the Corps; in his introduction, Zeeland notes that "Marineness is like a religion."  Specific male-on-male sex practices engaged in by Marines are frankly discussed and provocatively analyzed. The book also looks at homoerotic rituals and language of the Corps.  The historical backdrop for the book includes the Gulf War, U.S. intervention in Somalia, and the beginning of the Clinton presidency.  The consistently compelling text is complemented by a sixteen-page visual section which explores Marine tattoos, haircuts, physiques, and dress.  There are photographs from the Athletic Model Guild and other sources.  A particularly interesting part of the visual supplement is a 12-panel comic by Jerry Mills entitled "Poppers"; this ironic, richly detailed piece is essentially a complete short story in comic form.  The book is full of fascinating anecdotes and observations, both from Zeeland and his interviewees.  Although Zeeland is doing a serious scholarly project, complete with end notes, he makes no pretense at scholarly detachment.  He notes in his prologue that his research technique involves befriending servicemen--"sometimes in an intimate way."  He is sort of like an extreme Jane Goodall, passionately connected to the objects of his study.  At times his writing and interview questions struck me as too self-indulgent, but in the end he has produced a human document that is both informative and profoundly moving.  The book interrogates iconography, challenges stereotypes, and gives gay Marines a space to tell their first-person stories.  For a companion text, I recommend "Generation Kill," an account of Marines in the Iraq War written by embedded reporter Evan Wright.  Wright documents some startling examples of Marine homoeroticism; he even quotes one Marine as saying, "Man, the Marines are so homoerotic.  That's all we talk about."  Like Wright, Zeeland has produced a truly remarkable contribution to Marine Corps literature+books
About the &quot;Lesbian Nation&quot;+P+When I first read this book I became fascinate with the story, the  characters seems to be very representative of the so call &quot;Lesbian  Nation&quot; about the sisters and queers. Also establish the  transformation suffer by the lesbian &quot;type&quot; between the decades  of 1960, 1970,1980 and 1990+books
Nice Intro...+N+The best part about this book was the intro.  In fact all you need to understand what the late Mr. Bloom was trying to put forth is in the introduction.  The rest of the book is  a chore to read.  The confusing and tedious writing  style leads to a lot of re-reading of sentences to figure out the point the author is trying to make.  Someone should have counseled Mr. Bloom that "Brevity is the soul of wit." +books
Fine tension and mystery evolve slowly and grippingly+P+Agatha Christie's Death In The Clouds comes to life under Hugh Fraser's experienced voice: his past experiences bring other Hercule Poirot mysteries in the series to life lends a uniformity of experience and sound to this latest. The sudden death of a female passenger on an intercontinental plane flight involves investigator Hercule Poirot in a search for the culprit - even when the investigation seems to point to Poirot as the possible perp. Fine tension and mystery evolve slowly and grippingly+books
One of the most entertaining books in the series so far+P+This installment, like the rest of this series so far, is suspenseful, funny and populated with characters that seem very real.  One new character, Laura Fielding, is admirably faithful to her imprisoned husband, and is, in general, a very likable character (and one that charms both Stephen and Jack).  The Middle Eastern setting of this book is exotic and very vividly described.  Stephen's adventures in his new scientific marvel, the diving bell, are both funny and interesting.  Jack's encounters with Laura's massive dog Ponto are hilarious.  The end of this book is very suspenseful because the reader has come to really care about the characters involved.  The most notable thing about this book is what a great job O'Brian did of keeping this series fresh by bringing in new locations, characters and situations.  O'brian did a great job of not letting this series fall into predictable formulas and repetition.  The only failing of this book is that the very end is just a little disappointing and O'brian leaves the reader hanging much more than in the previous books+books
Caution when ordering this workbook!+N+I had purchased this workbook intending to use it to help study for the PMP Exam.  Although the workbook does contain over 300 pages of sample  questions that might be helpful in studying for the exam, it does NOT  include answers to any of the questions.  Therefore, there is no way to  verify that you've answered the questions correctly, which made the  workbook of very little value to me.  I decided to return it to Amazon  unused+books
Not an easy read, but worth it+P+This novel was difficult for me to get into.  The noir speak of the book presented itself as a barrier to entry.  After training myself to think in terms of the language, I found myself so engrossed in the story that I moved through it at a steady pace.  Definitely a darker novel but the character development was outstanding+books
Not Technical Enough+N+This book is heavy on jargon and vendor provided information - it is essentially a collection of articles from Computer Telephony magazine, without much editing or organization.  It lacks technical depth and is poorly organized for researching information, e.g., its index is essentially a word occurance listing+books
changing the story of our lives+P+what DO we think and believe about ourselves, our place in the world, and the world around us? we have the beliefs, they influence us in more ways every day than we probably realize, but rarely take a look at what they really are. this book is an exploration into the mythology of individuals, complete with exercises and methodologies. if you really want to know and are ready to look, and as a result change and free yourself from old unconscious beliefs, this book might well be a great place to start.+books
Boring!+N+I lent this book to my MIL before I read it but told her not to tell me about it or her thoughts on it until after I read it. I couldn't get passed the 2nd chapter. I found myself skipping pages that soon. I asked her if she liked it and she said she skipped a lot of pages also and found it to be very repetitive and boring. In my honest opinion it is one of the most boring books I have picked up. It just reads BORING!+books
A Real Classic+P+When I was growing up, my Mother told me that she had been given this book by a beau, had read it and enjoyed it. This was in the early 1900s! When I saw it in a used Book Store about a year ago, I picked it up. I am just now  reading it. I was totally surprised to find that it is beautifully written, presents a wonderful picture of a vanished time and people and is funny. I find myself smiling at the phrases that have become cliches - &quot;When you call me that smile.&quot; and at the fact that I am getting as much pleasure from reading it as my Mother did all those years ago+books
I bought this book used for $1.50 and regret it+N+First, the content is not well-organized.  TV programs and TV memories are generational, so it doesn't make sense to mix images from the 50s-90s together.    Second, the photographs have little impact.  The book itself is rather small, and some pages contain clusters of small photos that compete for your attention.  Third, there is little interesting commentary.  A good nostalgia book should describe how pop culture and society influenced each other.  This little book doesn't begin to do justice to the most powerful medium of our age+books
The Definitive Magic Flute+P+I'm usually dismissive of most Die Zauberflotes because I find the overall quality of the singers and recording lacking.  Then I came upon this recording...I have to say that it is simply the most amazing Die Zauberflote I've ever heard!  The orchestrations to the singers to the conductor himself...everything is mind-blowing!  I'm not a Mozart person, but if I really like a recording of his I will buy it.  This is an excellent way to introduce yourself to the Flute, especially since there is such a wonderful introduction accompanying this extremely famous opera.  And the Queen of the Night-Edda Moser!!!  Amazing!  Simply amazing!  No other Queen has conveyed that much drama into her singing.  This is the Flute.  I would suggest Marriner's version if I hadn't seen this one, but then here is a Flute with all the greats in it!  Get it now+books
A wonderful reference+P+I really enjoy using this book.  My 29 year old gelding has found new vigor from the suggested herbs, and my son's 2 year old mare is in peak condition thanks to black oil sunflower seeds and other recommendations.  I recommend this book to anyone with horses who's interested in helping them to stay happy and healthy into old age+books
Pretty but useless+N+It looks cute (like Martha Stewart's magazines) but did not contain one usefull piece of advice.  Since most of us only do this once, there is not too much personal experience to draw from.  Therefore we look to the professionals for ideas, sample wording and help.  This was total waste of time unless I was going to have each invitation hand written or tied with a rhinestone buckle+books
Tatterhood Rides Again!+P+I remembered this collection of world tales from my own youth and was pleased that it was just as vibrant and fun as I remembered.  Although the tales center around female protagonists, children and adults of any gender can enjoy the action, wit, and surprising tales featured here. +books
Great gift for a aspiring guitarist.+P+I'm no musician, but I bought this and the CD containing these songs for my brother, who has been learning to play many old standards from the 60s, 70s, and 80s.  He thought it was a great Christmas gift; he's really enjoying it!+books

Great book+P+This was a great addition to the series. I love the way Anne Bishop writes I could read her books over and over. The book had a great blend of humor and suspense. I wanted more storyline on some of the characters but the book seemed to drop them. Ari was not in this book much which was too bad, I like her character. The book left an opening for another book or a spinoff. If there is no plan to write another book I will be disappointed because there are some characters I would like to follow up on+books
A cherished read+P+By reading this book I began to admire Bobby Jones, not so much for his golf but for his character and his strength in making it to the end.  It would have been a lot easier for him in a folklore sense if he had died young instead of being tortured with a crippling, painful disease that challenged him physically and was a test to him mentally and emotionally.  I admire that he never hid himself away like so many famous people do that want to be remembered as they "were".  I believe that this is the most admirable thing about him.  That and his willingness to serve in WWII, landing on the same beach the day after D-Day.  Not just a "for show" tour of duty.  His devotion to his family, his country and his friends and his hometown are quite amazing.  He is a role model in many ways that I don't even think of golf as one of them but for his tenaciousness, his intellect, his well roundedness and his extreme graciousness.  He could have derailed many times but he never did in life.  It's a loss that there isn't more to read about his life to know how he managed to adjust to everyday life and his illness, how he kept putting one foot in front of the other.  The criticism seems unjust re: Chick Evans, Jones was very kind in all his correspondence to him which I have read in other books.  Also, so much is made of his temper which he defends and explains in "Down the Fairway" by Jones, as not worse than any other player of the time and shortlived as a childish display that was never witnessed again at least publically for the rest of his life.  Bobby Jones accomplished an amazing number of feats that most of us would feel proud to do even one of such as the many languages he spoke, the degrees, his many intellectual skills, a good family man and most of all his grace in a life+books
Words of Wisdom from TV?  Amazing!+P+This is a fun little book chock full of wise sayings gleaned from episodes of the original Star Trek.  The original was not a space opera, it was a futurized series of life's lessons, very carefully crafted.  Each episode had a heavy-duty message embedded within--and not very hard to spot either.  This book does not necessarily include these thematic messages, but it does excerpt a number of pithy, humorous quotes from the characters.  It is highly reminiscent of a poster my dentist has in his office of Everything I Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten.  I expect there is also a book with that name, but I haven't read it.  These words of wisdom also remind me of Dr. Akin's famous "Laws of Spacecraft Design" which you can access on the internet.  With his permission, I used several in my book "The Knowledge Management and Information Technology Encyclopedia" (published by the Government and not for sale).  My favorite submits from Marinaccio's delightful book are:   Gossip is often confused with conversation.  In fact it often takes the place of conversation.  Take gossip away from some folks and they would turn into mimes.  p.61  When everyone is responsible, ultimately no one is responsible.  p.52  Idiot-proofing is also genius-proofing. p.94  Great people talk about ideas.  Average people talk about things.  Small people talk about people.  p.61  Attitude is the top priority; after attitude, talent or gifts are important.  p.64  As Yogi Berra, the great Yankees catcher, once said, "You can observe a lot, just by watching."  p.23  A person who understands a rule knows when to break it.  p.50  Competent people know which rules to follow and which to ignore ... when people of good judgement are allowed to exercise their insights, good results usually follow.  When people=s hands are tied, they are ineffective.  p.94  The more complex the mind, the greater the need for the simplicity of play.  pp. 8, 53, & 54  Difficult choices expose how we truly feel.  What we believe deep inside.  p.39  The most important time to help someone is when they need it.  p.8  For man, Utopia is endless challenge.  p.1+books
The best one+P+I'm a brazilian doctorean student in Supply Chain Management, and this book is being very important for my studies. It is about the risk end vulnerability that one enterprise can occours, and show examples and tools to use when a disruption occours. Very good+books
Kind of neat...+P+Very, very interesting. I found this book by way of another pet communicator who, after doing a reading on my pets, recommended this book. I can't say I learned how to communicate telepathically with my pets,  but... hmmm... What Penelope Smith says makes sense: quiet mind is the  first step for so many other things, from good health to artistic creation  to, yes, it certainly seems possible, telepathically communicating with  animals. The trouble is, sorting out the junk from genuine communication.  So, in all, so far, I haven't gotten all that much from this book. But I'm  very glad Penelope Smith wrote it. I know I will come back and re-read it+books
Don't just know Lincoln, understand him.+P+I've read many titles on Lincoln and have come to know the man, his words and his deeds. But now I can say that I understand him. American revisionists have lately found it fashionable and all too easy to knock  down our heroes and charge them with crimes from the perspective of the   Twentieth Century. Yet, Boritt's insights are a wonderful celebration of a  true American hero. And better yet, Boritt makes no apologies for it.   Perhaps we needed to wait for this foreign born author to remind us what  has been really important about the USA all along. Wrap yourself in the   red, white and blue and feel patriotic again. Oh, and by the way, don't let  the title scare you. The book is quite an easy read+books

Janette Oke...+P+Janette Oke in this book is wonderful. She places infront of me the examples I need to know. All of us need to know. most people in this world today would not be such wonderful examples. I do not know of many myself. Showing me the way to see the positive in the negative, I find that this is a very special book, indeed+books
Lots of information but not enough pictures+N+I enjoy reading, but I am a very visual person and was disappointed in this book because while it offers suggestions that make sense, it takes longer to get through the book since it is practically all words and very  few pictures for inspiration+books
A Rather Negative Look at Motherhood+N+I've read lots of pregnancy books, and this book came recommended as an "honest" view.  It may be honest, but very negative! I realize that motherhood isn't usually the fairytale many of us hope it will be, but this book just dwelled on the negatives: sometimes you can't figure out breastfeeding, sometimes you worry that your husband might leave you, sometimes the baby won't stop crying.... Hopefully there are more books out there that are more evenly balanced with "real life" stories.  I recommend that you keep looking+books
dated, not much good info+N+I bought this book for ideas and best practices. I work in retail design. The quality of the printing of the book was not very good; photos didn't give much of a sense of scale, materials used. And the examples seemed very dated to me.  If you are a retail design professional, you are better off heading to a local mall, taking some notes and pics yourself+books
One of the best!+P+First of all, I'm not Jeannine; I'm her husband-she bought the book for me.  I have been wanting to build a guitar (and bass) for a very long time, and have been gathering information from a variety of sources. But this book covers it all as far as construction goes, and its not too bad on the finishing side of things. It covers 3 different types of neck construction, and flat top and carved top bodys. Definately money well spent+books
American Zen Begins+P+Brad Warner is truly an inspiring young man.  I have read his book, recommend it to others; met him, recommend him to others, and wonder how long the cobwebs will remain in American Zendos with this book flying around. Zen is a lived and envolving experience.  Warner shows us how we can take a culture and integrate it with another, finding value in each, yet creating a new culture in the process.  Zen is icoloclastic reverence.  On the floor are pieces of the trappings of Zen.  The Zen remain and is vibrant as a result.    The best recommendation? My daughter, the Ph.D. scientist, loved it. So Daiho-rosh+books
Invaluable+P+I am so grateful for this book and to Barbara Feldon to write it for us.  It prepared me for the holidays and how to plan for them so I could get through them. I am thankful that she helped me avoid pitfalls during vacations. And her clear and simple direction about designing my financial independence put me on the right track. Her wonderful hints how to have nice highlights with people with whom we interact all the time is making my daily life filled with kindness and friendly smiles. I still refer to her book all the time when I need to remind myself to be kind to myself and when the solo life gets rough sometimes. It is a must-have+books
One of the Marketing Classics!+P+For an student or practitioner of adverstising and marketing, this is a "must read" and a personal library staple. Yes, the examples may be dated, but the concepts are still operable. You should read their "Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind" first. Though based on Von Clauswitz (set piece warfare), there is much to be learned. Include Sun Tzu The Art of War in your library as well.  Not that I have an opinion+books
Excellent arguments from a brilliant writer+P+Walter E. Williams is extremely gifted in his ability to present an argument.  In More Liberty Means Less Government, Williams presents short articles that he has written (ranging from 1995 - 1997), each of these articles is a beautifully orchestrated example of the perfect argument from start to finish.  Not only does Williams present a convincing argument for each topic, but he adjusts his balance of pathos, ethos, and logos depending on the topic he asses.  When discussing many potentially controversial topics such as school vouchers or education reform, Williams first seeks to establish himself as a credible source on the topic, and frequently brings in more than one real life source on the topic.  William's doesn't just quote some professor's work on education, he refers to the owner of a small private school in his area and HER opinion on how to solve the problem of our dismal education schools.  Due to his brilliance of mind and communication, Williams is incredibly effective in presenting his political agenda, and creates a masterpiece in More Liberty Means Less Government+books
Very useful reference.+P+This is one of those books that every beginner needs. It starts with the simplest characters with the least amount of strokes and builds on those simple characters to more complex ones. I like the book. I'm an ABC and I find it a useful reference as I am beginning to learn and add more characters to my database.  In reference to the other review which is warning people to steer clear of this book; traditional chinese is very useful to know. It is after all the original language that is closest to Medieval Chinese and is the writing which all simplified chinese writing is based. Although, Hong Kong and Taiwan will be switching over to the simplified forms of writing in the next few years, I don't believe that means traditional characters will disappear.+books

This does more than just hurt! It's truly painful!+N+"Blind Alley" is the fifth novel in the continuing story of Eve Duncan, forensic sculptor, Joe Quinn, Atlanta police detective and Jane MacGuire, their precocious seventeen year old adopted daughter rescued from the streets. Be warned that much of this review might be construed as spoilers but I'm betting that it's not going to matter much since you'll likely be giving the book a pass anyway!   I used to treat Iris Johansen as a sure thing! You know what I mean - the kind of author whose new title you'd add to your reading list without even caring what the plot line was or you'd pick up a copy at the store without even bothering to flip open the dust jacket for a peek! "Blind Alley" buried that thought - cold, deep and fast! It was a great deal more than just bad - it was truly painful!   A shadowy serial killer named Aldo is on the loose slaughtering women in a most unseemly, gruesome fashion. Carving their living faces right off their skulls, Aldo imagines himself responsible for the systematic elimination of all women who resemble Cira, a courtesan/actress/prostitute killed two thousand years ago in the town of Herculaneum when Vesuvius erupted. It would seem that Aldo is a little upset at having lost the love and attention of his father, an archeologist who became obsessed with Cira when he discovered her statue and some details of her life.   As if that isn't deep enough in left field as the premise for a thriller, imagine the eyebrows you'll raise when you read that Jane MacGuire, Eve Duncan and Joe Quinn's adopted 17 year old daughter is a ringer for Cira. Not only does she find herself stalked by Aldo but some inexplicable psychological attachment to Cira plagues Jane with regular nightmares in which she is trapped in caves or tunnels fleeing for her life from the eruption of Vesuvius.   It doesn't end there - Johansen tosses Mark Trevor into the mix. He's a con and an antiquities smuggler (picture Lovejoy with a nasty streak!) who had a run-in with Aldo and is intent on killing him. To that end he intrudes himself into Eve Duncan's and Joe Quinn's life and sets himself up as Jane's protector. Now, I'm no prude but the scene in which Trevor, a grown man at least as old as Joe, has a near sexual encounter with Jane, a typical seventeen year old teenager with respect to her hormones and sexuality, is just plain distasteful and, frankly, scored well into the red zone on the "yuk" meter!   There is just so much wrong with this novel, it's difficult to know where to begin and where to stop - nightmares that start, happen and end with no explanation or psychological development at all; unlike any previous Johansen novel I've read, the characters and dialogue seem trite, wooden and completely contrived; the outcome of Mark Trevor as a character is left spectacularly un-resolved; Eve Duncan's obsession with her murdered daughter, Bonnie, continues unabated and is definitely becoming downright irritating; a wonderful sub-plot concerning Eve's forensic reconstruction of a real skull from the Vesuvius eruption was simply deep-sixed!   I still own a few Johansen titles that I haven't read so there is perhaps hope. But she'll have to prove to me that she hasn't jumped the shark before I'll spend another cent on a new title!   Paul Weiss+books
self-important+N+I don't understand why this book has the ratings of the other reviews here. It is a big disappointment. While this book has some interesting tips between the lines (that's why I give it 2 stars instead of one), it is merely a rambling of a self-important producer. The 303 "solutions" are at best 303 anecdotal stories. Take solution #96 "How to Shoot in a Boat" for example, it reads, in its entirety "I always seem to get the jobs of shooting from some kind of moving vehicle. You've read my exploits in the air and on the ground, but what about in the water? Shooting footage from a boat is a skill that someday I will master. Not wanting to delve into jet skis, Ski-Dos, or speedboats, I will be discussing motorboats and sailboats." Great solution Chuck! That really makes my filming much better. Perhaps it would be possible to cut down this book into 99 tips and solutions, but in the style its been written it would still be painful to read and extract useful information. Furthermore, the cover says, "solve any video or edit problem in 10 minutes or less". Not only is that untrue but also shows how silly this book is. The picture of a consumer DV camera also has nothing to do with the content, because Chuck uses big professional equipment throughout this book, stuff that takes more than 10 minutes to just unpack by the way. I haven't found a good book to suggest as an alternative yet, but don't waste your money on this one. Try any other+books

Too Complex+N+I purhcased this book because I am intersted in world religions, especially those with elements of mysticism.  I have often heard references to the Kabbalah and I wanted to learn more about its contents.  I am a college student majoring in biology, psychology, and history, and my desire to study the Kabbalah stems not from required coursework but rather from personal interest.  If I were pursuing a degree in religious studies, or had I been repeatedly exposed to the concepts that Scholem discussed, I would have been fine.  However, it is nearly impossible for a layman to understand the subject matter as presented by Scholem.  There is simply too much jargon and Scholem's writing style makes me wonder as if he tried to make things overly complex to divulge his brilliance.    If you are an experienced religious scholar, most likely this book will be excellent.  However, if you're a layman who is attempting to get a feel for the basic concepts and principles of Jewish Mysticism, this book will only frustrate you because it's too advanced+books
The truth+P+Alot of reviews are saying the Edgar Rice Burroughs did not actually write "John Carter and the Giant of Mars".  The truth is that he did.  This is what happened and what causes confusion: a childrens publisher wanted a short version of a Edgar Rice Burroughs' novel.  Mr. Burroughs was concerned that he could not keep it short enough for the publisher so he asked his son to help craft a shorter story.  At the same time, Amazing Stories asked Edgar Rice Burroughs for another Mars novel.  A full lenght one to serialize.  Edgar took the short story and stretched it to a full novel.  This is confirmed by several sources and by Edgar Rice Burroughs estate.  It explains why some of the novel strays from the rest of the series.  So, yes his son was involved, but it is wrong to say that Edgar Rice Burroughs did not write it. He did.  Especially the novel version.  Anyway, all of the Mars books are exciting and I recomend all the books in the series+books
Disappointing +N+If you are familiar with modular knitting, this book offers nothing new.  The patterns didn't appeal to me at all;  there was no snap to the designs.  If you aren't familiar with modular knitting, there are better books from which to learn+books
"I've already told you that I believe in nothing."+P+Ivan Turgenev's novel "Fathers and Sons" examines the emerging generation gap that reflects the growing changes in 19th century Russian society. When the novel begins middle-aged widower Nikolai Petrovich Kirasnov is waiting for the return of his son Arkady. Arkady, who has just graduated from university, returns with his close friend the nihilist, medical student Bazarov. Bazarov is the son of a retired army doctor, and he comes from a humble, yet vital background. While Bazarov embodies the ideals of nihilism, Arkady's belief system seems to be a pale reflection of his friend's. Arkady's foppish effete uncle, Pavel, a former army officer, is deeply disturbed by Bazarov, and sees Bazarov and his belief system as a personal affront.   The novel begins in 1859--right before the emancipation of the serfs in 1861--and a significant shift is taking place in Russian society. The relatively enlightened Kirasnov has freed his serfs, and he's attempting to adjust to employing people who can produce. The management of his estate, however, is problematic. Kirasnov has an illegitimate child with a peasant girl he refuses to marry because of the differences in their social status, and the girl, Fenichka and her child live in one of the back rooms of the house. Fenichka's role is a peculiar one--she's obviously Kirasnov's mistress, but she's also a servant within the household.   Kirasnov and his brother Pavel are "men of the old school"--whereas Bazarov and to a lesser degree Arkady represent the new wave of thought--Nihilism. Bazarov "does not look up to any authorities ... does not accept a single principle on faith, no matter how highly that principle may be esteemed." Both Bazarov and Arkady find their nihilist beliefs under assault when they fall in love. Bazarov, who believes that the "study of personalities is a waste of time" and that "all people are alike" finds himself inexplicably falling in love with the elegant, cold, elusive widow Anna Odintsova. While Anna is immensely attracted to Bazarov, she cannot allow herself to engage in any passionate affair. He threatens her passionless, ordered world, and she threatens his nihilist beliefs. But falling in love is just the first of Bazarov's problems. He also discovers that prolonged exposure to the Kirasnov family is a contaminating influence, and he tells Arkady, "that's what comes of living with feudal lords. You'll become a feudal lord yourself, before you know it, and take part in knightly tournaments."   Bazarov is a marvelous, strange and unforgettable character, and "Fathers and Sons"--one of the seminal novels from the period--is a must for Russophiles. As a companion piece, I recommend "Nihilist Girl" by Sofya Kovalevskaya--displacedhuma+books
Same rah rah stuff+N+I received a promotional copy in the mail, and I thank the author for that, since I didn't waste any money on it.  This is a truly unoriginal book. After reading the first few pages, I could see where it was going. I scribbled a few ideas on a piece of paper and started flipping forward through the book. Sure enough, he hit every one, and not much else.   This is another rehashing of every rah-rah book you've read on sales, and there are many hundreds of them. I've read several dozen of them, and they all sound the same after a while. The real problem with a book like this is that there might actually be something new in here, but I'd never want to spend the time reading to find it.  Typical sections: You Gotta...visualize success You Gotta...think like a winner You Gotta...sell yourself You Gotta...go the extra mile You Gotta...use the power of numbers  You Gotta...do better than this to sell this book+books

Great book for a beginning bender!+P+I purchased this book because I was interested in getting into circuit bending to create my own new instruments to use in tandem with our laptop-driven experimental music project.  This book is great, even if you're not already an electronics geek.  Very simple and direct.  Also, Reed Ghazala has a totally appreciable geeky sense of humour.  I was laughing out loud as I was learning.  I recommend this book strongly to anyone interested in getting into circuit bending. +books
Simply Awful+N+This book could quite possibly be the most poorly-written book that I have ever read.  The most glaring flaw is that the last approximately 40 pages are completely irrelevant compared with the rest of the book.  Since the book is only 200 pages long, this is quite a tangent for the author to take.  Within this section, the narrator descends into a self-pitying diary of his early adult years.  I would like to point out that the plot of the book originally centered around his last year of high school.  Past this, the rest of the book suffers from a lack of development.  Many new characters and conflicts are introduced, only to disappear in the next chapter.  The main character never develops, and the reader does not have the ability to empathize with his internal struggles.  The book simply does not have redeeming qualities, and even takes a few moments to trash Ayn Rand; since this is a book that young adults will probably read, it prevents them from forming and informed opinion about that author, controversial as she is.  I was surprised and disappointed that this book was nominated for the Pen/Faulkner award.  I strongly suggest that inquisitive readers look elsewhere for even mediocre reading material. 0 stars+books
A good book for all grade levels+P+I bought this book based on the reviews I had seen on Amazon. I was hoping that it would be a book that was chock full of ideas for my Kindergarten classroom. I have gotten a few ideas, but it seemed to really focus more on grades 2-3+books

Very Mysterious!+P+Dr. Alex Delaware is invited to take a job on the island of Aruk, by the mysterious Dr.Moreland. Shortly into his assigned tasks, Alex discovers some very odd cases that the mysterious Dr. has treated in the past. One of these cases was a man who claims to have seen "worm people". As Dr. Delaware tries to unravel these mysterious cases, a brutal murder occurs on the island of Aruk. Alex inquires of Dr. Moreland about the islands history, and Dr. Moreland is very vague in his response. As the climax of this novel approaches, Alex finds cryptic messages left for him by the then missing Dr. Moreland.  Robin is very much a main character in this story. However, if you are a big fan of Milo (as I am ), you may be dissapointed because his character plays a minor part in this novel. I give this story 4 stars, because it is not one of my favorite Kellerman stories. I thought the ending was a little silly+books
Tragic but Fascinating+P+This book, which is basically the memoirs of a young German soldier fighting in Russia during WWII, was tragic but fascinating. The language that young Willy Reese is beautiful and gripping. The young man who wrote this, in other words, was a prolific writer. He used captivating language and an unbridled vocabulary. His metaphors and allusions where breath taking and you never got bored from the raw detail that he used to describe the horrors of war. And with this book you also gain an unparalleled account of the horror and wickedness of fighting in the Eastern Front. I would recommend this book if you like WWII history or if you like to read a pseudo-prose poem and memoir with outstanding and fantastic language+books
Very good expose+P+Randi does a good job exposing Geller. The only problem is that sometimes Randi doesn't go all the way and reveal the magic trick for fear of giving away magician's secrets. This book is out of print, since no one pays attention to Geller anymore (partly due to Randi's efforts).  Having said that, I would also like to point out that Randi isn't always fair in his tests of psychics. I'm not endorsing psychics mind you, I just think Randi should give credit when it's due. For instance, when Randi was on the "Ron and Ron" radio show on WYNF in 1995(?), he asked psychic Gary Spivey what he would be doing on Wed. night. Spivey correctly guessed Randi would be flying on an airplane, to which Randi, who was obviously flustered, spat and sputtered and finally said "Well, anyone could have guessed that!" Later, host Ron Bennington pointed out, if "anyone" could have guessed, why did Randi ask it in the first place? Randi should have just laughed it off and said "OK, let's see you do that again!"   So, how do I know Randi is right about Geller? When faced with the alternative of Uri Geller being given psychic powers by aliens or using magic tricks, I would take magic tricks as an eplanation.+books
Reading Theory Isn't Supposed to Be This Fun, Is It?+P+For those who enjoy the challenge of reading high theory but are put off by the dry, abstract, pretentious ramblings that more often than not constitute theoretical writing, Zizek is the theorist for you.  Is there another theorist alive who can on one page explicate the finer points of Lacan, Hegel and Kant, while on the next page tie it all in with the three most popular female pubic hair styles, homosexual ; and subtle distinctions among toilet designs in Germany, France, and the United States?  Perhaps. But Zizek makes these seemingly awkward transitions and uncommon examples quite smoothly; the outrageous examples aren't forced, nor are they merely for &quot;shock&quot; value.  In short, they work to clarify the difficult concepts he is discussing.  Although Zizek is not what I'd call an easy read - not by a long shot - he certainly knows how to make a challenge a bit less stressful and - gasp! - fun.  EN+books
Yes, Read the whole thing!+N+I don't see how you can isolate "The Grand Inquisitor" chapter from the novel in which it is situated, The Brothers Karamazov.  I think that knowing who is telling the story, who he is telling the story too, what the story means to each of these people, and what the consequences of what the Grand Inquisitor have to say, are ALL important; important because it is a great novel and important in understanding the grand inquisitor!!!!!!!  My suggestion: Buy The Brothers Karamazov instead of this.  It's excellent+books

Courtesy of Teens Read Too+P+When eleven-year-old Art Mumby finds out that a visitor is arriving at his run-down home, Larklight, which floats in space beyond the moon, he hardly expects to be thrust into a frightening adventure of pirates, plates, and a millenium-long conflict upon which the fate of the solar system rests.  He tells the story of this adventure in LARKLIGHT (occasionally giving his older sister, Myrtle, a chance to narrate via her diary), and the story is nothing if not fantastic.  Philip Reeve (author of the HUNGRY CITY CHRONICLES) has created another fascinating world in LARKLIGHT.  Art lives in the Victorian society of the 1800's--or rather, what Victorian society would have looked like if they'd developed space travel, and astronomy worked according to early speculations about aether (an air-like substance in space that people  can move and breathe in), and interplanetary beings (Venus, Mars, and the moons of Jupiter are all home to a variety of life forms).  Reeve cuts no corners, painting the cities and citizens of the solar system in dazzling detail.  The setting is a gorgeous mix of fantasy and science fiction, and fans of both genres will find much to enjoy.  If the world wasn't exciting enough on its own, the adventure is of the edge-of-your-seat variety.  Art and Myrtle tumble from one tense situation to another with alarming frequency.  Most chapters end on cliffhangers, so be prepared to have trouble finding a place to pause.  Reeve throws in enough twists and turns to keep readers guessing right until the end, and both Art and Myrtle get the chance to play hero.  Art, as the main character, is not yet a teen himself, so teens may find his narration a little immature for their liking.  If they're willing to give him a chance, though, they will discover that LARKLIGHT is a fast-paced, imaginative journey well worth taking.  Reviewed by:  Lynn Cro+books
excellent book for intuition+P+a very good nontechnical book. kennedy does a great job of providing insight into an often obscure subject. excellent companion book to go along with a more technical book like Greene or Hayashi+books
Not Very Informative.+N+Has some good topics discussed. Would not recommend this book as a starter in labor law+books
Great ideas but totally inadequate instruction+N+As a sales pitch for Tellington Touch, this book is great. As an instruction manual, it is totally worthless. Complex gestures such as those mentioned in the book need illustrations that take one step-by-step through the manipulation process. There aren't any, just a few photos that show one stop action part of the whole.   It did get me to take a T-Touch workshop, which was beneficial for my old and arthritic dog. The process works. The book doesn't+books
No CD No Buy+N+I bought the Panther edition of this book, and found it contained a great deal of useful information. However, I felt it did not serve well for a reference material for two reasons...  1. This book is huge. It needs to be perfect bound or made into two separate volumes.  2. Though the index is quite extensive, there is no way to adequately search the book for troubleshooting Mac OSX.  Both points would be obviated by the inclusion of a CD containing an ebook, preferably as a PDF. I reported this to the publisher, but apparently they disagree since this version does not include a disc. For this reason, I have decided not to purchase this book until future editions include this. I'm writing this here in hopes that the publisher will read this, and act accordingly+books
Didactic and morally condescending+N+My biggest complaint is Willis's assumptions about the reader. She assumes every reader is deeply and fundamentally flawed, with money only exacerbating existing conditions. People that are relatively level-headed and well-adjusted will find little in this book about the trouble money can bring. They will, however, find out how money affects those that already have psychological issues. The book should not be used as a predictor of the problems that come with money.  Moreover, she also assumes that the reader is well-versed in Christian values and are open to Christian citations, further narrowing readability. In chapters where a case-file would be helpful, Willis instead harkens to biblical texts and the parables of Jesus to validate her insights.  For interest's sake, Willis also highlights mostly stories of the extreme, case-files that seem to relate to only few people. Occasionally, an example will be aptly targeted toward most of the audience, but most of the time, the cases apply to people that have inherited many millions or posses standing, major psychological issues. Furthermore, the lessons that the author distills from her case files are rather ambiguous and broad. It is a somewhat veiled example of "fortune cookie" therapy. In the key moments where Willis could show the reader how to learn from the extreme cases, the author resorts to a very unspecific retelling of the case-file, with little insight about how to improve.  The book might have been substantially stronger given more real-life examples with deft analyses. In addition, the book has an overall patronizing nature that needs to be addressed. The author, someone that has seen so many problems afflicting inheritors, has the chance to truly help without adding too many personal feelings but instead insists on injecting an air of moral superiority.  I picked up the book as a complete novice in the world of inheritance and its ramifications. Unfortunately, I remain as such, due to the handbook's narrow aim and arrogant nature+books
Useful in the extreme.+P+A wonderful, lucid, entertaining and informative guide. Craig takes the reader step-by-step through some of the principal works of ancient and modern philosophy, and provides us with an essential guide to the somewhat daunting task of deciphering and understanding a range of compelling thinkers and their works. With an engaging, friendly writing style (and an excellent bibliography to encourage us to continue our journey), this is an indispensable little volume+books
Wonderful book+P+This is a great telling of the story of Ruby Bridges, the first African American child to attend an all-white New Orleans school.  The book does a very good job of explaining on a child's level, what Ruby went through and why.  The book was written by a child psychiatrist who witnessed her going into school and being shouted at by the angry mob and met with to allow her an outlet for her fears and feelings.  Don't give too much credence to the reviewer who slammed the book because of the "pointless" religious scene. The mentions of religion are not pointless because faith is what helped Ruby and her family through this difficult time...faith in God was part of who they were.  Furthermore, although the book doesn't directly go into gory details about the things that were said to and about Ruby, it clearly explains that the whites didn't want their children in school with Ruby and why.  No book is going to answer all a child's questions on any subject, but this one is a great way to open up the lines of communication and a great way to introduce the subject.  An interesting side note: According to Ruby Bridges web site, Mrs. Henry, her beloved teacher, was not rehired by William Franz elementary school the following year.  One must assume that her loving care of Ruby and her refusal to subscribe to the racist views made her unwelcome+books

Good for a Fun Read+P+This text provides an interesting overall account of oddities that happened during one of the greatest conflicts of all time.  There are some factual data within the book that well-versed readers have identified that could possibly be considered in a later edition.  For these individuals, there are countless multi-volume and 500+ page accounts of the history of World War II.  However, to a novice, this work provides short, readable sections about interesting and less known aspects of the Second World War.  This book makes one reflect on the strange little things that can alter the course of human history.  If nothing else, it raises your curiosity to read more works on the topic or the issue or story that you are most interested in.  After all, isn't that what reading and exploring information is all about+books

Modern Navy pilots have become push-button warriors+P+"The Killing Sky" is the fifth book in Robert Gandt's great series of novels about Brick Maxwell, and it's one of the two best. (My other favorite is "Acts of Vengeance", the second book in the series.)  Brick Maxwell is a U.S. Navy pilot and squadron leader, flying an F/A-18 Super Hornet off the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan, stationed in the eastern end of the Mediterranean Sea. The story starts with a joint exercise with the Israeli Air Force ending with an American F/A-18 getting shot down for real!  What went wrong? Did the Israeli pilot really push the missile launch button instead of just announcing a simulated kill? And why does the female Israeli Mossad agent make a play for Brick Maxwell? Is she trying to get information out of him or does she have other motives?  This book contains the same three general plot elements as most of Robert Gandt's novels:  - exciting "you're sitting in the cockpit" descriptions of modern Navy flight operations, with dogfights, carrier-based landings and takeoffs, and push-button warfare with modern smart bombs and missiles.  - geopolitical machinations, this time involving high-level Americans and Israelis and Palestinians. And to keep the excitement up there are internal conflicts within each national group, including a really nasty American political envoy with presidential ambitions.  - romantic involvement for Brick, this time involving not just one but two women.  I liked this book a lot, despite the rather slow start. The suspense gets cranked up by the under-handed dealings going on between the politicians and the resulting armed conflicts between the Palestinians, the Israelis and the American forces. Is the United States really going to invade Palestine and engineer a democratic process, just like in Iraq? And who is really behind the decisions that are causing the continued escalation of hostilities?  One of my criticisms of Robert Gandt's novels is that the characters don't really come across as real people. This is still true in "The Killing Sky", but less so than in the first books in the series, another plus for this book.  Recommended for all fans of military action novels, as is the whole Brick Maxwell series.  Rennie Peterse+books

Southern Accents?+N+I thought the narrator was terrible. She is under the impression that people in upstate New York have southern accents.  Or maybe she never figured out where the story takes place. It must be the mint juleps that confused her. You'd think there would be an editor or coach that would notice this discrepancy, but I guess if nobody could be bothered to edit the author's work, they certainly couldn't worry about the narrator's accents+books
Full of Inappropriate Conclusions, but Well-Intentioned+N+I can see very little reason for the Dalai Lama to write a book on science.  He is out of his league in writing this book.  He does not at all understand his subject matter.  His points on the convergence of modern physics and Buddhist philosophy are irrelevant.  First, any similarities between modern cosmology or quantum mechanics and Buddhist philosophy are purely coincidental, and are not reflective of any deep truth.  We arrive at scientific knowledge through a process of hypothesization and experimentation, the hypotheses being rigidly defined and definitely falsifiable.  Buddhist philosophy does not contain this same element of falsifiability, its grounding in the empirical world being loose and open to interpretation.  One cannot describe an objective procedure to rigorously falsify a Buddhist claim.  Further, these claims are not rigidly defined, and widely open to interpretation, unlike the claims of modern physics, which result in a single answer to a calculation (although in practice one will end up making subjective approximations, but there is a procedure for estimating the error incurred in these approximations).  Second, it is not at all surprising that one can draw some superficial parallels between physics and Buddhism, because the body of Buddhist thought is large enough and equivocal enough that one could point to similarities no matter what physics' worldview is.  I do not understand the Dalai Lama's request that research in the subject of consciousness include internal examination.  The definition of the nature of this internal examination is unclear, and procedure for carrying it out are not described.  His suggestions are useless to scientists without being made more clear.  His claims on what science is and is not capable of achieving or understanding are based on insufficient knowledge.  Even respected, established scientists who make claims on what science cannot achieve have historically been proven incorrect many times over.  I commend the Dalai Lama's interest in science.  Further, I am amazed at his open-mindedness in writing, "if scientific analysis were conclusively to demonstrate certain claims in Buddhism to be false, then we must accept the findings of science and abandon those claims."  He proved true to his word in renouncing certain Buddhist beliefs about the physical workings of the universe.  However, his understanding of the method and teachings of science proved superficial when he argued that because science has not conclusively proven it completely understands the beginning of the universe or the origin of life, this leaves room for supernatural influence to have caused the universe to exist, or for new souls to inherit old ones through reincarnation.  Science treats questions of the supernatural (defined as those things beyond nature, in other words those things that can not be observed) as fundamentally unanswerable and uninteresting, but the Dalai Lama does not seem to understand this attitude.  The Dalai Lama has discussed science with many leading researchers and philosophers of science, such as David Bohm and Arthur Zajonc.  I have no doubt that these he is well-informed, and that these men have done their best to impart their knowledge.  But the gap between Western and Eastern thought in this case may be too wide to be easily bridged, and the responsibility lies in another man to do it.  It may be that no one alive has a truly deep understanding of both Buddhist philosophy and the philosophy of science.  Finally, I also applaud the Dalai Lama's calls for collaboration, and his attempts to spread some introductory knowledge of Buddhist thought.  But the task of creating productive dialogues between scientists and Buddhists is an overwhelming one, involving not only language barriers, but barriers involving fundamental modes of thought.  This book is not equal to the challenge, but I think the Dalai Lama's initial efforts are at least a step in the right direction+books
Is there a cosmic blueprint?+P+This (2004 edition) is an updated re-publication of Davies' 1988 book. In the new preface, Davies (mathematical physicist, prolific writer, recipient of the Faraday Prize, the Kelvin Medal, and the Templeton Prize) suggests the possibility of something quite outlandish--that if humanity can somehow survive the full future of the universe, that upon the universe's thermodynamic and quantum demise, our descendants might scramble into a new universe of their own manufacture. The assertion brings several thoughts to mind, we might begin with, well, let's say, idea-heisting [I'll not say plagiar_sm, that would be a bit harsh]. (Frank Tipler famously envisioned this kind of scenario in a universe headed for a "big crunch." The big crunch has currently fallen out of favor with astronomers and theorists, and Davies' invented universe envisions the currently favored thermodynamic "big fade away" scenario.) It also might strike us as unrealistic or even arrogant; but, foolish or not, Davies' reason for such 'optimism' is unveiled in the following 200 pages.  What follows is a fast-paced and critical tour-de-force of the state of current and emerging scientific theories and prospects (promising and otherwise) for the future. There are many outstanding discussions, one centered on the mathematics of self-similar scaling -- the "Mandelbrot set" being a famous example. Davies believes that, in principle, science will one day explain, comprehensively, how the world works. Don't hold your breath, we're not exactly close to that day just yet. In some significant areas, notably the deepest theoretical understandings of biological and mind sciences, there seems to have been rather little progress at all. From popular treatments [like glossy spreads in National Geographic magazine, or Discovery Channel shows], one might be led to believe that great insights have been gained into how biological evolution proceeds and how life arises spontaneously from non-life. Davies surveys the competing claims and theories in these disciplines and exposes them as being starkly impotent to date. (There is a popular myth that only religious fundamentalists are skeptical of the neo-Darwinian story line -- but many of the most penetrating minds of modern theoretical science and mathematics, including Werner Heisenberg, Niels Bohr, John von Neumann, and Kurt Godel, among others, have found the Darwinian story to be non-compelling at best, and on some points glaringly wrong. As Davies points out, a world in which 'natural selection' was The Great Generative Engine, supporting only reproductive advantages, many life forms that we observe, like elephants [low birth rate, long gestation period, etc], could not have been 'selected' into existence. It does no good to protest that elephants should not and could not reproduce like bunnies -- in a truly Darwinian world there simply should not be elephants [or humans: striving to discern whether the universe might be headed toward a 'big crunch' or a 'heat death' can offer no reproductive advantage for beings given to contemplating such things!]. One thinks of many Darwin-confuters in the plant kingdom. A world built by Darwinian mechanisms would be populated only by masters of mitosis, and perhaps sex-maniacs that mated like bunnies, although sex itself, a comparatively inefficient means of reproduction [obviously when compared to mitotic reproduction], is another intractable problem for the Darwinian story.) Davies, like many noted physicists, is well studied and articulate in theoretical biology, and finds the state of neo-Darwinian evolutionary theory to be mostly a patched-up, just-so story that is easy fodder for skepticism. He does, however, believe that Stuart Kaufmann's ideas concerning holistic approaches to understanding complexity may be more fruitful. However I give a wrong impression if I seem to suggest that the book is largely about biological evolution, it is not. This is but one of several illuminating discussions, most of which understandably center on mathematical physics.  Davies, an epistemological optimist at any rate, expects that theoretical biology and mind science will one day succumb to our advancing knowledge, and that we will know, exhaustively, how the world works. But to know how the world works is not to know why the world works. Even if science should attain a reductionistic "theory of everything" and a stunning cadre of holistic theories explaining all features of 'emergence' and 'complexity', the big Why question(s) will remain, and any answers will remain as matters of faith, not strict science. Science speaks to "how," but why should this be so? Why should there be an explainable world and why should it contain world-explainers? One can deny teleological inference and many materialists insist [religiously] on doing so, but the denial is one of personal choice, not actual science. The world IS 'up to something,' and this fact IS fundamentally written into the new physics. The mysterious profundity of "why" always remains. In the day that Davies foresees, when physical science has achieved its final triumph, it will not have dispensed with God and it will not have written purpose out of the world.  Well, that's the book in a nutshell, but there's much more to it. I've read something like ten of Davies' books; most of them being either 'good' or 'very good' (with one notable exception) and this volume fits either category, except, perhaps, for that wild assertion in the new preface+books
Nothing New.  Not that funny+N+For $10 I guess its fine, but I didn't learn anything from this book at all.  If anything, I actually feel more alienated.  I do not live in the gay neighborhood of my city nor do I hang out exclusively with gay people.  However, coexisting with straight people isn't even a passing thought in this book.  Basically, if you don't live as a cher-worshipping rainbow flag waving poster child of gaydom, the book paints you as a maladjusted closet case who should be avoided at all costs.  I agree with the review that said this is a good guide to turning into a "flaky queen".  Also, I cannot even count the number of times alcohol is referred to in this book (and I rarely drink) but any drug use is met with a "kick him to the curb, girlfriend" attitude (I don't do drugs either, but I'm just pointing it out).  The book does not answer any central questions about what men want.  There is research out there about how important a good body *really* is and how important masculine traits really are for a relationship vs. hookup.  This author did not pull any of that in.  However, there is an underlying assumption that ALL gay men go to the gym, and usually that is an all-gay gym (so I guess a good body is really important to him...).  As far as the authors take on the value that gay men place on education or personal growth - oh wait - neither topic is ever mentioned.  The whole book can be summed up with the fact that the author actually gives advice on "what to say if he catches you looking at his Streisand CDs when he comes out of the bathroom".  So, essentially, the book is a disappointing series of common-sense superficial tips that anyone who went to high school already knows:  "don't seem needy or desperate, be confident, don't go into your whole life story on the first date."  I mean, if you're THAT clueless about dating... then go for it.   Maybe I would've found this useful at 16 or 17, however.  (Oh, by the way I just learned that being 30 is old.  It's mentioned about 4 times.)  I also like how there is a whole chapter devoted to what you should hide & display in your bathroom (aveda = bad... generic shaving cream = good). Um, by the time a guy is in my bathroom, he is probably on his way to having sex with me so I think it'll just have to be ok if he sees moisturizer with retinol.  If he wants to end the relationship over my brand of shaving cream (yes, that is mentioned as well) then I'm done too.  What is amazing is that in previous chapters, "being your fabulous gay self" is encouraged, but now we're playing "hide the gay cosmetics?"   The book is replete with hypocritical counsel, vague generalizations, and inconsistencies.  I suppose, then, it is more of a metaphor of gay dating than a guide to it.+books
This is not a novel...+P+It is the screenplay of the movie, the same one that should have won the Oscar this year.  For people who haven't seen the movie, reading the screenplay first may not be such a great idea.  I know this movie went over a lot of people's heads, and I'm not positive one can fully appreciate the story from just reading it.  However, I definately recommend reading it after seeing the movie, there is so much great dialogue that is easily missed and a lot of subtle humor that is more obvious written on the page.  This was one of the best movies of 2001 and the screenplay is a great way to appreciate it again while waiting for the dvd+books
Very outdated+N+Of historical interest only, this book never was a comprehensive overview of musical acoustics, instead focusing on Benade's interests.  Now, it is horribly outdated.  Much interesting work is not in here...in fact there is no really top notch acoustics book with modern research available at this time+books
Very badly written book+N+First things firts.....I am clueless as to why the reviews online for this book have stars enough to fill the sky. Unless written by friends (that too, the really good and loyal ones) the book would not deserve even a 2 star. Infact I looked for 1/2 a star and couldnt find one.  The narration is plainly put, silly and yada yada. Rambling without a direction and generous usage of Indian words like Chambu is totally uncalled for considering the that the target is a world audience. Amulya should read  and re re re read Arundati Roy's God of Small Things to see how the soft balance between something Indian yet talking crystal clear to the Western soul is acheived. I read blurbs of the other books written by Amulya and the narrative is as Blah as it is in this one. I am not trying to be vicious here, but plain frank since the other reviews are so unreasonably off the target.  A very boringly, tedious, soporiphic rambling of a book. I would not recommend this to any one+books
Hit or miss...+N+Ehhh... I'm just not real impressed with this one.  First of all - splitting the larger sun sign categories into subgroups is kinda nice, but also kinda vague.  It's essentially a re-working of the standard sun sign stereotypes, and if you're interested in astrology at all, you know them already.  Don't get me wrong - it's not *bad.*  There's no wrong information, it's passably accurate (for astrology.)  I can see how it would be very helpful for those on cusps, and even for the rest of us, it's occasionally got some new info (this book, for instance, is the first one to accurately point out some quieter aspects of my personality that go against the Aries norm.)  It's just not enough to get excited over, and most people will get the same level of accuracy or better by just going whole hog and getting a star chart done.  Secondly, and more irritatingly, the actual relationship pairings were astonishingly scattershot.  I think it would have been easier to deal with if they'd ALL just been laughably wrong, but no - after slogging through, say, 4 or 5 descriptions that could have been describing total strangers (because they certainly weren't describing me and my people), I'd hit upon something like "Confidential Projects," which was just a spot-on explanation of the vibe between me & my brother.  What do you do with a book like that?  (Also?  As has been noted by other reviewers, the book really is amazingly negative about almost every relationship pairing.  If I were to take it seriously, I'd be huddled in the corner now, wide-eyed, whimpering "nobody loves me and I have no real friends!"  Sheesh.)  It leads me to one of two conclusions: 1) it really is scattershot - they're just throwing it at a wall and seeing what sticks; or, 2) they're actually on to something, but haven't worked out all the kinks yet.  Which wouldn't be too bad, except that it's being published as a finished product, you know?  Final recommendation: pass.  If you're reading for entertainment, there are more entertaining astrology books out there; if you're a serious student, there are more thorough and accurate books.  If you've got money to burn and don't mind weeding through the stuff that's superfluous and the stuff that's just inaccurate to find the few true additions to this field that this book makes, it might make a decent addition to round out a library.  Just please don't be fooled into thinking this is the be-all and end-all of relationship astrology+books
Learn the lessons of history or repeat it+N+Boy, I hate to point out a negative here, but to say that fundamentalism is a way of holding a belief and not about content is historically ill informed. Fundamentalism began as a reaction against denominational seminaries adopting theological views that were viewed as against scripture in their content. Here are a few of those issues. You tell me if you think they are content or ways of holding it: Jesus was not born of a virgin. Many of the miracles of Jesus were fictional. Jesus did not necesarily raise from the dead. Most of the more outrageous Old Testament stories were not to be taken as historically accurate. I could go on. Has he not read what really happened historically to create that movement??? Big mistake, or real dishonest! Even now Rollins goes about building what they reacted against. Rollins says he will not be undermining Chrisitan content, but he is opening the door for those who will. In fact, for him to make the following statement about life after death makes me wonder if he really cares about truth or his post modern posture. "Death is a term that refers to the end of all experience. Regardless of what, if anything, happens after this event,..."page 47  He strives to make his own point at the expense of Christian truth.  Fundamentalism, even today, in it's popularly decried "no fun, too much dam, and not enough mental" caricature is really primarily about content and only secondarily about how they hold their views.  It was born in a fight and Rollins wants to take us back into the fight. Evangelicalism is the answer as to content and holding it rightly, but Rollins really does not believe in answers.+books

The secret Doctrine of the Rosicrucians+N+I am a Rosicrucian and this book is not about Rosicrucians or their Doctrines. As far as I can make out this is from one of those "wantabes".  I found it to be totally useless. If you are truely interested in mystical knowledge, the school still exists and is very welcoming to seekers. ( google AMORC) If you are only seeking a book try The Wisdom of the Mystic Masters by Joseph J Weed.  This book gives a true overview of RC. The focus in on practical self development that can be used right here on the Earth Plane for your evolution.  Its a wonderful life, if you have the right atttiude and are willing to change!+books
Knitting Backwards+P+The story is about a young boy called JP whose life falls apart after his grandmther's death, but chaos really starts to heat up when they win an old farmhouse.

So at first JP defies his mother and ehr group of friends, then he tries to fit in but either way he cannot. Everything JP holds dear and dependalble unraveld withen the firdays at his new home so he is left with nothing but the bare threads of his once normal life. While this happened his mother and her group of lost friends are starting to weave the threads belonging in ther lives and to find themselves.

Another Masterpiece+P+Another masterpiece from Donaldson.  Pick it up and READ it.... if you like it try out his other books.      The story of Angus and Morn  continues, even more gripping and well developed than in the first book.   Like The Real Story, there is bleakness and desolation, but they only serve  to highlight the characters.  The extremes that they are forced to  experience shape them and make them believable as individuals, and make  this book very dramatic and powerful.  You are brought to understand and  care about the characters, and by the end you will find yourself looking on  to the next book.   After reading this book I went out and bought the rest  of the series.... I had no fears about being disappointed by any of the  books, and I wasn't.  Two other people in my family were hooked on this  series as well, once I showed it to them(they almost strangled me for  losing the third book :) +books
This book annoyed me.+N+Ok so when I first started reading the book I thought all right this is ok.  And the book went along and I still thought it was ok good at times but just a decent book.  Then I finished the book and I realized something.  Nothing had happened really.  There was nothing to tell you what the overall plot would be for the triolgy it was just them going from once place to the other.  Its like oh there is a ghost we should follow it, yeah because that is such a smart thing to do.  This book just annoyed me so much because nothing happend in it.  I don't really understand why so many people love this book.  This book is average at best and not much else.     +books
The side few knew+P+First, I'd like to stress that this book, just like its title indicates, is not supposed to appeal to the nostalgia-ridden fans and conspiracy theorists that once found common ground on movies like 'JFK.' Seymour Hersh's 'Dark side of Camelot' is indicting as it is jaw-dropping. In one of the more revealing accounts, Hersh takes on the task of dispelling the peace-loving, freedom-advocate myth surrounding the J.F. Kennedy cult by confirming a long-held, yet underrated perpective that historical events such as the Cuban Missile crisis were in great part exacerbated by the late president and his brother Robert's domestic political ambitions, even when doing so required using the mafia as a reliable ally for the defense of the 'free world' as depicted by the Kennedys. It was  the Kennedys' obsesion to bring Castro down and the urge to appear 'strong of communism' that brought the world to the brink of nuclear war with the prospect of a catastrophic invasion that was planned after the Bay of Pigs fiasco. Hersh accounts of US and Soviet generals, CIA officers, and other sources of authority complement this view with chilling details.  The Vietnam war also had Kennedy's fingerprints all over it, according to Hersh's findings. Kennedy's was as eager as Richard Nixon to continue running the war at the expense of hundreds of thousands of lives when the former approved of Vietnamese strongman Diem's murder, although Kennedy was well aware that Diem and his brother had started backchannel negotiations with the communist and buddhist opposition in South Vietnam to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict. At the end, Diem's pro-US rivals in the military took over and resumed the reign of terror and reppression that had been encouraged by Kennedy's most hawkish advisers in the Pentagon.   The 'Dark side of Camelot' is not only a political indictment of John F. Kennedy, but also an impeachment on utter immorality by a U.S. head of state. In one of at least four main accounts from ex-Secret Service officers, president Kennedy was courted by members of his cabinet with young club girls who were often threatened with lock-ups in asylums if they dared to speak about their sexual anecdotes with president Kennedy and his entourage. Kennedy's promiscuous behavior opened the door for venereal diseases, such as Chlamydia, to haunt him until the day of his death, according to medical records cited by Hersh.  For revelations like these ones, it is likely that the 'Dark Side of Camelot' be dismissed as a gossip-teller on the sexual life of John F. Kennedy, however, it will prove immensely valuable for those who wish to pursue the trail of elussive puzzle parts that shaped U.S. government policy during some of the most impacting world events of the 20th century                +books

You aren't seriously considering buying this... are you?+N+Considering that it's now been a year after the title date, and no comet has struck the Earth, let alone Greece (during the Olympics, yet), this book is a flop. Put a prediction and date in your title, trot out Nostradamus, and you may find that your audience expects results. To quote Marvin the Martian: "Where's the Kaboom? There was supposed to be an Earth-shattering Kaboom!".  Don't worry, I'm sure Welch will write another book with amended predictions.

The weird underbelly of an intellectual pastime+P+J.C. Hallman's The Chess Artist is structured around a trip that the author took with his friend Glenn, the chess player of the book's title, to Kalmykia, a crumbling Russian Republic on the northwest shore of the Caspian Sea. Hallman was interested in interviewing Kalmykia's despotic president, Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, a former chess prodigy and the president of the World Chess Federation (FIDE), who was using chess "as a tool to unify and mollify his people." (He had made chess instruction compulsory in schools, for example.) Woven around the story of their journey are chapters on chess history--its development and geographical migration across a thousand years, the history of its individual pieces--and Hallman's further adventures with Glenn: marathon chess sessions over the internet, formal chess competitions, blindfolded chess and speed chess, chess played in prison and in Princeton, and the various characters they ran across on their adventures--child prodigies and the denizens of Dickensian chess shops and the down-and-out chess hustlers of New York's Washington Square Park.  Part travelogue, then, and part history, Hallman's book is also an exploration of both the international subculture of competitive chess and of his traveling companion. For most of the period covered by the book, Glenn was ranked as a chess master--exceptionally good but well below the grandmasters who form the true elite of the chess world. Glenn is an enigmatic character. A germophobic 39-year-old with a genius for the game and poor grammar, he is apparently incapable of consistently making smart decisions in the real world. Divorced and perpetually broke, almost childish at times, his friendship seems to be to a great extent a burden. Hallman has a tendency, actually, to write about Glenn as if he were a sort of lab animal, whose mannerisms and mode of play are alike under scrutiny.  "He shrugged and performed a gesture that was new to me, opening his palms suddenly and at the same time contorting his face to an expression of exaggerated surprise."  Annoying and strange, given to marking promising relationships with ceremonial whistling, Glenn is also a sad figure, a broken man "spiraling toward nothingness, a waste of twenty years of effort and energy." One wonders what Glenn thought of his presentation in the book.  The Chess Artist is very well researched and thick with information. And it is punctuated by some truly wonderful, sometimes poetic writing:  "The train was all lullaby, the gyroscopic jostle of the tracks, the steady click of the wheels like the eighth notes of some slower melody, the stars stationary out the small window, all of it a lull of travel nostalgia, a cradle or warm womb, Glenn and I like twins incubating in that cramped space."   In Kalmykia Hallman is served "a genocide of crayfish"; in a prison cafeteria the fare is instead "hockey pucks of meat like the leftover scrapings of a botched autopsy." One chess player they observe has the "eyebrows of a demon," while another is "a nondescript man who fit the profile of a serial killer--short, well-groomed, quiet, and very dangerous."  Hallman's writing is riddled with such evocative descriptions. This is both wonderful and, surprisingly perhaps, problematic: the problem is that Hallman tends to lavish his well-written descriptions on nearly every minor character who crosses his path, so that the reader is met with too much information. Hallman's flair is obvious. But after a time, the personalities in the book tend to blend together.  It is tempting to say that Hallman does for chess what Stefan Fatsis does for Scrabble in his book Word Freak, exposing the weird underbelly of an intellectual pastime, the obsessives who sacrifice sleep and hygiene over their chosen game. Hallman's book, though, is a more serious and more difficult read. Presumably, the more familiar a reader is with chess, the more he will get out of the book. I myself do not play, but I was able to understand and appreciate, at least on some level, most of what the author had to say. Non-chess players should not be afraid of diving in.

Toning The Sweep+P+This was a good book because it show some values that you can find on the family, and how emily try to understand why her mama didn't like the desert. After she start to find answers at her questions she also get to know better her grandmama Ola by making a videotape where she get to know better Ola's friends and learn to get along with people. This Book show the way that this people were traveling scaping from something that is call saness going through different places, the real reason that Ola was runing away from alabama was to save Diane from the ugliness deth like it say on the book but this wasn't the good way because you have to get infrom of your problems to solves them. That is why I agree with Diane that ola wasn't suppose to run away fron something she shouldn't. By the time Emily find the reason Diane didn't like the desert was because she didn't want to get away from the pain of her father that she found dead near a field of kudzu. That was the day that Emily really felt for her mama and understand her loss. It say that Diane won't ever forgive her mother from ripping it away. Because I think that the only things that where attach to Diane and that she remember about her father were gone and the only memory she has about her father were in her heart and that is okay because she will never forget her father even that she don't have any oject that may remember her him. I think that Emily realize that it really don't take that long to get to know someboy if you really want to know them. I think Emily haves a positive change because she learn to appreciate more her family and to understand the situation they hava passe. I think Ola and Emily really like the desert because there they really felt free like a bird and freedon if one of the most important value in the world. If you don't think like that I do. I really like this book even that it show all the pain this people have and or their loss. But at the end it really teach you that family is very important If you haven't read this book do it because it can help you to apreciate it more. That all I have to say I hope you like what I have done+books

reinforced dogma+N+If you want your dogma reinforced then this is a great book. It blazes through philosophical arguments with proposterous nerve.  example 1. The problem of evil is solved thus: "And God has done something about the problem of evil. He has done the most dramatic, costly, and effective thing possible by giving his Son to die for evil men."  example 2. To John Wisdoms damning parable, the book argues: "For in Christianity we do not have merely an allegation that the garden of this world is tended by a loving Gardener; we have the actual, empirical entrance of the Gardener into the human scene in the person of Christ (cf. John 20: 14,15), and this entrance is verifiable by way of His resurrection."   All of the arguments assume the ignorant position. The argument from design is entertained in the most ridiculous manner -arguing from the specific to the general. Reality is simple -we are here because things are the way they are -if they weren't, we wouldn't be here. Too many leaves in the teacup being read by those who want to see things that are not there. I'm afraid for humanity if they think this is knowledge. +books
great help+P+I just actually finished reading this book yesterday. It was given to me by my counselor, to whom I seem to talk to quite often about my son's behavior and how frustrating it is to me. I was amazed with each new section of this book at how many of these behaviors are caused by temperment. I've been told in that past that my son (7 years old) has a difficult temperment, but I never really "got it" until I read this book. I didn't realize that a lot of what goes on isn't even in his control a lot of the time....that's just how his temperment causes him to act or react. I couldn't believe how much of this book "hit the nail on the head" as I was reading it. It really made me feel like there may just be something I can do about my son's difficult behaviors and his attitude and "freshness". I can't wait to try all of the suggestions that Stanley Turecki gives. I can finally now see that things my son did even as a small toddler relate to all of his tempermental issues and that I am not being a "bad" mom like I've so often felt I was.  I highly recommend this book to any parent of a hard-to-raise and hard to understand child. You'll surely walk away with some enlightenment and some great tools to help you with your child and also to help your child to better his/herself.+books
Old Delinsky material is misleading and not very good!+N+I have read all of Barbara Delinsky's books.  Of those books, there have been a number of rereleases.  What is annoying is that alot of romance writers are doing this, and their material is not always as good as the current price of a paperback.  If a book was released in 1983 the price of  the paperback should be lower, and the cover of the paperback should also  have an indication that this book has just been rereleased with the current  content untouched.  I'm from Ottawa, Canada and this paperback was very expensive. Alot of money for an outdated storyline and not much of a story to tell+books
Disappointing+N+While the characters of this story are engaging, there's no follow through.  You don't really get an idea of what happens to people at the end.  You are left to your own imagination for a lot of instances.  I understand that it is Christian fiction since it refers to numerous biblical quotes, but we really don't get an idea of people's faith.  The people don't really seem to have a relationship with God.  I was truly disappointed+books
Truly interesting and unconventional stories+P+I teach short-story writing, and I've had my students read this book because it shows that there is still a way to &quot;make it new&quot; in the story form.  Arvin's stories, all of them, have nice surprises in form or content. He is not satisfied with cliches or overused word or character packages. His historical pieces don't smack of research, but present a complex world with compelling characters. The stories are not of interest to solely writers; they're compelling to anyone who cares about the human heart. I look forward to reading his novel, Articles of War, which I've heard is coming out from Doubleday in January 2005+books
"This excitement has put us behind in our drinking."+P+What a difference three years can make. Between 1930 (when Hammett finished "The Glass Key," perhaps his bleakest work) and 1933 (when he published "The Thin Man," his last novel), Hammett had discovered two things that transformed his outlook on life: a steady income from book sales and from Hollywood filmwriting and, perhaps more important, Lillian Hellman.   There's surely nothing like being unexpectedly wealthy and suddenly in love: Hammett's changed outlook on life is even more apparent when one compares the 65-page outline of "The Thin Man" he set aside in 1931 with the final version of his book, which seems to be more of a light-hearted and satirical tribute to the traditional whodunit than a continuation of the gloomy noir of his earlier novels.  While his first four novels, as well as the early draft, featured an anti-Establishment loner (the Continental Op, Sam Spade, Ned Beaumont), "The Thin Man" introduces Nick and Nora Charles as a pair of unlikely crime-busters breaking off their vacation in New York (which consists mostly of drinking at any available venue) to solve a murder. Readers with only a passing knowledge of Hammett's biography will recognize both Hammett and Hellman as the inspirations for the alcoholic ex-sleuth and his socially savvy wife.  What also separates "The Thin Man" from Hammett's other full-length works is its giddy humor, which revolves around seedy nightlife, early-morning alcohol consumption, and Nick and Nora's freethinking rapport, while the dialogue pokes fun at the tough-guy image and the mystery form itself. The morning after being grazed by a bullet, Nora asks Nick: "How do you feel?" "Terrible, I must've gone to bed sober." This playful banter takes up much of the book and supplies one of its greatest pleasures.  Many Hammett fans have long regarded "The Thin Man" as his weakest novel, and I tend to agree--up to a point. This book lacks the quality for which the others are famous: uniqueness (for lack of a better word). Although it's a sophisticated Manhattan comedy, Hammett's last detective novel is a lot like many other whodunits, and his unexpectedly relaxed and newly satisfied voice often doesn't ring true. Even so, it's a shining example of the traditional mystery and a lot of fun to read+books
Until You+N+I have never enjoyed reading the novels of one historical romance author so much. But this was a dissapointment Ms. Small! Altough she always has bored me a trifle with her details, the plots are usually well thought out and intriguing. But in this novel, after finding the love of her life, Patrick has dementia and they cancel their wedding plans. After two years she lets Logan who pursues her constantly throughout the novel take her body and her hand in matrimony after she refuses him so long! When it says: "Rosamund sat up. What was she doing? She jumped from her bed, lokking to gather up her other garments. "You shall not have me you monster!" I thought she was coming to her senses and would finally wait on her true love to regain his memory , but alas twas not to be. She should not have married again. It was tantamount to a betrayal! I am so mad atMs. Small for ending this book this way! I give the book two stars for the romance of a lifetime she allowed us to see between Rosamund and Patrick+books
Bad+N+This book is incredibly boring and tedious to read.  It has no plot; I fell asleep every time I tried to read it.  It isn't realistic, as some attest, becuase the Indians have the ability to talk to animals.  Remarkably, their dreams are always perfectly accurate prophecies; James Welch takes foreshadowing a little too far.  A final warning: this book is not appropriate for younger readers due to excessive descriptions of sexual desires and acts, including adultery and incest+books
An excellent intro text for students interested in EM+P+This is a very readable text that distills the essential clinical  information that you will need on your EM rotation.  It is well cross  referenced and gives an excellent intro to the material.  I would not use  it as your only text as it does not have enough depth on its own.  This  text will suffice however if you have some background knowledge upon which  to build on.  Overall a great tex+books
ineffective text book+N+The author made a huge mistake with this one.  It is so basic, meaning a lack of pictures and good graphics to lower its cost, that it ends up driving no point home at all.  This book is a complete waste of time.  The  only plus is that it is one of the only true general virology textbooks out  there+books
An excellent read - my kids BEGGED to do History!+P+We read this book as a part of our homeschool History curriculum this year.  It was very informative and entertaining. My children (ages 6 and 8) absolutely loved it.   We have the older version, and my kids didn't even mind the lack of color and the sparse illustrations.  They begged me ,"One more chapter...please, Mom?!"  I would say the only thing I did not care for in this book was the way they portray the Indians.  Other than Squanto, Samoset and Massasoit, all of the other Indians are viewed as 'savages' (and not very intelligent ones, at that.)   In the last few chapters, they are even used as 'comic relief.'   She also has them speaking the word 'Ugh' a lot...such as "Ugh! White squaw bring me cider!" I thought that was a little unrealistic, and insulting as well.  The information on the Pilgrims is wonderful, and she really brought their journey alive.  If you can overlook the Indian parts, I would highly recommend this book.+books

This is the worst and most offensive book I have read+N+I have Cherokee lineage and decided to learn our history, which was not passed down in our family, so I got this book to read in good faith.  The author makes us sound like a bunch of backward, bloodthirsty, superstitious people, and our women to be a bunch of promiscuous (...).  There is little in the book of the trail of tears, and much of what is written prior to it gets off into flights of fancy and imagination of the author, who believes he can mind read for people dead over 150 years.  When he does get around to the actual trail of tears (the last sixth of the book) he briefly accounts what facts or accounts there were, and gets into how not that many people really died, and the Federal Government is being portrayed in a bad light historically.  He also portrays the Cherokee Nation's history as rising and falling with the beginning and ending of his book, treating the Cherokee as a quaint, dead culture and people.  It saddens me that college students are being given this to read.  I learned nothing about my culture and our history from this book+books
Very sloppy writing+N+A short way into Chapter I, we have "...the world had such a large supply of girls, and an even larger supply of perverts."  Really? More perverts than girls?  A few pages later, Tess, our heroine,  drugs one of these perverts with his own Rohypnol, strips him of his clothes, except for his "briefs and socks", and throws his clothes in a dumpster. But in the next sentence "she arranged his wallet, keys, and pager in a pile next to his head and draped his jacket over him."  Without bothering to retrieve the jacket from the dumpster.  There are more examples like these.  When a writer has so little control over the world she creates that absurdities and oxymorons populate it more densely than her characters, I stop reading pretty quickly.  So in fairness I have to say that I only read the first ten percent of this book. Maybe it improves later+books
Not an Accidental Read at all!+P+I had not read much from this author except her 4 book series with Beverly LaHaye, but when our library had this one in large print, I just picked it up "accidentally" and decided to read it. I had not gotten into many pages when I was grabbed by the plot.  I did not even know there WAS a second chance series and I rather wondered how a secular book could be re-written sucessfully as a Christian Fiction book, but this one was wonderful.  When Wes first met Laney, he suspected her of being a stalker and/or kidnapper of children, and he had her arrested. His fears seemed rational until he heard her story. The child of Wes and his deceased wife Patrice, was adopted right after birth, and Laney, the birth mother had finally found them through illegal means. The story then unfolds of two people who have absolutely nothing in common except their love for one little girl, Amy. Through it all the ghost of Wes' dead wife Patrice hangs heavily over both their heads as well as Amy's.   I felt Terri Blackstock drew upon some incredible experience as an author to format and carry through with this suspenseful, love-hate story and the twists and turns which led to a very, very strange and almost unbelievable bond between Wes and Laney.  I wish to thank the author for re-writing this book and for using her talent for her new "boss", God. I am now searching for other second chances books by this author.  +books
Rogovoy Gets it Right+P+Seth Rogovoy has written a rich history of Klezmer music that should prove to be an important contribution to the field of Jewish music. He has captured the spirit and meaning of this most wonderful and expressive  musical traditon that is currently in the midst of a significant rebirth.  This is an intelligent and loving tribute both to the musical tradition,  and to the men and women who have performed Klezmer from generation to  generation+books
Loads of Fun+P+Primality know for his somber novels of great moral dilemmas usually in developing world setting, "Travels with My Aunt" is something of a departure for the great Graham Greene.  With its often absurdly situations this is a deeply comic novel rich in humor.  The story centers on Henry Pulling, a recently retired banker.  He is stuffy, unimaginative, and not one prone to fun.  Shortly after he meets his eccentric aunt, who he has not seen since he was a young child, he ends up on whirlwind travels that are best left for the reader to discover for his or herself.  Suffice to say, however, the novel is very funny and the new world the travels open up to Pulling are only one part of the fun.  Certaily not one of Greene's deeper works, but definetly one of his more entertaining ones.  Enjoy+books
a thoughtful story+P+Maybe it is a strange focus for a book of social studies, not just describing how people talk about themselves, but how they talk about each other.  In the end, I think this is the most interesting part of the book, what it tells us about the gossip of Shanghai people. As a person who grew up in Shanghai and left eight years ago, I am drawn to all stories of Shanghai out of nostalgia and curiousity for my old home.   So I bought this book in the university book store. What I found is an unusual type of story, written by a foreign, well American, man about sex in Shanghai.  Some things he writes are so familiar to me I laughed out loud.  Others are not what I remember of Shanghai.  I like best the stories these people tell about their friends. I remembered some of the stories in my street, and it made me laugh+books
Superficial Analysis +N+This book is good if you want to be warned over and over to wash your hands! If you are looking for the difference between viruses and bacteria, actual scientific references or interesting facts about how germs and bacteria live, reproduce and colonize us - look elsewhere. This book was too preachy and didn't have enough information for anyone with a genuine interest in biology, human physiology, or health.+books
Boring!!!!!+N+OK I love everything else I have ever read by Dara Joy, so when I picked this one up I thought I would be in for a good read. Now normally I'm the type that starts a book once the kids are in bed and before I know it the sun is coming up and I'm wishing 'why can't anything like that ever happen to me'...well it took three days to force myself through this one and once I was done, instead of wishing I was the herione caught up in some adventure, I was pretty happy just to be me. I could not get close to the characters, or into the story surrounding them. And what kills me is that the story line had sooo much potential...haunted manors, kitchen ghosts...I guess I'm even more disappointed because I really do enjoy Dara's other works. If you are going to check this one out I would suggest buying it used+books
5 Stars But Not My Favorite+P+Of course it deserves five stars because of the great author, knowledge of Chinese Culture, good characters and wonderful story. It involves the delicate balance between the old Chinese customs of ancient medicine vs science, the choosing of ones own mate vs the old custom of parents making the choice.  In this case, the family is not peasant but prominent, but the culture just as interesting.  There is no action in this book but more of a love story.  No peasants trying to survive in poverty but a cast of the entitled and a struggle of wills.+books
Amazing man; amazing life+P+Even if you're not a physist you will love this book+books
NO CLOSURE - IT'S 1ST IN A SERIES+N+Look I enjoyed the book a lot, but got nearer and nearer to the end and noticed the plot wasn't wrapping up.  I got that awful sinking feeling that I had been suckered into a book without a good ending, without closure, which I HATE.  Sure enough!  At the bottom of the last page they *FINALLY* admit "Armageddon's Children ends here.  The story will continue with the publication of Terry Brooks's next novel."  NOWHERE on the front cover, back cover or ANYWHERE ELSE but on the last page does it mention this.  I hate being manipulated, and that's why I gave the book one star, and why the publisher Del Ray/Ballantine Books will never get another cent from me+books
Throughly enjoyed this one....+P+I'm not sure I understand the naysayers in this group of reviews. I really enjoyed this book - as good as anything a lot of other authors have written, like David Brin, or Greg Bear (also excellent writers!+books
Don't buy this book!+N+This has to be one of the worst ever organic chemistry books ever devised.  The author will give a detailed explanation with illustrations and at the very end of the discussion , once you have committed the information to memory,  the book will say that it does not happen this way. The author seems to wax poetic,  however,  he gives no simple list of rules for common nomenclature problems,  for example,  I defy you to find a list of how to name alkanes under IUPAC rules. All you want is a simple list , for example,  1) find the longest chain of carbons, 2) .........  instead of this you will be exposed to extraneous quotes from plays and movies as well as anecdotes from the authors life.   Another complaint is that the book gives several good questions in the text and at the end of the chapter,  but NO answers in the back.  If you want the answers,  you have to purchase the 40.00 solution manual.   My condolences to you if your o-chem teacher has been hoodwinked into using this book by  the publisher,  the only advice I can give is that you purchase the solutions manual,   because this gives some very detailed explanations.  Good luck, because you will need it+books
If They Take You In the Morning+P+I remember the first time I realized that James Baldwin was a genius. I picked up one of Angela Davis's autobiographies. I found one of the most beautifully crafted letters ever exchanged from one writer to another.   And with one five page letter, I fell in love.  I am certain that The Price of the Ticket must be one of the greatest collections of essays ever bound into a single volume. If someone would like to challenge that, please be my guest. And, I believe that James Baldwin is probably the second most widley quoted African American writer in epithets, speeches and dedications after Martin Luther King. I admit, I have no statistical data to support these claims. I have no quantitative proof. Just keep your eyes and ears open and you will understand what I mean. Whether it was the text Many Thousands Gone I read in An African History course on Slavery, or the article entitled The Price of the Ticket that I discovered in my Art History course. Baldwin has left an indelible mark on history.   James warned us that, "It is very nearly impossible, after all, to become an educated person in a country so distrustful of the independent mind." (The Can't Turn Back)   He proved to us that, "freedom is not something that anybody can be given; freedom is something people take and people are as free as they want to be." (Notes for a Hypothetical Novel)   Long before Morrison & Cose explanation of the Envy of the World we knew, "alas, that to be an American Negro Male is also to be a kind of walking phallic symbol: which means that one pays, in one's own personality, for the sexual insecurity of others." (The Black Boy Looks at the White Boy)   Before Mumia reminded us Baldwin informed us, "What passes for identity in America is a serise of myths about one's heroic ancestors. It's astounding to me, for example that so many people really appear to believe that the country was founded by a band of heroes who wanted to be free." (A Talk to Teachers)   And years later we still have not grasped the fact that, "Guilt is a luxury we can no longer afford." (Words of a Native Son)   Perhaps Genovese was smiling when Baldwin wrote, "We won our Christianity, our faith, at the point of a gun, not because of the example afforded by white Christains, but in spite of it. It was very difficult to become a Christian if you were a black man on a slave ship, and the slave ship was called "The Good Ship Jesus."   Perhaps the scarriest thing that Baldwin has showed us, is how seldom things change.  Any writer, I suppose, feels that the world into which he was born is nothing less than a conspiracy against the cultivation of his talent. Talent is not to be ignored. Dreams are to be followed, Challenges are to be faced and Art is to be created.+books
haunting powerful+P+I couldn't put this down, from the first fishing trip that turns into a life-changing trap, to the final decisions two young men--and older men--have to make about their history, their lives and their role in re-living or changing history.

Excellent+P+Great, great great! That just sums all there is to be said about this book. With a step by step structure and structured reading this book takes you through the steps of recording, getting the album into the stores, booking concerts and managing the finances. Good title for managers and musicians alike, but songwriters and producers will love it too because ti opens up lots of closed doors and gives a lot of unseen information. Recommended for novices and experienced people alike, do not miss.+books
Much ado about Nothing+N+As an introduction Zen, what has been presented in this book is fine though it could have been done with lot less elitist overtone. I agree Zen and its true comprehension does not come easy (I am talking of regular mortals such as myself here) and words as mere symbols for concepts are distorting when conveying Zen.   I do not propose that I am an expert on Zen or even Buddhism in general but I have read a few books on Buddhism by Thich Nhat Hanh, Dalai Lama, Chogyam Trungpa and others. Though an agnostic who does not care for much for organized religion, I do believe the most fundamental benefit of any spiritual/ religious framework is to instill a sense of compassion toward other beings. You need some kind of cultural creation (religious or otherwise) to counter act the natural tendency of a human to be self-serving. In this aspect, I have high regards for non-theistic Buddhism and the inclusiveness of Vedanta (Hinduism) that proposes all religions eventually lead to the same attainment. From this viewpoint I was surprised with this author.  This author may have been one of the leading authorities on Zen in his time, but unfortunately he comes as an arrogant, elitist, full of prejudices. He does not miss any opportunity to put down other religions or even other sects of Buddhism. Only Zen as practiced by the Rinzai sect is pure, strong and generally worthy of pursuit. Any form of spiritualism from the West is of course hopeless since the western mind cannot escape the conditioning of logical thinking.  Any spiritualism from India is complex, ceremonial and not practical. Other sects of Buddhism generally do not have true comprehension, lost their way focusing on non-essentials etc. He reserves his most disparaging remarks for Indian religions and monks (and does his best to show that though Buddhism originated in India, it is really the Chinese and Japanese due to their practical nature made something of it).  Is this just the standard fundamentalism/ misplaced racism?  I will definitely read other books on Zen and go beyond this author.+books
Chasing Rubi: the Truth About Porfirio Rubirosa the Last Playboy+P+I have always had a fascination about Porfirio Rubirosa and this book makes me realize that he really was the Latin James Bond and an inspiration for the subsequent books and movies. The book contains truely interesting no where else to be found facts and is written in such an easy to read way. I think that anybody that has ever enjoyed a James Bond movie or book should read this book. I am sure that one day this book will be turned into a move+books
Terrific Book!+P+This is a great book.  It not only gives a feel for life after the end of the show DS9, but very creatively incorporates the time frames and characters from the eras of Dax's previous hosts.  E.g. Bomes makes an appearance. Highly recommended if you loved the Dax character, or Star Trek in general+books
Excellent, practical advice+P+I made the mistake of buying the first edition of this book (published in 2001), but found it to be an excellent guide to the legal issues involved with public domain textual material.  I have already published one book which relied heavily on public domain materials, and am working on a second, and when I bought this book I had several specific questions that I was trying to answer.  This book answered all of them, as well as some that I hadn't thought of!  I'll probably end up buying the second edition, just to see what has changed in the last few years+books
Shamela: Parodies-Unlike Their Originals-Are Read Only Once+P+Henry Fielding wrote SHAMELA for the best of all reasons: he needed the money. The fact that Richardson's earlier PAMELA had been begging for burlesque in its absurdities and pretensions can be seen only as a contributory reason. In his preface, Fielding makes it clear that he has placed Richardson's heroine squarely in his sights. He attempts to expose "the many notorious Falsehoods and Misrepresentations of a Book called Pamela, Are exposed and refuted; and all of the matchless Arts of that young Politician, set in a true and just Light." He makes it pretty clear that in the controversy as to whether Pamela's motivation for marrying the cad who tried mightily to seduce her are innocent or mercenary Fielding sees as the latter.   Like PAMELA, SHAMELA is a novel (much briefer than PAMELA) written as letters. But in Fielding's hands, Shamela is seen as the master manipulator. Where Pamela faints whenever her Mr. B. grabs her, Shamela swoons too-but in coarse delight. With each passing episode, Fielding inverts the moral universe of Richardson so that when one considers Richardson's subtitle of PAMELA as "Virtue rewarded," one now sees with crystal clarity that virtue does indeed earn a reward, but the virtue of Pamela and the virtue of Shamela are alike only in their spelling. I am glad that I read PAMELA first, for if I had come across SHAMELA first, I am pretty sure that I would have hooted and guffawed at a young innocent whose only crime was to follow on stage a deadly mimic.+books
Love Lor The Living  by  Dan Saferstein Phd+P+I was touched by the sensitivity, wisdom and honesty of the writer. While  written in an easy readable style, it's a book that goes to the core of  human needs and feelings:love,pain, understanding,belonging and other. I  appreciated Dr. Saferstein's approach to relationships often from the  woman's point of view.At times it seemed that it was a woman's voice  speaking to me. Reading about the writer's personal life, I found many  subtle lessons to apply to my own life. I found it uplifting that grief at  the death of his younger sister resulted in a new reawakaning to all the  things that were dear to him. It made me reflect on my relationships and  what was important to me in life+books
Starts slow but ends with an unexpected bang+P+Jonathan Kellerman has been one of my favorite authors for years, particularly the Alex Delaware novels.  This - non-Delaware novel - starts slow but delivers in the end.  The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is because of the slow beginning.  I even put it down a time or two thinking I'd never get where he was going, but I'm glad I persisted.  It turned out to be very well worth it.  This is an old fashioned cerebral murder mystery with our hero and amateur sleuth the psychologist doctor lover of the first victim.  Eh?  Got the hairs standing up?  He is befriended (in an odd circumscribed manner) by an older pathologist who invites him to dinner with friends one evening.  As the murders continue our hero begins receiving obscure clues - and he's not sure who to ascribe them to.  This is a well plotted, very satisfying read if you can make it through the - sorry - slow beginning.  Kellerman reveals a whole new side to his writing abilities in this deeply thoughtful mystery.  Loved it!+books
The Dark Side of the Croon+P+A wonderful portrait of the dashing, romantic Columbo. Virtually forgotten for the last half-century, Columbo was as popular as Bing Crosby in the early 1930s and considered a heart-throb on a par with actor Rudolph Valentino. But at age 26, he was shot and killed by his best friend in a freak accident, ending one of the most promising careers in music and film. Columbo was the archetypal 1930s "crooner," who gave "an impression of emotional restraint, of power in reserve." Despite the co-author credit, the book was in fact written by Lanza, a master wordsmith (and author of Elevator Music, The Cocktail, and Gravity). Penna supplied the copious archival photographs, letters and news clippings that beautifully augment the text. Lanza, who calls Columbo "an enigma wrapped inside a press release," treats his subject with respect, yet with a proper historical detachment that avoids hagiography. Columbo was as talented and charismatic as he was troubled, flawed, ambivalent, and stubborn, and Lanza makes no excuses for him. At the same time, the chronology is authoritative, and there's abundant humor, even when considering Columbo's inner torment (referring to Columbo's pet name for his adored Carole Lombard, Lanza refers to the singer's despair at not getting enough "quality Pookie time"). Lanza describing Columbo emerging from a swimming pool: "...a sight no less mythical than Venus rising from her half-shell. His dark eyes sparkled as the refracted sunlight grafted a halo around his wet hair, the water pouring like pearls of amniotic effluvia from a chlorinated incubator." Such vivid images tantalize on every page, but the book never bogs down in literary preciousness; it represents solid, well-researched journalism. Columbo's love letters to Lombard are revealing in their pathetic desperation, demonstrating that the adoration of a million wistful female fans cannot allay unrequited passion. An excellent read, and the cast of characters are richly drawn+books
Yea!  Good Book!+P+I really liked this book.  It was funny and well-written and all those things that you like in a book.  However, all of the reviews I read of this book said that Mary Anne was to blame, but I think Dawn was a little, too.  What I mean is, she wasn't very sympathetic to Mary Anne. Poor Mary Anne was moving into a brand-new house with a new family-a whole new lifestyle. And even though she had wanted to live with Dawn and wanted their parents to marry, any big change is hard.  I wish Dawn had seen that.  Oh, well. GREAT book!  Perfect for a funny read+books
Series crashes with third book - be warned+N+After reading the trilogy, I was left wondering what the hell happened? I have just read all 3 of the His Dark Materials trilogy and what was a strong start in book 1 and 2 is utterly demolished in this clunker.    Pullman allowed his eagerness to bash religion to completely destroy an engaging story - one of the most creative stories I've come across in 20 years of reading fantasy. There isn't even a remote chance of a sequel to fix up this mess. If you look up `anticlimax' in the dictionary, you'll see a picture of this book. From first page to last, time is wasted on boring characters, while all the good ones are either killed off, or just MIA for the entire book. Spoilers ahead.   What about Lyra and her parents? Somehow, she never knows what happened to them and after all she has been through is supposed to be content with going back to school like a good little girl? She never even confronts them to try and understand their motivations. And Will just goes back with Mary Malone to her apartment so they can figure out how to avoid the cops. Over a cup of tea, naturally. And that's it for him. In addition to all that, this book doesn't even seem to be connected to the first two. None of the characters resonate they way they used to and instead of being good friends, Will and Lyra fall in love and have sex at the tender age of 11 or 12 . . .  all in the last 30 pages. What happened to the story, for cripes sake?!  And what happened to the `temptation'? Was choosing not to stay with Will her way of not succumbing to it? The whole premise is just so lame to start out with. As an earlier reviewer pointed out all the windows that were opened for centuries didn't endanger the universe, why not leave one open for 60 or 70 years to give Lyra and Will a chance to know each other. The flimsy reasoning behind this is just as contrived as their sudden and immediate love for one another. Supposedly, they had more than gonads going for them, they survived death together!   Pullman didn't feel like thinking it through, he just wanted a gut wrenching ending. In addition to that, he wanted to mock the reader by taunting us with the `reality' of knowing that nothing they did in the trilogy has any hope or meaning. All of Will and Lyra's efforts are futile, kind of like - guess what? religion for the rest of us morons.   After having the reader go through endless pages on the mulefa-elephant aliens or whatever, ultimately the characters the reader wants to know about disappear with barely a whimper. Iorek Byrnison, Lee Scoresby - instead we get page after page about Mary Malone the Disaffected former Nun. Pullman all but pants in his eagerness to give the finger to anyone of us who believes in Him or anything for that matter!   This is NOT children's literature, it's a hate ridden manifesto that is more suitable for adults who at least have some way of maintaining some sort of perspective throughout this sloppy mess. It's totally dishonest to sell this as a children's book, or even as a competent work of fiction. All of the painstaking work of the first two books is undone with this one.   We never get closure on Lyra's parents. We never really understand what Dust is and where it comes from. We never see Will reunited with his mother. We get a lame battle where `god' dies and no one even knows why or how. Lyra and Will fall in love, but have to `sacrifice' it so that all the windows to other worlds can be shut forever, with only flimsy reasoning behind it. The mulefa and Mary Malone's work together amounts to nothing, everyone just goes home. Presumably, Will goes home, although we never see it. All that yearning after his mother and so forth . . .nothing. The major enemies are killed off too easily - and what about Armageddon? What happened to the Fortress and all the rebel angels and . . .you get the idea. It all just sort of disovles. Mary forgot to be the Serpent, or else I missed that in one of the countless pages on the mulefa.  Another reader pointed out: " Phillip Pullman could have written a masterpiece with this series. Instead, the story falls flat under the weight of the author's own agendas and mockeries. What a waste of time. I can't believe this book actually won awards. It stopped being thought-provoking and started being inane and silly."   It would have been better if Lyra had just awakened one morning and it was all a dream. Instead, relearning how to read the alethiometer will somehow enable her to build the Kingdom of Heaven in the course of her lifetime. Absurd. This was one of the most disappointing and infuriating reads of my life.+books
Eda Goldstein & Ego Psychology+P+Eda Goldstein does a great job of describing, in detail, Ego Psychology from a historical, theoretical, and practical perspective. I was particularly fond of Part II dealing with the ego and its functions and defenses. She writes with a clarity that is difficult to find when reading books dealing with detailed theoretical perspectives. I would highly recommend this book to socials workers and pyschologists alike. It is a wealth of information that you will find yourself referencing again and again+books

What You Didn't Know About Opium...+P+"Opium: A History" by Martin Booth is an engrossing work of nonfiction that details human reliance on opium for thousands upon thousands of years and how it has affected us physically, emotionally, economically, and morally.  The book starts with a discussion on the poppy flower itself and how opium is derived from the plant's sap and ending on the efforts of international traffickers, government enforcement agencies, and doctors alike in either expanding or eradicating addiction to opium.  In between, you will learn about opium's horrible effects on the body, Britain's establishment of the opium trade in China and later efforts to destroy it (counter to the rest of the world's reliance on opium to support their economies), the transformation of opium to heroin, the use of opium to inspire artists around the world, and the quiet and insidious opium trade that goes on with the permission of many governments to support war efforts and other international issues.  To me, the most fascinating thing I learned from this book was the amount of people addicted to the drug in the past because it was such an important painkiller/medicine and because it helped quiet fussy babies.  You can't help finish this book and wonder if it is even possible to win a war against a drug that has shaped the lives of so many humans and so many societies for thousands of years.  I personally found the book easy to read, though I preferred the first two-thirds of the book.  This part of the book covered the drug itself, its health affects, and its early history up to the nineteenth century.  I wasn't as interested in the international trafficking part of the book (the last one-third), probably because so many people, organizations, and countries were mentioned that I lost track of which country was fighting who and who was doing what with heroin or opium.  Still, the book is an eye-opening read.  The excruciating description of opium withdrawal should be mandatory reading for high school kids to help stymie any attempt at trying the drug.+books
Excellent Book+P+I have been in music industry business for a while now and I would recommand this piece of art to anyone who's new and seriously wants to become familiar with this industry.  Whether you're an artist or manager, this book will help you to understand the basics.  I also like the fact that the authors are so honest and give you a real piece of advice if you want to be a successful artist manager, and that is to get education (especially in business).  As a recent business graduate it has helped me to be a lot more successful in this industry+books
Multilevel marketing meets education+N+I had to purchase this book for a community college class I'm taking.  As a "textbook," it has been a complete disappointment.  The "science" is sketchy, the research is shoddy, and the huge holes in logic are brushed over with explanations like "you can't prove nearly anything empirically in education" (straight from page 8!).  Some of the concepts presented are interesting, but  since Mr. Jensen (no, he doesn't hold a doctorate) provides almost no citations for his claims, there is no way to check his assertions or determine where the theories come from.  The book reads like a multilevel marketing sales pitch.  In fact, you are encouraged to share it with your friends and colleagues and are directed to a website where you could empty your bank account getting "certified" in Mr. Jensen's unique, "empirically unproven" techniques+books

Easy Boat Building Concepts thoroughly explained+P+I have read this book several times.  He has a clear and logical way of presenting the stages of construction.  His web site is informative and his video is equally as instructive.  In terms of a complete "How to" series, I only wish other disciplines were as good.  In addition to the quality of his construction, I am particularly fond of his designs.  Most other stitch and glue plans lack the elegance of Sam's designs+books
bible+P+really like the book its about time this type of bible came out, Iam not a believing christian and read it for its literary art. A great book of myth and delusion It is interesting to read thoughts from ancient mind+books
THis book was amazing!+P+I was visiting Russia this summer, staying with the grandparents of one of my friends. There was one shelf of books in English in the room where I stayed, and The Mind Parasites was one of them - I read it in one day, I could not put it down! It was just an amazing book! And since no one who lives in the home where I stayed speaks or reads English, I could have easily just brought the book home with me, but I thought &quot;oh no, I'll just buy my own copy when I get home.&quot;  Now I'm kicking myself, HARD.  I had no idea the book would be out of print and hard to find!  The copy I read was nice, too.  Whoever owned it took good care of their books.  I'm seriously thinking of writing to a friend over there and asking him to go over to the house I stayed in, and get the book so he can send it to me+books
Predictable+N+I love Koontz; however, this was not his best effort. The book was almost boring+books
If you want a bigger paycheck, read this book!+P+I owe my latest payday to Jack Chapman's negotiating strategies. My newest employer aimed pretty low for their first offer, lower than what I had made at my last job, considering all of the skills and experience I was bringing to the table. But by applying some of the techniques in the book, I was able to get 22% more money. I've never negotiated my salary before: I was just glad someone thought enough of my skills to make me an offer. Now, I know better+books
Great Educational Resource!+P+I bought this book for our store reference.  My staff became hooked, the information is solid and written in a way that reads like a book built for leisure. One critique;  There could be more pictures in her book, although a cliche - a picture is worth a thousand (descriptive) words.  I will buy more books from Ms Matlins, she has established herself as THE DEFINITIVE WRITER for gems and pearls.  Thanks for the great reading material.  Veronica, Ali'i Jewelry - Hawai+books
De Bono will make you THINK+P+Every so often you read a book that is so obvious that you are amazed you did not see it before. For me, this is such a book. Yes, I could argue about the slow nature of the book, about the style or choice of phrase. However, the very simple idea (singular) at the core hit me like a billiard ball between the eyes at three paces.  De Bono takes the idea of thinking, and breaks it down into six different aspects, and proposes that all should be allowed at appropriate times in a meeting. The key is not that (say) raw emotion can be expressed unjustified, but that where necessary such feelings are not only encouraged, but that it is an everybody thing. Participants are allowed to express a simple yes / no to an idea with no further comments. This, by the way, is `red hat thinking'.  Each aspect of thinking is given a colour, so participants will wear the SAME hat at the same time, to view topics from a similar perspective. There is no compelling reason to have physical hats, but presumably this may help initially. Examining each proposal in a critical way is allowed, but not all the way through any discussion - only at `blackhat' time.  This is a short, easy-read book. It would be possible to give a summary here of the six hats, and their meanings - however, it is better to let de Bono do that. Chapters are small and bite-sized, with an introduction and summary to each coloured hat. You do not need to read the book in one sitting, but it is probably advisable to tackle the 170 pages within 2 or 3 days.  The author has written a number of other books on `thinking', and these are referred to in the text of the volume. For me, the references were about right - neither too many (a sales pitch) or too few (not giving readers the opportunity to get further information). What did irritate me was the summary chapters for each hat, where the majority of sentences seemed to begin with e.g. "Blue hat thinking .....".  At the end de Bone gives a possible framework for using the principles within a meeting. This is helpful, and adds to the comments and examples throughout the text. The overall feel is that this is a book about thinking that is based in reality.    My final thoughts concern interminable meetings I have attended, and national flags. Use of the core idea of this thin volume would have saved man-months of my time, sometimes concluding that a meeting was not necessary. The national flag theme? Take a South African flag into meetings with you. This will remind you of the thinking hats, for the colours are the same.  Buy it, learn it, practice it, and do it.

A Real Page Turner+P+I can remember telling people to leave me alone in the lunch room as I read through the final quarter of this book. While this book does feature some Hannibal Lecter moments, it is more centered around the search for a serial killer, with Hannibal once again providing the 'consultant' role. The movie did a fairly sucessful job with this up until the end, which was saddening; The ending in this book is quite a powerhouse, although similar in them. This is a very compelling read whether you are a horror fan or crime fan. There is alot of technical forensic stuff here and there, but it works well as you follow the closing in on a really sick guy. The romance element here is quite strong and tragic; It provides a nice distraction from the constant tension you feel throughout these pages. I was very impressed with this book, and it had me hanging on every last word. I can't imagine anyone who likes this kind of stuff feeling any differently+books
Just not enough...VERY VERY Basic!+N+I bought this book, hoping it would go farther than getting into the "front door" of DMing.  I kept reading, telling myself, no it is going to go into depth, it is going to hit on some substance, but it never did.   It spends too much of its time, focusing on the "dummy" concept.  It repeats itself over and over again, stating "you are the DM, you are the one that runs the game".  Yes I know that, now get on with the book, I kept saying!  If you are a totally new DM, then this book will be helpful.  If you have run a game, a couple of times, then you have probably already figured out all of the concepts mentioned here.+books

Worth the payoff at the end+P+Before I read the last 100 pages of this book, I would have given it 3 stars.  Woken Furies suffers from a common affliction among many sci-fi series: same-samey-ness.  Once you're introduced to the world, the technologies, the aliens, whatever, unless the author can keep the creative curve balls coming (Peter Hamilton often has the ability to keep things fresh), the joy and surprise of discovery quickly fades.  And so it goes with Woken Furies.  Two thirds of the way through and I thought Harlan's World just wasn't different enough from Venice Beach to keep me riveted.  And assembling the deCom team, going into battle, using the cybertech - I might as well have been re-reading Broken Angels, Morgan's best by far.   BUT!  Just when I was resigned my disappointment, the last few chapters cranked the book out of its nose dive.  Morgan lets loose with some Big Ideas, and the final showdown is spectacular fun.  Sci-fi writers often have problems ending their books (Stephenson, Gibson anyone?), but Morgan always ends with a satisfying crunch, and this one wrapped up the nicest of them all.  A word of warning - this is by far the most violent book I have ever read, and that includes Morgan's previous books.  If you can't take the heat, stay out of the kitchen.  And Morgan's graphic sex scenes seem gratuitous and perfunctory to the point of being boring porn.   In Morgan's favor, as usual his prose is taut as a drum and hits hard.  Characterization has always been his strong point, and this is perhaps his best: Kovacs's anger seethes off every page.  The self-loathing loose cannon may be a cliché, but with Kovacs you can feel it, to the point where character is basically a psychotic serial-killer, and you're right there with him. I think Morgan was wise to retire Kovacs with this novel.  One more and the sameyness would have made the series a bore.  (I've given up on Hamilton and Reynolds for that reason - I get it already.)  If you're a fan of the Kovacs books, this is definitely worth some tedium (albeit entertaining tedium) to get to the payoff.  I'm looking forward to what Morgan will do next+books
For the politically-oriented teen+P+David Levithan's newest novel, "Wide Awake," is a political novel set "in the near future." Here's the set up:  "The Greater Depression happened. The events of 3/12 and 7/23 happened. The Andreas Quake and Hurricane Wanda. The President launched his War to End All Wars, which only managed to create more wars and the tragic events of 4/5. The Greater Depression deepened. Millions of people died, and there was no way to erase their faces from the more renegade open news channels, which wanted to remind everyone how bad the government had let things get. The Decents and their program of Denial Education reached their peak."  The hero and narrator of "Wide Awake" is a Jewish, gay teen named Duncan who is engaged politically for the first time in his life. After all the troubles of his childhood and the generation(s) before, it seems as if a new era is on the horizon. His presidential candidate, Abraham Stein, a Jewish gay man with a partner and children, has been elected. People are behaving differently, celebrating their ethnic, cultural, and sexual differences. And supporting them all is a sizable group of Jesus Freaks.  "For the Jesus Revolutionaries, the answer was clear: Jesus would not be out waging "preventative" wars. Jesus would not be withholding medicine from people who could not afford it. Jesus would not cast stone at people of races, sexual orientations, or genders other than his own. Jesus would not condone the failing, viperous, scandal-plagued hierarchy of some churches. Jesus would welcome everyone to his table. He would love them, and he would find peace."  Sounds like a utopian novel so far, right? But there's a hitch. A hitch in the form of Kansas. Stein's election is being contested. To the tune of 1,000 votes. (Sound familiar?) Stein calls all his supporters to Kansas and Duncan and his friends head to Topeka to support their candidate.  While "Wide Awake" is a political novel, Levithan does not abandon the everyday. Duncan struggles in his relationship with gorgeous Jimmy, teachers can be kind or belligerent, parents are sometimes more conservative than you'd like, and friends take sides in everyday breakups. But, in the end, Levithan's message is one of hope. People can be good and good people can change even the worst-case scenario into a better present and future.  "Wide Awake" is for older teens, ages 15 and up.+books
Beautiful pictures and words+P+I have a 6 month old daughter and she loves this book!  The colors are bright but not too busy and the words flow easily.

Obscure the Truth+N+"Let us be willing to test our spiritual experiences and evangelistic practices by Scripture," Pastor Will Metzger implores (51). Regrettably, Pastor Metzger was loathe to follow his own sound advice, opting instead to test his and the rest of Christendom's spiritual experiences and evangelistic practices by the standards laid down so long ago in the Westminster Confession of Faith (1646). And that is the main reason this latest revised and expanded edition of his ironically titled Tell The Truth (Downers Grove, Ill.: InterVarsity Press, 2002) remains a wealth of hyper-Calvinistic misinformation.       Twenty-one years after the first printing of Tell The Truth (hereafter, TTT), Pastor Metzger remains deeply troubled that increasingly cynical Christendom is still attempting to evangelize the unbelieving world by showing only the attractive parts of the gospel message, and as a result are creating a vast army of God-damned (literally) pseudo-converts. Pastor Will, who began his career as a campus minister on the staff of InterVarsity Christian Fellowship at the University of Delaware the same year Sir Winston Churchill departed for his eternal reward (1965), believes a return to "biblical evangelism" can reverse the curse of "me-centered" evangelism (38). And so TTT attempts to remedy the current sorry situation by explaining fully the content of the gospel (part 1: pp. 23-86); insuring that gospel message converts intellect, emotions, and will, i.e. the entire soul (part 2: pp. 87-111); explaining proper Calvinistic soteriology (part 3: 112-158); and learning how to competently defend and communicate the faith (part 4: 159-207). If for some reason the reader feels the need to have the main points of TTT rehearsed and/or get some idea how they might be put to good use in the real world, Pastor Metzger offers appendixes A-D (pp. 208-259).         In Pastor Metzger's considered (read: Reformed Church tradition) opinion, the numerous miracles performed by 1st century A.D. evangelists in the book of Acts may be hanged, because there are really only two ways to proclaim Christ: "The airplane of Christian witness has two wings: our lives (conduct) and our lips (conversation)" (25). Strangely, Pastor Metzger offers no scriptural reference(s) to buttress this rather sweeping claim. The omission is particularly glaring given the bitterness of the complaint he voices in TTT's introductory chapter: "Why is there such reticence to examine the biblical basis for methods of witness (especially if they are the ones our church uses)?" (17). The irony is already palpable.       Just a few pages later Pastor Metzger folds and tucks away one of his two wings of Christian witness, observing that numerous religious persuasions and philosophies will also produce positive, observable changes in conduct capable of impressing others (28). But a few pages later the wing is reopened by Pastor Metzger, who now declares new converts may safely conclude they are truly saved when "they see the fruits of a changing life" (38). Fine.       Pastor Metzger next reminds that "in the book of Acts we see the apostles as teachers--reasoning, persuading, explaining--involved in all sorts of teaching activity in order to communicate as much truth as possible to nonbelievers" (34). Unfortunately Pastor Metzger omits the fact that secularists, Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses, and numerous other cult leaders are also actively engaged as teachers--reasoning, persuading, explaining--involved in all sorts of teaching activity in order to communicate as much "truth" as possible to nonbelievers. The all-important difference is that unlike these false witnesses of God, the apostles were able to perform many wonders and signs (Acts 2:43). Those signs and wonders authenticated the apostles' divine bona fides, just as they had previously authenticated Jesus Christ's divine bona fides, and the divine bona fides of the true prophets' of the OT before him.        (Where exactly in the NT did Pastor Metzger read that God would go into semi-retirement immediately after giving the apostle John a revelation of the future? Where?)       Pastor Metzger spends the rest of part one differentiating between "me-centered evangelism," i.e., spreading Christianity by emphasizing the many personal benefits that will attend salvation, and "biblical evangelism," i.e. five-point Calvinism. "Conversion is both a turning from and a turning toward" Pastor Metzger insists (67-68). "Both law and love are basic ingredients in telling the gospel story" Pastor M. admonishes (71). Consciences need to be pricked. People must be made to understand that they do not have proprietary rights to their own lives, God does.       Pastor M. is not keen on encouraging new converts to make a public confession of their faith, ala Romans 10:9-10. He thinks they should be left alone to meditate on Scriptures like Isaiah 53, Psalm 51, and Galatians 2:20 (76). Apparently never having read Acts 16:31 or Philippians 2:11, Pastor M. declares "There is not one exhortation in Scripture to `accept Christ as Lord,'" (77).       On page 79 Pastor M. lists three ways to know you are saved. The first is when you "trust in the promises of God as being promises to you." The second is "a change in your attitude and actions corresponding to the fruit of the Spirit (Gal 5) and the marks of salvation (1 Jn)" (Pastor M. ignores his earlier observation that New Agers can also experience profound attitude changes). The third assurance of salvation is "the inner witness of God's Spirit to your spirit." Pastor M. does not unpack that statement, leaving it to the reader to exegete what he will from it. By marked contrast, the gospel writer Mark recorded Jesus' decidedly different criteria for determining who is saved:   And these signs will accompany those who believe: In my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues; they will pick up snakes with their hands; and when they drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them at all; they will place their hands on sick people, and they will get well. (16:17-18).       Part two tries to distinguish professors of Christianity from possessors of same in order to increase more of the latter. Conversion is a process, not an event Pastor M. cautions. Christianity is not a self improvement plan; it is God's method for restoring you to fellowship with Him. Converts need "to ask God for faith," since "they are not choosing to be saved" (91). Pastor M. then presents a short, biased analysis of the age-old Arminian-Calvinism debate on soteriology, concluding that the five points of Calvinism are "orthodox theology ... in need of further filling out" (109).        Part three, "Wholly by Grace," is largely a continuation of the Calvinist rant begun in part two. Pastor M. admits the arbitrary election of a relative handful to heaven and the overwhelming majority to hell is not fair, but hey, God is sovereign, and He would have been justified to throw everyone in hell, not just almost everyone. Humanity's free will has been disabled by sin, and now it cannot choose anything but sin (if that is true, and doing right is not an option, how could sin then be termed a "choice?"). "God hides the truth from some people. He doesn't reveal himself or Jesus to them. Why (Lk 10:21-22)?" (146). Pastor M. misinterprets that passage in Luke to mean intelligent people are tricked into unbelief by a vengeful or capricious God, as opposed to them being deserving victims of their own misplaced self-confidence.       Part four begins by enumerating some of the difficulties philosophical pluralism creates for successful evangelism. Pastor M. defends Christian exclusivity by referring to John 14:6: Jesus answered, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me."  Pastor M. ignores the fact that Jesus' comments were offered to his own disciples at a private gathering, not addressed to the masses in general during a public sermon.       Pastor M. observes all religious faiths save Christianity require its adherents "to do something" (165). Pastor M. apparently has not noticed that repenting, confessing, baptizing, trusting, etc., are verbs.       Pastor M. believes the evangelistic value of Christian apologetics is limited. "God's chosen instrument in conversion is His Word, not our reasoning ability" (169). In that case we can only pity that great swath of humanity that was never taught how to read, or could never afford to purchase a copy of Scripture, or never had the Word translated into their native tongue.       Pastor M. soon changes his mind about God's chosen instrument in conversion. "Prayer for others is the supreme God ordained method in evangelism" (178) As usual, Pastor M. offers no scriptural support for his emphatic, sweeping statement. He goes on to say "evangelism is asking the right questions" (189), but once again cites no NT anecdote to support his contention. Besides asking all the right questions, the Christian evangelist also needs to make sure an unbeliever understands "the impossibility of ... exercising faith on their own" (203). Fine.       In summary, Tell The Truth proffers a pneumatology, a soteriology, and a strategy for evangelism that seems alien to those described in the book of Acts. When all is said and done, TTT is hoisted by its own petard: "... to be unwilling to evaluate our evangelism in the light of the Bible is to not take Scripture seriously" (19).+books
An Absolute Classic+P+Written by Frank Miller and hauntingly illustrated by David Mazzucchelli, YEAR ONE was serialized in Batman #404-407.  It tells of the first calendar year in which Batman emerged in Gotham City, beginning with Bruce Wayne returning to Gotham after studying martial arts abroad. Wayne becomes a vigilante, at first without the Batman outfit, at first fumbling a bit.  The sequence in which he conceives of the outfit takes the old cliché from Batman history of a bat crashing through the window and transforms it into a moving moment; YEAR ONE gives similar treatment to flashbacks showing the murder of Wayne's parents.  In a city dominated by gangsters before the ascent of insane costumed criminals, Batman encounters Catwoman, here depicted as a whore who takes to the street with frustrations about gender, her sadomasochistic elements heightened.  James Gordon becomes a fully-realized character for the first time, adjusting from his move from Chicago to Gotham, where the police force is dominated by corruption.  He investigates Batman, suspects Wayne, has an affair, and ultimately has his child kidnapped and rescued by the vigilante he sought to bring down.  In a tough city, he goes from crusader against Batman to the first stages of his relationship with Batman.  A masterful work, BATMAN:  YEAR ONE possesses a level of realism greater than perhaps any Batman tale and, with a breakneck pace, does the hard work of describing the humble beginnings of Batman's career, performing in the process a remarkable process of infusing Bruce Wayne, James Gordon, and Selina Kyle with true character, personality, and history.  This is the second best Batman story ever made, second only (perhaps) to THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS.  -- Julian Darius, Sequart.com (for sophisticated study of comic books and graphic novels+books
Better Than Barron's+P+Whether you've already used up the previous two Spanish guides in the Practice Makes Perfect Series (Spanish Verb Tenses, and Spanish Pronouns and Pronouns), or this is your introduction, this workbook is as good as it gets for the intermediate to advanced student of Spanish who wants to keep learning beyond the classroom. Complete Spanish Grammar has it all--friendly, down-to-earth language, exercises that could have been taken right out of Hispanic shops and streets and living rooms, and explanations of grammar components that actually make sense.  I don't know how many times I've heard the exact phrases I just saw in the workbook while walking down the streets of Mexican towns. And since it's soft-cover, it's easy to take with you and work with while traveling. Hey, at $10.95, you can even afford to buy and extra one to keep in the car.    +books
just another heresy+N+Open theism is just another form of Socininism that exists to avoid predestination. Sinful man longs to be master of his fate and the determiner of future events. Thus the theology that God wills as man wills. God is man's toady and his task is to bring hapiness and success to his creatures. In return,maybe sinners will give him some love. So let all men be liars,and God be true+books
Women good, men bad+N+Women in America are so fun to be with, so wonderful, and so full of life, it's sad the men in this country haven't taken notice of them.  This book points the finger where it is needed most - at the menfolk!  While we do face a 43% divorce rate and a 17% separation rate in this country with 65+% of those divorces and separations initiated by the wives of those marriages, and women are overwhelmingly favored to receive alimony and child support over men in family court, this should be of no concern to men.  Oh, and also if you have a woman in your home or are married to her for a short while, you may be liable for a huge amount of palimony or alimony.  Oh, and evidentiary due process is not required for you to be convicted of domestic violence in family court.  You may end up losing your children, house, bank account and freedom if your wife decides she is bored and wants to "move on".  Uhhh, never mind...+books
I Love This Book+P+Nicola writes in such a spare and poetic style that she must capture the imagination of each child who reads it, or has it read to her. She offers facts about this bat breed as she weaves her story, and topped with delicate artwork, it's just perfect+books
Colors and Shapes+P+The Colors and Shapes book is a very useful tool for learning the basics of Spanish. If you want something that is easy to read and understand, this is your book. From reading this book, I think anyone would be able to learn the basic colors and shapes in both English and Spanish. My favorite part was the last page which was a picture of a colorful room full of shapes. This was a good exercise to wrap up the book and apply the words that I learned. A child would be able to use this book, and others like it in the series, to learn and then apply knowledge in every day life when seeing colors and shapes of any kind. This book doesn't just stick to simple shapes such as circle and square, but also includes words for diamond, sphere, and cone.+books
Wast of Money+N+It is because of this book and the other books James Fetzer wrote with his dishonest pack, that people have lost so much interest in the JFK Assassination. Honest authors like Harold Weisberg and David Wrone attract less attention because they only published what they could prove and not what they dream up. The Z-film was altered, many know this, the Warren Commission published it in volume 18 (18H1-84) with frames missing. In case you don't know this, that counts as alteration. Z-film tampering was not to the extent that Fetzer claims such as painting Jackie's face on the film itself. The film was not stolen, or doctored up in anyway. No one would be dumb enough to take that risk+books
Close to useless+N+This book does not include plates of birds that are included in Peterson Field Guides from Western North America, Eastern North America or Texas. So, unless you have their guide books memorized for these locations, the Mexico guide book is basically useless. Alternatively, you could buy all four books  (Eastern NA, Western NA, Texas, and Mexico) and carry them all with you. Or you could just purchase a different, stand-alone guide book with plates of the most or all of the birds in the region.+books
Essence of Buddhism+P+Excellent foreword by Joe Miller not mentioned in information. These sutras give you the essence of Buddhism not the trappings. Essential for someone wanting to know the real thing. If you find the meaning of these sutras you are on your way to nowhere with nothin+books
Endless Plotting+N+I'm a big fan of Shogun (4 1/2 stars) and Tai-Pan (4 stars) and expected much of the same here.  But after 450 pages I gave up.  Plot, subplot, sub-subplot, sub-sub-subplot, scores of characters.  I got tired of starting another chapter with a new plot angle, when I was ready for development and resolution of what came before.  This book picks up with the Straun/Brock rivalry from Tai-Pan after an interval of 120 years.  I wanted that history filled-in (including the remaining three coins), but there was little of that in what I read.   The writing is still good and I may have been impatient to quit after only a third of the book, but I had to move on to something more satisfying+books
Leonardo Da Vinci for Kids : His Life and Ideas.+N+This book was selected as a biography for a 5th grader. Both my child and I felt the book was too cluttered with side bars of historical events and distracting projects. Trying to find information about Da Vinci's life proved elusive. There was no infomation on his childhood, but most  glaringly was the lack of information about his skills as a mathematician  or astromner.  The focus was on his artistic ability, yet there were few  pictures of his most famous works. The book did provide infomation, but in  a rather boring and cluttered manner. This book is satisfactory as  secondary reference. My child, an avid reader, did not enjoy this book. He  said it was not for kids+books
Racist, Misogynist, and Dated+N+These writings seem quaint and offensive by today's standards. These are wholly disappointing stories from a mediocre writer, like a second-rate Steinbeck. Cooper seems completely in love with his meal ticket, but I doubt this collection will draw any new admirers+books
Enough+N+Martha Grimes has had a good thing going with the Richard Jury series, until now.  Bizarre is too interesting a word to use for this book.  More like muddled, drawn out, and difficult.  The story within a story is an intriguing idea, but it went nowhere.  The plot is weak, the characters' actions unbelievable, and the ending disappointing.  I have enjoyed reading this series, but to be honest, this book was a waste of time.  I think it's time for Jury, Plant, and pals to be put to rest.  +books
entertaining academic mystery +P+Maggie is a professor of history at Somerset County Community College, but she toils during her time off working on her antique business where she specializes in rare prints.  Right now Maggie is attending a social function being given by Dorothy and Oliver Whitcomb, major contributors to the college and the moving force behind Whitcomb House, a dormitory for unwed single parents and their children.  The six lively students have their fees, book and any incidentals including childcare paid for.  The six students are also at the party but Sarah becomes ill and falls into a coma; she is rushed to the hospital where the doctors discover she was poisoned.  They believe there was nicotine in the spicy drink she was having.  A couple of days later another student is poisoned and is found in the House by one of the children.  Tiffany was wilder than Sarah was and some of the mothers believe she was blackmailing someone.  The case becomes personal when Maggie's office is trashed and someone tries to break into her home.  To save Whitcomb House Maggie decides to see if she can discover who the killer really is.  SHADOWS ON THE IVY is very different from the other "Antique Mystery" book because this story concentrates on the heroine's life as a professor while the other works showcased the protagonist as an antique print dealer.  Thus, this novel displays a completely different side of Maggie that readers will like.  Lea Wait has written an exciting and entertaining academic mystery that provides a whole different meaning to study time.  Harriet Klausner +books
Invaluable!+P+I was in search of a good figure drawing book with an emphasis on animation and comics and this one caught my eye. After reading through, practicing the techniques and understanding them, I'm convinced that this is the most invaluable book I have in my large collection of art books.  This book completely changed the way I draw. I've been drawing seriously for roughly 10 years and once the ideas in this book clicked, it made me feel as if I'd been drawing the wrong way for all those years. Well worth the 17 bucks or whatever it was I payed for it.  I wouldn't recommend this book to beginners however. It's not really a how to draw or a book that covers basic proportion and anatomy issues. For somebody to get the most out of this book, I think they'd need to have a solid grasp on anatomy and fundamental drawing techniques. On the other hand, a beginner may benefit from this book simply from a gesture standpoint.  Easily a 5 out of 5 for me+books
Bestseller?!?!?!?!?!?!!!!!!+N+I had to read this book for my highschool literature class. Now I enjoy reading a good book now and then but the only reason that this is a bestseller is that all highschools across america must buy the book for summer reading every year. This book put me to sleep. The only reason this book gets two stars is because of the Trojan War chapter which I wished was longer. It was rich in detail and made you want to keep reading, unlike the rest of the book. I only recommend this book if you have to for a school class but other than that don't waste your time+books
I HATED IT+N+I JUST DIDN'T LIKE THIS BOOK. I WANTED TO PUT IT DOWN AND NOT PICK IT UP EVER AGAIN, BUT ONCE I START READING A BOOK I HAVE TO FINSH IT. FIRST SHE WAS TRYING TO RUN AWAY FROM HER PAST, THEN I DONT KNOW WHY HER HUSBAND STAYED WITH HER. SHE MADE ME SICK AND I LIKED HER SISTER MORE THAN HER. I WAS KIND OF HOPING THAT HER HUSBAND WOULD HAVE LEFT HER FOR HER SISTER INSTEAD OF STAYING WITH HER. ERIC JEROME DICKEY HAS BEEN SLIPPING IN HIS LAST FEW BOOKS I HOPE THE NEXT TWO COMING OUT THIS YEAR WILL BE BETTER. ASHLEY+books
Mediocre but solid+N+I consider this to be your typical run of the mill NLP book. It's solid in its approach, addresses the key pieces and is well written. But it doesn't stand out+books
A Tour de Force of Roman Epic+P+The book gives a thorough insight into the making of the most ambitious remaking of Roman epic in the 21st century Hollywood crowd of sci-fi movies. The pictures and the conceptual sketches really give additional values to the book in satisfying the artistic curiosity of the movie fans. The only drawback is that they didn't put in the complete shooting script a la other pictorial Newmarket movie books+books
Lord Jim: Through Many Prisms Darkly+P+LORD JIM is the story of an ordinary man who commits what may or may not be an act of cowardice and spends the rest of his life trying to atone for his sin.  What makes this story extraordinary is the difficulty the reader has assessing the nature of the original act and then judging whether Jim has been punished enough.  Joseph Conrad does not make it easy to gauge accurately either the man or his act since we can see the act filtered only through the lens of a narrator who is too close to the case to be judged reliable.  LORD JIM is a novel of adventure and many read it on that basis, but lurking beneath the surface of a simple act is, as in so much of Conrad's fiction, a bewildering complexity of issues that tap into the deepest recesses of why people do what they do and how others can fairly judge them.  Marlow is the narrator who attends the trial of a crewman Jim accused of abandoning his ship during a storm when he thought it was sinking. When all the ship's officers leap into a lifeboat they abandon the more than eight hundred passengers below decks. Jim joins them, and all are later picked up by a French trawler only to learn that their ship did not sink and in fact was safely towed to port.  All the officers, except Jim, escape punishment either by running away or pleading illness.  Only Jim decides to speak out publicly in his defense, but of course there is none, so he is found guilty and stripped of his seaman's certificate as punishment.  Marlow sees the trial and decides to follow Jim around the world to get the truth. These are the bald facts, but what Conrad does with them is to invest them with emotional and psychological issues that resist easy analysis.   To begin with, Conrad emphasizes Jim's ordinary state of being, by repeating that Jim is "one of us." This statement occurs so often that it becomes a mantra, inviting speculation as to what sense he is one of us. Whoever the "us" is, Conrad implies that the "us" must have had a standard of justice in which one size fits all.  No one at the board of inquiry seems particularly upset that Jim was merely following the captain's orders to abandon ship nor that his record was otherwise flawless. The board judged Jim by an inflexible code of honor and found him wanting. Conrad, in his description of Jim as a maritime Everyman (no first name, a flat character who no past, present, and now no future), makes it easy to condemn the board's overhasty verdict to condemn Jim for an act that had mitigating circumstances.  As Marlow gets to know Jim, he acknowledges that the more he knows, the less he understands.  Conrad sets up a straw man in Jim. Because so many people, including Marlow, hold Jim under so many lenses, the images that result are often contradictory.  The only constant is Jim himself.  During the trial, and later during the climactic encounter with the natives who call him Lord Jim, Jim continues to attempt to see himself in the simplest manner possible. He knows that he cannot possibly be all the Jims floating on everyone's lips, so he determines to be the Jim who should have stayed on board the deck of a sinking ship.  This Jim is willing to take responsibility for his actions.  When he unwisely allows the dastardly Gentleman Brown to escape his richly deserved fate, he makes a colossal leap of faith: he will pay now for all sins of his past.  In his death, Conrad suggests that this leap of faith may be the only trait that distinguishes reprobates like Brown from ordinary men like Jim who may not be so ordinary after all.+books
Nothing New +N+I bought this book thinking that it might be more than the usual time line history that so many other writers have produced. I was bitterly disappointed. Nothing new to add to the history of the band and really quite a bland read. As someone who knows that there was more to the 'lads' than what has been previously written, I was expecting more insight into their lives, more accurate information, and basically just MORE. The title of the book is quite misleading, as the only Babylon that seemed to go on was Tam's alledged chasing of Pat around hotel rooms and one recalled incident of Les and a mate hiding 2 groupies on a freezing balcony. If you know anything about the Rollers, you don't need to buy this book in hopes of learning more. It simply isn't there. A huge disappointment for this long time Roller fan. +books
The Westing Game+N+I am reading the book "The Westing Game" and I say that this book absolutely awful.  The book has very little details, and the plot is oh, so boring, and I never like this before. The characters names are pointlessly appropriate such as "Crow", "Turtle', and "Uncle Sam". The scenery is bad, and I could imagine better places. The ending was also absolutely terrible in all ways ever. I would rather drink tea from a gutter then read this book again.  The book starts as a pointless scenario and progress to a field of writing horror. I think the author had a huge writers block, and wrote down what ever she could think of first. I don't now how, but Newbery Award. I would have slapped a biohazard sticker to the book just to so how I really think of this book. My summary is that this book is extremely terrible, and should be destroyed. +books
Great book+P+This is a great book for anyone who wants to enhance their walk with Christ.  If you want to study deeper, there is a study guide that goes with this book.  Great for small group discussions+books
Not that great+N+Not all sections are included.  Only one or two solutions per section.  Very rarely they'll have an extra sentence or so of explanation, but that's about it+books
Fun with construction paper creations+P+Cut-Paper Play is an excellent collection of over 80 kid-approved construction paper creations for children ages 4 to 10. The projects are grouped by 3 different skill and difficulty levels. A variety of techniques  is shown. All you need is different kinds of paper or cardboard, scissors,  glue, sometimes yarn or a stapler. So the crafts are inexpensive, but very  amazing. Two- and  three-dimensional projects, mobiles and seasonal  projects are shown. We got inspiration for many more paper projects for the  future+books
Beautiful, but...?+P+I am a recent subscriber to the magazine, so I was drawn to the book by it's truly AMAZING photos.  The garden definitions at the beginning of each section were a nice addition, too.  I do wish, however, it had just a BIT  more content.  It is inspiring to leaf through, and dream+books
Assumes you already know quark terminology+N+This isn't an introductory book on quarks. It assumes you already know the terminology. What is spin? What is isospin? The glossary at the back isn't helpful. I read 20 or so pages and then realized it wasn't an oversight... He really has no plans to introduce these and other basic terms and explain them. Very disappointing+books
Creepy+N+This is a beautiful but creepy book: a lost sheep all alone, terrified by UFOs no less into fleeing into a strange, deserted home, is not my ideal bedtime reading for a sensitive child. The strong colors are beautiful and a nice change from baby-pastel, but they are also ominous and deterring. His utter solitude, in exploring the house (creepy corridor with blood-colored doors), eating, and finally sleeping, is horrifying to a child with imagination, whose most overriding terror is abandonment. I give it points for beauty and originality, none for sensitivity to the needs of its target audience, and cannot recommend it+books
Entertaining read+P+I was in the mood for an fast entertaining read, and this book filled the bill. Actually, I read it years ago, and recently re-read it.  It's suspenseful with a nice touch of romance.  I am not going to argue with other posters who say the characters were not fleshed out or the plot was unbelievable.  I enjoyed the story and the resourcefulness of the characters, and the constant sense of impending danger.  I wasn't looking for a literary exploration of the human condition, just a fun read with likable characters and a fast-paced plot, and this is it+books
Been better books by Seuss....+N+This is an interesting Seuss book. The moral that it is trying to portray is good, but the story is pretty lame and it doesn't seem to flow as nicely as most Seuss books+books
Disappointing+N+It has nothing but pre-published photos we have all seen before in magazines. The tats aren't even shown. They talk about how Angelina has a lot of them but they don't even list them all. Not made for the true tattoo enthusist. A coffee table book at best. It describes their crazy childhoods more than the tats+books
Tempting Tropicals is a horticultural tour de force...+P+Tempting Tropicals is a horticultural tour de force, packed with detailed information about growth habits, propagation tips, and the soil, temperature and light requirements of more than eight score tropical plants.  The fascinating, well written text is ornamented with full color photographs of these exotic beauties that marvelously display each plant's unique attributes. The superb text and photos are presented with the exacting production values that the publisher is well known for in the gardening community.  This book is a must for all real phytophiles+books
A peak at the past...and present+P+What a treat to have this updated version of the author's classic history of Boston. The photos still resonate with the sadness of their loss and the beauty of their existence. But this isn't just a coffee table book. It remains the best history of this fascinating old, and new, city. I especially liked the supplement telling what had been saved, what was threatened and what was lost. I bought the first version 20 years ago and have bought the second to give to the next generation in my household to say how cities grow and should grow. A splendid book+books
Simply Amazing+P+I saw the movie, I knew the story, but nothing could have prepared me for this account of it all.  The different parts of the whole scandal, all the involved people from Rothstein to Gandil, this book is full of detail.  I could not put it down as I wanted to keep learning more and more about what happened and why these players corrupted the game.  I started to sympathize for them even though what they did was wrong.  They were being cheated by Comiskey and there was no way around that. Well you can read it to find out how and learn more about the scandal as it unfolds+books
OK for starters.+P+A good beginner's book for those interested in building their own speakers without getting into heavy mathematics, passive electronics, complex woodworking, or folded horns. The book explains some the rudiments of  speaker theory, and barely enough to design your own simple crossover  network.  The book has several economical projects which the author already  debugged and are ready to build, including: the make and model of the  speakers, list of passive components, schematic - which usually include  extras like a Zobel network, and the cabinet dimensions.  Their are several  two-way projects and one three-way with a ten-inch woofer.  Most designs  use a soft-dome tweeter, if that's what you like.  There is a list of raw  component vendors in the back of the book. The designs for the ported boxes  use the Thiel method, and I am finding that this may be conservatively  sized toward the large side with respect to a flat bass response.  The  prose is a bit wordy, but still easy to read.  Overall, I have learned a  few things from this book+books
Umm..did I read the same book as everyone else?+N+What on earth did everyone else read?!?....this book isn't even worth 0.1 of a star. It's terrible! I'm pretty sure 20c mass produced romance novels are better than this drivel. I'm not really a fan of historical fiction, but it was given to me as a present so I felt I had to read it. The 'plot' is terrible. None of the characters have any depth or any real storyline.   Our protagonist, if you can call him that; Nicolas, only has one trick up his sleeve to "plough" his girls...a tale about how a unicorn's horn makes everything pure. He then sets about trying to sleep with basically any girl over 12. There's a bit of talk here and there about tapestries...but  I think a primary school course in art history can give you more meaningful information than this book. The story is complete nonsense and VERY poorly expressed and to be honest with you, I cannot believe it ever got published, let alone sold and read.+books
Extraordinary insight into an extremely contested discourse+P+Margaret Abraham has poured an enormous effort into sorting out the various dynamics, both above the surface and well below, of the discourse centering on the plight of South Asian women coming to the United States.  It is to her credit that her research has such size and substance yet provides compelling reading, with implications for many other areas of scholarship, including feminist theory.  Her narrative, rich as it is in detail from the interviews she conducted, has to do with discerning ways that scholars document brutal secrets existing in an extremely contested discourse, not that of assigning some kind of victimhood.  This is an important work on a difficult topic.  A must read+books
read it as a child - horrible morals+N+I got this book from my grandma when I was 6. I'm 20 now and realize what an awful story this is! This little rabbit gets a special gift of red cardinal's wings, which seemed awesome to me as a kid,  and his own mother and family reject him because he's wierd! A great book for homophobic parents or anyone else who wants their kid to know that being different is bad and if you are different, even your own parents will turn you away. I'm just glad I read more Shel Silverstein poems than I did trash like this+books
Insightful approach to combining astrology &amp; psychology+P+Stephen writes for the growth oriented astrologer. Not a book for beginners, yet one you will use contiually as a reference as you develop your skills in understanding major aspects. Indepth analysis of important aspects between two or more charts for those interested in synastry. I've had this book on my shelf for twenty years &amp; still find it insightful+books
American readers/students look elsewhere+N+This text will be a chore to read for most American students who are new to GIS.  Although the author(s) manage to cram alot of information into the relatively short chapters, the sentences are long and difficult to understand because of the overly wordy, jargon-filled 'proper' use of British English &amp; spellings.  If you decide to purchase this book, then I highly recommend the 'Oxford Unabridged English Dictionary' to go along with it.  The majority of the students in my class &quot;Geographic Information Systems I&quot; at Southwest Texas State University, which has one of the best geography programs in the nation, felt the same way I do, and also thought that the book was too advanced for an introductory GIS class.  I think that the professors at Southwest Texas State University are now using a different text for that class.  Also, people always complain that books tend to be geared toward a single software program- Well, like it or not, in the United States, ESRI has a monopoly on geographic software so you are going to have to learn ArcView/Info one way or another+books
I was disappointed+N+I have some of Ehlert's other books and have found them to be wonderful, however, I found that this book was so very negative and had some very terrible concepts in it.  Although the author portrayed activities that cats do, I was shocked to see them so boldly described in a children's book.  I teach preschoolers and would not want to read this book to my class+books
A Painful Read+N+Getting ready to go on international assignment, I picked up a copy of this book. The author's breathless inanities ran along the lines of (a paraphrase), &quot;wow, some British men used to wear bowler hats.&quot; I found very little useful in this book to prepare me for the transition, and was occasionally offended by his borderlne racist generalizations. I was expecting sociology and got sleaze instead+books
Do not encourage your child to side blindly with unions+N+Words cannot describe how ignorant this topic is. I could not believe it when I saw it in the bookstore. Why would parents want to encourage their children to side with unions? Educate your children, and they will not need a union to protect their job. Do not glorify this way of life if you want your child to succeed+books
Compulsory reading for every politician.+P+A sad commentary on our society that only the audio versions of this book are available. With the increase of interest in the First World War recently it is to this book that many people should turn for a gripping, factual account of life before, during and after the Great War. Mr Graves documents the pastoral quiet of England in the early part of the twentieth century and abruptly descends to recounting, in cold detail, the dreadful slaughter of the trenches. Through some of the most famous battles in history he survives, physically more or less intact but from the dry words; modest, English, reserved, we glimpse the true weight of the burden that such memories impose on their carriers and understand better the terrible toll that the War levied on all the nations of Europe+books
An Exciting and Thrilling Read+P+I give this outing of the Amelia Peabody Emerson novels five stars simply because it was a heck of a good story, a thrilling ride, and the ending came out of blue. As with the last few books in this series the violence directed at the Emerson family becomes more dangerous than it ever has been. People are being shot, prostitutes are murdered, and members of the Emerson clan are put in extreme, dangerous positions. What the author seems to be doing is showing what a family living in and working in Egypt might have to deal withat this point in history: Egyptian nationalistic movements, British prejudices, and the rumblings of WWI (minus the mystery high-jixs and Master Criminals, of course). The one annoying factor in this novel was Nefret. The author has chosen to take a once strong and intelligent young woman and turn her into a petty, childish, lovelorn twit who not only makes bad choices that put the family in greater danger, but also breaks the heart of nearly every member of the family. Ramses also had his annoying moments.  He has always been a favorite character, but since attaining adulthood he's become a brooding, self-righteous, and insulting young man with a real "superman" syndrome. Again, I'm allowing myself to become too invested in the lives of fictional characters, but that's the hallmark of a great author. One of the bright spots and little used aspects of this novel is David and his new wife Lia. Much of this novel revolves around accusations against David and his late grandfather, Abdullah, so I wish he could have played a larger role, but he does become a major focal point of the novel near the end. I just wish the author would allow this character to step into the limelight more instead of being little more than Ramses' shadow. Overall, this was an exciting and thrilling edition of the Emerson clan adventures and I strongly recommend the novel+books
Why is greatness so hard to maintain?  Find out here..+P+This story of a football team illustrates a much more profound element of human psychology - how to handle success.  Whether success is a relationship, career, business, or any other endeavor, the lessons here are to be heeded or the result will invariably be the same.  To put this in context, the 1985 Chicago Bears football team is arguably the best ever assembled in the modern era.  While other teams may have had more success over time, or had 1 less loss, this team is widely regarded as the most dominating.  In addition to the on-the-field success, the team created media stars like Mike Ditka, Jim McMahan and "The Fridge", along with established all time greats like Walter Payton, Mike Singletary and Dan Hampton.  So what happened? How did it blow up so fast?  A classic tale of forgetting to continue what made you successful in the first place.    The players and the team became successful by playing harder, and using an almost desperate intensity to how they played the game from a play design perspective to personal and individual motivation.  At first this focus (the 46 defense, the frenetic play style) took the league by surprise and gave them a decided advantage, but like most of us with any kind of success, once it was achieved they forgot to keep changing to adapt to the world they created.  In addition, they succumbed to the temptation of starting to believe their own press, and became infatuated with their own greatness.  Once that happens, it slips away quickly.  The detail behind the strategy success and infighting that eroded the spirit of the team, are depicted clearly.  After reading this book, which is full of delicious insights and salacious comments amongst the team about each other, it is hard to find where to place the blame.  Everyone seemed so wrapped up in the media circus that they all seemed to drift away from the mission.  For the football fan, this is a great book, full of strategic detail and player reactions.  For the person who wants to better understand the dynamics of how to keep themselves or their organization from getting too full of themselves and their success, the lessons here are easy to see, though often difficult to avoid.  The book is written exceptionally well, in that it flows easily, is always interesting, follows a nice chronological progressions, and does what it intends - describe the amazing success and quick burn out of perhaps the greatest football team ever assembled.+books
have problems with fellow coworkers?+P+This book explains why Rob in accounting can be such a jerk at times.  In other words, it assesses and explains personality disorders in the context of the workplace.  I highly recommend it for people with problems at work, or anyone interested in personality disorders+books
This is the only book you will need+P+This is an excellent book for anyone thinking about starting framing as a business or a hobby.  Mr. Logan explains nearly every aspect of the craft+books
A Useful Reference Book+P+This very complete volume is a lovely gift book as well as a useful reference book.  The only weakness is the lack of emphasis on arm positions when doing the steps although they are illustrated in the photographs.  I believe dancers who have experienced the following will find it useful too:  When I was a student of ballet, I was frustrated by the subtle differences in the standards of different teachers.  Sometimes I wondered, &quot;So how EXACTLY am I supposed to do this?&quot;  I did not enjoy being corrected for what a prior instructor had taught me and pronounced well-executed.  This book would have clarified things for me at the time.  Now that I practice alone, I find this book invaluable.    Also, I support Christine's review dated May 4, 2001+books
Very enjoyable with an important message+P+This will appeal to many people, from history buffs to health professionals and those of us who also love a good story. Myself, I always enjoy the human behavior aspect to how things came to be in our society, and the story of vaccination is terrific. Aside from the fun aspect of this book, Mr. Allen manages to write compassionately about the real people who have believed that their children's autism was caused by vaccines. There has been so much propaganda and spurious argumentation around this issue (particularly by people like Don Imus--he should be ashamed of himself), which has unfortunately lead many parents of children with autism to believe that vaccination caused their child's disability. I hope very much that Mr. Allen's work will help shine the light of reason on that sad situation+books
Not the best PJ+N+I've read and often re-read most every PJ book and column ever written. I've always liked this guy. I keep his books after I've read them instead of taking them to the local used book store.  "On the Wealth of Nations" did not work. Honestly, it sort of skidded into a ditch and got stuck from page one. It reads like the meeting minutes of a local book club. It's not so much PJ, it's the concept of taking possibly one of the country's biggest early day doorstops of a read and then having a top-end writer in the 21st century translate it with some political satire and humor for spin and flavor.. It just doesn't land. What may compound it all is that PJ's writing doesn't have quite the sharp edges on it as it used to. Age brings that on in all of us. PJ hasnt quite hit the grumpy ol' man part of his career yet. To take a book like the Wealth of Nations and do a think-tank review on it is asking a lot of any author with any style or talent. PJ gave it a go but honestly, I yawned a lot+books
Flat, but fast+N+This book was something that I read in one day, just to pass the time.  I really didn't care about the characters, and Lara seemed just too unreal to be true.  She was too much of Scarlet O'Hara in her dealings with a real estate world dominated by men.  I only finished it to find out what crisis happened that gave her an empty birthday party, but when I finally came to the end, it wasn't too satisfying+books
Kitty Needs Boot Camp+N+What's the deal with glorifying gangster behavior?  This cat is a poor role model for youngsters with his swagger and gangster affectations.  The author needs to straighten out this feline+books
The best book I've ever read!+P+Before I read this book, I was a fanatic of the movie Bambi. I still am, but it's very different from the book and it seems like 15 minutes after you read the book. I could see EVERYTHING that was described in the text of the book. It really has an effect on emotions. Some things are lighthearted, some things are truly heart breaking, there's even a few laughs. Everything is described in much detail. I felt like, at one point, that I was Bambi running for the first time in the meadow, drinking in the warm air. I could hear the dogs barking, the hoofbeats, and the gunshots. I HIGHLY recommend it to nature lovers and fans of the film. Now I just need to read Bambi's Children+books
Why Otters Don't Make Good Pets+N+The reason I don't recommend this book, despite the nice writing and decriptions of the Western Highlands, is for one dark fact: a number of wild otters died for Maxwell's selfish pursuit of having a wild animal as a pet. This is not the story of a man who raises abandoned wild otters cubs in the Western Highlands and releases them but the story of a man who takes otters from the wild in Iraq and Africa and tries to raise them in Scotland. What this story also tells us is that, if you are of a privillaged class, you can have any wild animal you want as your pet. Today this is illegal "pet" trading  and it is responsible for pushing certain species to the edge of extinction. I know that at the time this practice was not looked down upon as it is today and certain other nature writers (Durrell, Heinrich) engage in the same practice but with a more educated populus it should be clear: wild animals are not pets and they should stay wild+books
THe author should learn how to program first!+N+C'mon - at least get a CD with examples that actually compile!  If he were a programmer working for me, he'd get fired.  Save your money, and you can buy mine as used for 1/2 price.+books
Fun way to learn about maps+P+This book is classic Dr. Seuss...fun, silly, and children don't realize they're learning something.  Great book for teaching about maps.  I bought this for my 6 year old prior to going on vacation. We had been looking at maps and talking about what states we'd be driving through on our trip.  He enjoyed listening to the book and because of the way the information is presented (fun and silly rhymes), he has retained what he learned.  He has even referred back to specific bits of information we read from the book (i.e. Never Eat Shredded Wheat to remember North, East, South and West.)   The back of the book contains a glossary of terms mentioned in the book.  Highly recommended as an additional tool for teaching about maps+books
Excellent guide to Greek rhetorical terms+P+&quot;Figures of Speech&quot; sets itself apart from other guides to  rhetorical devices by its use of quotations to illustrate the terms it  defines. Citing the Bible, Shakespeare, and many other authors, Quinn shows  the power, purpose and effect of each device+books

go out on a good note+P+I've just reread "The Cat Who Smelled a Rat." In it, Jim Qwilleran is still in fine mettle. This mystery, No. 23 in the "Cat Who" series, is the last one most fans will enjoy. In this book, Qwill still remembers small details from previous novels. He's still interested in the mysteries around him, and he does some active snooping around. He's still a bit of the Lothario despite himself. And he still has faith in Koko's awesome powers.  Starting with the next book, the mystery gets solved almost by accident. Qwill becomes a parody of himself, and the novels start to get worse and worse. Eventually, the books begin to get facts wrong and characters begin to act, well, out of character or just inexplicably drop out of sight. (The latter must be hard to do in a small town 400 miles north of anywhere.) Whether Lilian Jackson Braun, now approaching 90, has lost her touch, or whether they're being ghost-written, I leave to you to judge. But the books become just dreadful.  I recommend that readers go out on a high note and stop after No. 23. It's been a good run+books
not completely my bowl of rice+P+... and yet i finished it in one sitting! I will warmly recommend this book to my "foreigner"-friends who are willing to gain a better understanding of the Filipino ways as well as to second-generation Filipino kids who might just find this book helpful for understanding and perhaps appreciating their parents' quirks. though I will need to caution them about some of the cultural/linguistic info here and there that isn't quite accurate.  unfortunately - even though one might argue that the very existence of this book disproves my impression - i'm mildly disappointed of how the protagonist, throughout the story, appears so eager to "renounce the country of her birth". I feel that the book would not have been any less, had the epilogue been left out. besides, was there really a need for those David Letterman's Top 10s o quasi? the Filipino society is avowingly matriarchal, mind you. so, to all of you "Westerners" out there, better scratch that "equality"-part+books
Benford's work is not a sequel; it's a rebuttal.+N+I'm reminded of the story of a well-known SF writer who as an experiment tried revising E.E. &quot;Doc&quot; Smith's galactic epics to remove the obsolete and clunky bits only to find he'd removed all the fun along with  them.  It's only by virtue of not tampering with the original text that  Benford avoids commiting the same fault but with premeditation.  Of course  &quot;Against The Fall Of Night&quot; is obsolete SF.  That doesn't matter.   What matters is its atmosphere, and it is this atmosphere that Benford  rejects systematically and irreverently.  Clarke might not have objected to  the changes, but authors view their works very differently than the readers  do+books
Look elsewhere+N+This book promised the world, the author and his friends sounded reputable and knowledgable; it was only the cover art that looked dodgy.  We have often been told to not judge books by their covers, but in this instance, the cover illustration gives a good indication of the content: cheap and childish. The font is large and type set far apart, which makes the small amount of content fill the many pages. There are dozens of spelling and grammatical errors in the book, and a remarkable amount of irrelevant stories. (Matt, do you think your readers care that you just bought a new Mercedes? We do not. There is nothing in this story for ME, unless you are going to teach me how to do the same thing. The story needs to have a point and some BENEFIT to the listener or reader!) Much of the book's "million dollar tips" can be found faster and for free on the internet, just by doing a Google search on "marketing techniques". Indeed, much of the book (when it is not self-congratulation) refers to websites where one can find more information. I gather that at least some of the websites may be owned by, or affiliated with, Matt and his team. If this is a sales brochure for another online course, it does not advertise well or read well. Look elsewhere for lessons on how to market and sell effectively+books
Worthwhile elementary text.+P+This book covers a lot of ground, so if it starts with some awfully basic stuff, that's okay. The only real complaint that I have is that the authors are a bit too rah-rah for my taste when discussing marketing, but then, that's probably par for the course; everybody who is into marketing tends to go overboard on the bubbly, fake energy. That, and the fact that they demonstrate an astounding lack of understanding of basic arithmetic when they assert that "while saving 2% by paying a bill early may not sound like much, doing it over the course of a year will save you 24%".+books
NOT ON OF BRAUNS BEST+N+I've read some of the Braun series cat books and this one wasn't one of my favorites. It was boring with no plot and it did mention very little about the Butterfly Girl or who she is. The story didn't make any sense at all. I couldn't get into this one. I read it but was disappointed in it. I'm lucky that I only paid $1 for it towards charity+books
This is a great book covering the seam method.+P+I would highly recommend this book to anyone seeking better fit in dressmaking.  The seam method of pattern alteration is pretty easy and straightforward.  Judith presents alterations for the bodice, skirt, and pants.  With the information in this book, you can alter your pattern for square or sloping shoulders, wide or narrow hips/waist, thin arms, rounded back, and many other necessary alterations.  I did not find the bust alteration to be very helpful to me, however.  I prefer other methods, but I often use the seam method for widening my waist and hips in my own patterns.  Additionally, Judith offers style suggestions to flatter various figures.  It is an interesting and useful book+books
Dostoyevsky at his very worst+N+Don't waste your time reading this book - this book is awful! This book was supposed to be so good, according to the other reviews, and it's definitely not a good novel. In fact, this is by far the worst novel I have read in my life. I think one of the other reviewers hit the nail on the head - most of this book just seems like random writing and ultimately it has no real purpose for carrying forward the plot line. Indeed, it definitely seems like he was just trying to meet a word count for the publisher. The edition of the book I read was slightly over 700 pages, and it could have easily been reduced to 300 without affecting in any way the plot line. Thus the reader is left to swallow 400 pages of pointless writing that just seems like "waffling" to mention the term used in England to describe writing that leads you no where. Not only that, but the 300 pages devoted to actually explaining the plot are not that interesting anyway. The plot line of the novel is incredibly implausible; a prince who is an "idiot" but on occasions doesn't seem like such an idiot after all and who suffers from a mysterious illness of "idiocy" that could not be labelled as an actual illness by modern medicine. Moreover, one of the principal characters in the novel, Aglaia Yepanchin supposedly is madly in love with the prince while at the same time making fun of him in a very rude way right in front of his nose - am I the only one here who thinks this is JUST a little implausible? And then just to make matters worse, and as an appetizer after having to swallow 650 pages of horrible writing, near the end of the novel Dostoyevski puts in the mouth of the prince two full pages of the most outrageous slander against the Catholic religion I have read in my life. Supposedly, according to Dosteyvski, atheism comes from the Catholic religion - certainly Dosteyevski doesn't hide his hatred for the Catholic faith. Even atheists would laugh at such an absurd proposition+books
An excellent and understandable introduction to chemistry+P+While most of the one year chemistry texts cover more or less the same principles, the order varies, the illustrations are similar, but they vary most in the way they explain the material.  It is in the vocabulary they use and develop that helps the student develop the intuitions, understanding, and skills the authors are after.  This is a very well written text that is useful for non-chemistry majors as well as science students needing an introductory course in chemistry.  I am reading and working through this text with my 13 year old son.  Yes, he is bright and interested in science, but the text is clear enough for both of us to be able to grasp and understand the principles each section of each chapter is presenting to us.  Not only does this text focus on teaching the basic principles of chemistry, it also includes historical notes in the margins, and the text focuses on the practical uses of chemistry to illustrate its principles through practical applications.  While other texts also have these features, I believe this text to be quite accessible to even those without a strong previous grounding in science.  Each chapter begins with a series of bullet points introducing what is going to be discussed along with a short essay.  I like the marginal notes and illustrations as well as the "Give it some thought" feature that asks the student a question or two in order to clarify understanding and ensure a grasp of the principles introduced in that section.  Like most modern textbooks, there is also a liberal use of color to aid in presentation and guide the eye.  The authors also provide occasional "Strategies In Chemistry" boxes that encourage the student to develop a certain kind of thought process and ways in looking at the principles of chemistry.    At the end of each chapter is a section called Summary and Key Terms that hits the highlights of each section in a paragraph or two with the key terms in boldface.  Then there is a section called Visualizing Concepts that have basic problems with illustrations in order to get the student to work mentally on the material learned.  The section of problems has a series of questions for each section with the red numbered questions having the answers in the back of the book.    There are also a series of handy tables provided as appendices and standard charts on the inside of the front and back covers including the periodic table.  Again, many of these features are included in other texts because there has been quite a bit of convergence on what is to be taught in a one year introduction to chemistry course.  The differences are in the way things are said more than what is covered.  I think this is an excellent and very useful text for learning the basics of chemistry and why it matters in our world+books
This book is wonderful!+P+I purchased this book for a friend's birthday and after looking through it, nearly kept it+books
GRE Book Review+P+This book was somewhat helpful. I used it during a course offered at my college campus. However, I would say that it is just as beneficial to use the Powerprep CD they send you in the mail.+books
good beginner guide, but not much more+N+This is actually an excellent introduction to short term trading. Everything is well explained and pleasantly written. Day Trading 101. However, it's not really marketed as that, so it gets 2 stars.  If you read this book and much of it is a revelation, you need to spend the next 4-6 months doing research, reading, and paper trading. If you were to start trading based on what's in this book you would lose your shirt.  It's akin to a book on football that explaines the field, how far apart the lines are, where the end zone is, who the players are, what the positions do, what a pass is, the three things that can happen when you pass, etc. It would even have a few basic plays, the "long pass", "student body right", etc. Everything you need to know about football, except how to actually play and win.  Basic, well explained information is what this book has. And if you're just getting into trading it's a worthwhile read. It'll give you a foundation that will help you understand more advanced books like Secrets Of An Underground Trader or Technical Analysis of the Financial Market (Murphy).  But even the lack of advanced technical stuff is not really a strike against Toni's book. The technical books really are just research books for helping you design your own system. They are practically outdated as soon as they come out and even if they're not, it's a dangerous thing to rely on someone else's system. You need to design a system that you can trade and you're comfortable trading. If you can't do this, NO book can help you.  Which leads to the main reason I gave the book 2 stars. Lack of any real discussion of trading psychology. The book you NEED to buy if you're going to trade is Reminiscences Of A Stock Operator. It's 80 years old and explains the mentality of trading as well as any book out there. The Psychology of Risk is another good book. Understanding what it takes to trade and determining if you have that is critical. As is understanding if you can make split second decisions when it's $40K of your own money on the line.  Toni devotes a few pages to it, including a silly 'Psychology quiz' which is probably the same quiz they use in the back of Cosmo to determine whether you're an agressive lover or a passive one.  She also devotes a page at the end of each chapter to 'self-help' tips. It's true that you can't design a system for yourself if you don't know yourself, so these are helpful. At the end of the day tho, they won't explain what it takes mentally to be a trader. Personally, I find Yoga to be a good way to clear my head in the morning and get focused. But it's a means to end. Not the end itself. Such are the self-help tips in the book. If you don't know what you're trying to achieve, they are only so useful.  So if you've read several books on trading you can skip this. There are much more advanced books out there.  If you're new to trading and are looking for a well written book explaining the basics and a bit more, this is worth the money. But it's not a classic or something you'll find yourself referring to as the years go by+books
dissapointment+N+The Summoning and The Seige were both enjoyable, but despite a decent first half, the last 200 or so pages of the sorcerer were more or less unreadable.  Shame, because this was otherwise a pretty good series+books
Fine Piece of Literature+P+Grand Hotel, the translation of Menchen im Hotel, is about a group of strangers staying at a posh hotel in Berlin. Each of them have their troubles and become connected throughout the novel.   Baron von Geigern is a down-and-out man who steals to maintain his lavish lifestyle. He falls in love with the aging dancer Grusinskaya one night when attempting to steal from her. She immediately latches onto him because he is young and she feels rejuvenated by his affection. The best scene in the book is that between the Baron and Grusinskaya the morning after; it is filled with psychology and understanding of the two characters. Kringelein is a pathetic man who comes to the hotel to spend his life savings on the last few days of his life, hoping to finally find happiness. He meets the Baron who takes him under his wing to show him a good time. Flammchen is a stenographer employed by Preysing at the hotel who falls in love with the Baron. Preysing plots to cheat on his wife with Flammchen who he becomes obsessed with, but is more concerned with the possibility that his company could completely deconstruct. Dr. Otternschlag is a sad man who always checks for mail at the front desk but never has any. He observes the hotel and acts as sort of a narrator at times to the story. Each character is made realistic by the author, and the plot twist at the end serves as an appropriate and exciting climax.   I read the book because I loved the film starring John Barrymore as the Baron, Greta Garbo as Grusinskaya, Lionel Barrymore as Kringelein, Joan Crawford as Flammchen, Wallace Berry as Preysing, and Lewis Stone as Otternschlag. It is a wonderful adaptation and a beautifully photographed film. However, there are some differences, as there always are when books are made into films. The Baron is slightly more likable in the book than in the film because more attention is paid to him. One needs to read the book to understand Grusinskaya's motivations; since a young star played her in a very exaggerated way, the character seems more insane than justified in her actions. Kringelein is somewhat less respectable in the book but just as likable. Flammchen looks differently in the film, but is better developed and more realistic in it as well. Preysing is just as dull in both. Dr. Otternschlag is paid much more attention in the book than in the film. Overall, the book is more philosophical about the characters and their relationships to each other because it does not rely solely on dialogue like the film+books
A Strong West Wind: A Mighty Memoir+P+If you want the opposite of James Frey--that is, if you want to read beautiful, true prose that doesn't flinch from the deeper truths, read Caldwell. This is a book about West Texas, growing up, leaving home, struggling with family, remembering the farm, hating Vietnam, going to Mexico, reading great books, moving forward. I put a pot of coffee on and read through the night, then passed it on to my Dad, who did the same. Thanks, Ms. Caldwell.+books
1 good thought much over-discussed+N+While I thought that Ms. Warner's points were accurate, she spends the entire book going over and over the same points until one is simply tired of hearing about the problem with no idea how to escape it. I agree that many of today's famalies are over-scheduled and spending way too much time at daily multiple activities rather than living. This book points out a problem but does nothing to suggest how to combat it.   One quote from the book I found offensive was on pg. 25, "I had no qualms about eliminating those activities I found needlessly boring or stupid-like the lap-sit story hour at the nearby American Library..." As a children's librarian I guess I took this harder than others would. I agree that many activities could and should be scaled back and or cut, but perhaps Ms. Warner fails to understand that story hour is an effort to teach parents how to share books at home with kids. Of all the things to cut it is my hope people will opt out of soccer for a 3 year old and take a trip to the library once in a while.+books
Hospital Sketches+N+The main character of Hospital Sketches is Nurse Tribulation Periwinkle. The book is about her experiences as a nurse at a Washington D.C. hospital during the civil war. The theme is cheerful despite the wounded men. One man showed his gratitude for the way she helped him stay cheerful by offering "I've got a pair of earbobs and a handkerchief pin I'm a-goin' to give you"(Alcott 69). Cheerfulness is shown when a nurse says, "Bless their hearts..."(Alcott 75) because she is so proud of the soldiers. The Author makes everything more confusing than it has to be. For instance, "as we quitted them, followed by grateful glances that lighted us to bed"(Alcott 75). She uses this sentence to say that people smiled at the nurses as they went to bed. She often switches from one subject to another without making any indication of it, leaving you confused. "At the beginning of my reign, dumps and dismals prevailed"(Alcott 77). She says this while she is telling you about the breakfast she is eating. That has nothing to do with breakfast. She is unclear about what she is referring to. The main Conflict doesn't come until the end. She gets sick and needs to decide whether to keep on working there, or go home and try to get better. She decides to go home because her father says, "Come home." I think this book was poorly written, and I don't recommend it to anyone+books
A gem+P+I found &quot;Leadership presence&quot; to be very inspiring not only for leaders and managers but for every human being engaged in the business of life!  As a teacher, mother and grand-mother, I am using some of the skills offered in the book with my students and family and finding them more than useful: profound.  This book is not just another &quot;how to&quot; book, it comes from deeper waters of presence and compassion.  Plus it is fun to read, full of great stories.  A gem+books
Smart about the First Ladies+P+I bought this book for my 1st-grade daughter and she loves it!  Each time we read this book, she selects a new favorite first lady.  It is not the best history book ever written, but it has sparked a young childs interest in history and learning about our country. +books
This Book is Obsolete (0 star rating)+N+The book's case studies, code and build files assume that J2EE 1.4 comes with the PointBase database server.  J2EE 1.4 currently only comes bundled with the Derby database server.  As a result, the book is useless.  Emails to the publisher failed to resolve the problem+books
Learn the technical side of drawing+P+You have to put in some time but this book gives you all the tools you need to draw well. I can already see my progress after a few hours. Highly recommend this book+books
Lots of Info and Great  Format+P+This book was the best!!!!!  I have a book club and That was my first recommendation.   IT is one of the best books that I have seen about the Titanic.  It has a clear and easy-to-read format.  Plus, it has facts tahr are undescribable.  They are tons of interesting facts that you can read again and again.  It is a truly wonderful collection and I reccomend all to read it.  Such as did you know there were actually two Grand Staircases???  And Violet Jessop, former sewardess on the Titanic was also on Titanic's sister ships (Britannic and Olympic) when they sank?  This is a book full of fun and facts.  You will enjoy it for sur+books
know more be more+P+The Other Side of War offers the most human look at the day to day impact of war on women worldwide. It is a story of tragedy and loss and more importantly a story of courage and resiliency. In text and astonishingly beautiful photographs, we see strong women who refuse defeat and claim victory in small and great ways each and every day.+books
Continues where Diplomacy of Wolves left off.  Wonderful.+P+This is the second in the Secret Texts trilogy and takes off where Diplomacy of Wolves ends.  Focusing on the rebirth of a prophet and the plan of the long dead Dragons, a group of destructive magicians, to again  rule the world, the twists are many and the action great.  The Sabirs  figure greatly in both sides of the battle, and Kait learns more about her  Karnee abilities.  Again the magical system is wonderfully complex and the  consequences make magic anything but mundane.  I could not put this book  down, and can't wait for the next installment of the trilogy.  Lisle has  increased her skills as a writer over the years, adding to her natural  talent as a story teller.  Great characters, original settings, a winner+books
finger lickin' good+P+This book has absolutely fantastic recipes - all the favorites and then some!  My husband and I make a lot of these "clones" regularly.  Particular hits are the KFC Honey BBQ wings and the Baskin Robbins Ice Cream Cake.  Great for get-togethers or when you're having a craving at home+books
QUENTIN-SENTIAL SCREENPLAYS+P+Ah yes...Tarantino's first script entitled True Romance which he sold for 30,000 dollars is a genius effort of great proportion and the writing, you will notice in subsequent films and scripts,is common for him. Certain  terms will show up later on in other movies. And as for Reservoir Dogs,his  second greatest film ever,he used the money from True Romance's script to  make this ingenius mob classic complete with terms used in his other films  including one or two from True Romance+books
Minus+N+This is trash. Badly written, melodramatic, utterly silly. My copy is already in the recycle (not: re-use) bin.+books
Your 2nd Pregnancy - What to Expect This Time+P+I've found this book to be very informative as well as entertaining. Katie Tamony's approach to becoming a second-time mom is extremely reassuring and confidence inspiring+books
Binding concerns+P+I hesitated ordering this book because a previous reviewer reported that he had found the binding to be inferior. Perhaps this was true in previous bindings, but the copy I recently obtained looks fine in this regard and should stand up to heavy use for some years to come.  I'm finding this an excellent disctionary in all regards, though as a beginner I have not put it to lots of use. Basically I use the New Nelson, with this dictionary as a supplement, especially for compounds. And there are times when this alternate system of radical identification is just easier than the traditional system.+books
An excellent book for Indians born in USA+P+I saw this book for the very first time, while browsing through a book store in London Heathrow airport.   Honestly, what caught my eyes is the name of the book.   Unlike all other books  I read about Hinduism, this book is very simple.  I read the whole book during my flight from London to New York.  This book answered all my questions I had about my culture my culture as well as my  religion.   I also learned so aspects of  Christianity also from this book. The book  also helped me to answer all type of questions my Christian friends ask me.   Now when they ask me, "Why Hindus worship many gods?" I can answer them, "Hindus worship  the one and only God - Brahman which express itself in many forms."  When they ask me, "Why Hindus worship idols?" I can answer them, "Like every one else, including Christians, Hindus use idols or icons to concentrate on God who has no name or form."  I can also tell them that Hindus believe  that every person   who search  after  truth will attain  salvation [ self-realization]  irrespective of whether he or she is a Hindu or Christian or Moslem.    Am I A Hindu? is indeed a book for  Indians born in the west who are desperately trying to learn about their faith.  In short, AM I A HINDU? Is  a great   book for anyone who wants to know everything about Hinduism.    An amazing  book  without any dogma or demagoguery.+books
I got to page two...+N+I made it to page two of the text (page seven of the book) and got disgusted with her style.    From this page alone: ka-boom. And this man Skinner. maniacal psychologist. baby in a box so as to raise her. whatever humanity he touched turned to bone. [?].  This I know to be true.  This much we presume we know. Genuine court of law.  Boom-boom went the gun.  Note there is not one quotation mark here.  THIS IS HER WRITING and the editor's editing.  I don't know if I can go on!  I'm very sorry I bought this book. +books
Some of the answers are wrong+N+And simple math answers too. For example, (1/2)(2/3) = ? They say it's 1/6. I'm of the opinion that it's actually 1/3. That's just one of several I've ran across.  Still, it's better than nothing, but I think looking at your old college textbooks and doing the ETS questions is probably a better route+books
I won't read another book by this author+N+I received this book for Christmas and was annoyed by the writing style within the first 50 pages.  The story itself isn't bad, but I found the writing styles simplistic and like I said before, annoying.  The four main characters have no chemistry.  They are supposed to be the best of friends but you never feel any emotion out of any of them.  The same phrases are also uttered over and over and over again.  Here these people are, on the brink of something magical and amzing that they have found that will turn the world on the edge and all you hear constantly uttered out of one of the character's mouth is, "I sure wish I knew."    Hey look, I can't believe it, how did those people build gateways to other worlds?  Boy, I sure wish I knew.  Hey!  Look at that amazing and terrifying flying insect, how does it fly with such small wings?  I sure wish I knew.  Maybe I expected too much of this book since I don't read sci-fi only.   But as I said, I could hardly finish this book much less read anything else written in this style.  What a shame =+books
I would look elsewhere+N+This book was a new choice from our professor who was teaching our mechanism design class. In my opinion, the three authors who wrote it each took a section and slapped their parts together. Totally different writing style as you go throught the book. In addition t is a small book and you constanlty are turning pages to makes references to figures which makes it hard to read with good flw. n addition a lot of the diagrams are unclear and dont necessarily say what they represent. Our professor ended up hating the book himself. A good reference maybe but not for the beginner+books
I can't believe someone would read this!!+N+I found this book extremely boring and very hard to read.  The conversations don't flow and the interaction between characters seems abrupt.  In fact, I didn't even finish the book that is how borning it was.  Now, I don't normally review every book I read unless I have very strong feelings and this produced a very strong sense of a waste of time!!!  Do yourself a favor and get another book.  Maybe something by Diane Mott Davidson+books
scrumptious!+P+A complete Wodehouse fanatic, I would have trouble giving less that five stars to anything I have read so far. Uncle Fred  is a particularly good one to add to the guest room bookshelf----incredibly funny and nice light reading for a few days away from home+books
don't look thru human eyes+P+i wanted to throw out a comment to the lengthy review blasting Elena and Clay's relationship. I loved this book, not only because Kelley Armstrong doesn't waste time with characters that run around wringing their hands and whining about how 'cursed' they are. Too many authors in this genre waste time with this kind of nonsense. The whole "I'm not human therefore I'm damned" thing.   If you read Kelley's e-novella about Clay and Elena's first meeting, you see very clearly that Elena actually had a great deal in common with Clay BEFORE she was changed. I think that was what drew him to her. No, his actions later on weren't very noble, but I think when you understand that he doesn't think like a human, then you understand him better.   Also, this book does a good job of introducing the three way relationship between Clay-Elena-Jeremy. The fact that the main characters are not Alpha wolves, but Betas(the followers of the pack) really is a nice touch.  I love this story, it's one of my favorites. I like the fact that Kelley Armstrong went outside of the box to inject something a little different into her wolves. To many authors are lazy with their subjects. She's the real deal+books
Excellent for World-Themes in the Classroom!+P+I have taught a couple of summer schools with PreK and Kindergarten students and we had soooo much fun with many of these songs.  The absolute favorite is the first song "Hello to all the children of the world", which teaches children to say hello in different languages.  We did half sign language, half movement which made it not only fun for the kids, but also for the parents when we sang this song to them.  The other favorite songs: "Brown Girl in the Ring" and "Going Over the Sea".  If you are a teacher or even a parent, your kids will LOVE this CD and will learn a little culture in the process+books
There must be better books on franchising+N+Michael Seid's extensive experience yields some useful insights and he explains many of the steps involved in franchising, but the book reads too much like advertorial and Seid spends way too much time trumpeting his own accomplishments. (Wendy's founder Dave Thomas' contributions to the book are woefully slim and including him as a coauthor seems to serve more as a marketing tool.) Franchising for Dummies would be a worthwhile addition to your library on the subject, but if you're looking for a single, objective, authoritarian source on the subject, keep looking+books
Disappointing+N+Breaking the Chain was a truely disappointing book for me.  Although the sub-title is &quot;the true story&quot; it seemed that the text reflected more innuendo than it did &quot;truth&quot; concerning drug use in the cycling world.  In a time when the cycling world is trying to get back on it's feet after being rocked with gossip about drug use (particularly EPO), the book seems to add to, rather than take away from, the culture of rumor.  I finished the book with the feeling that the author wrote it not to inform the world of drug use in professional cycling, but rather as a means of making money (now that he was without employment).  I am sorry that I may have contributed to his retirement fund by purchasing the book+books
Well written hot topic.+P+I found this book well written and deals with key issues that are importnat in todays world such as immigration, nationalism, democrasy and terrorism.   The book is divided into 4 parts. Each of these parts include issues that examine nationalism, immigration, governments and racism. Also anti-immigrant sentiments, the "War on Terror," Muslim and Jewish Semitism as well as importnat issues of power.   I found a section particularly interesting dedicated to helping people understand where trouble and violence may erupt in volatile areas. Due to Rifaats personal experience with turbulence and war, he became alerted to several factors which lead him to predict where aggressive nationalism may occur. He formalized a model to help foresee where trouble and violence might erupt.   He states this modle proved useful over the years, as he prevented a multinational corporation from putting its head office in Beirut a few years before civil war broke out. He read the signes indication the possibility of violence on a large scale.   The four factors which Rifaat formulated to reliably indicate a probable outbreak of violence is the instinctive nature of group formation coupled with fanning the falmes of nationalism, the lack of human inhibition for killing and the power leaders possess.   The book offers an interesting, exciting and sometimes humorous view into world politics, racial profiling, terrorism and above all, lessons in human nature. If you want a witty insight into these issues get this book. +books
Unreadable+N+This is not meant to serve as a useful review but as a warning that the positive reviews here at amazon are not reflective of the actual quality of the book. This book, in my opinion, is unreadable and listlessly and discursively meanders. A complete waste of time that lacks depth and resonance. Take time researching this book before you buy it because it's the worst book I've ever purchased.+books
Must reading for a better sense of the man+P+I had been familiar with the Kenny book &quot;Wittgenstein&quot; and &quot;Wittgenstein's Vienna&quot; but after having read Monk's vol 1 on Russell knew this would be an excellent read. Oddly enough it left me with the question, &quot;Are geniuses born or made?&quot; Much of what Monk did for us with this book was give us a solid feel for the life of the person within which the philosophy could make sense. Why did Wittgenstein write the way he did? Answered. What issues drove him? Answered. I would say this book is must reading for a better sense of the man+books
An easy read+P+I recently bought this book and found it to be very easy to read, rather than just have lists of grammatical tables like some books I have seen. The author recommends helpful websites throughout the book and makes use of 200 short passages that can be read as you go. All grammar is covered in the beginning chapters, and the following ones are devoted to metre, poetic style, grammar of poetry, how to read old english manuscripts, spelling variants, phonetics, and then an anthology of texts. The glossary is full of translations of every word used in the texts. I think this book is excellent for the beginner who wants to gain a sound overview of the language+books
ommission? not really!+P+The Lexicon is the most comprehensive source of Rand writings and ideas.  However, it is not all inclusive: she has spoken about parenting,  child-rearing, and children. One example is a radio interview that she did  discussing romantic literature which led to a discussion on children and  parenting. Also, look at &quot;Objectivist Epistimology&quot; where she  discusses how a child develops cognitively (which would have connections  with raising a child)+books
A Useless Book+N+Save your money and leave this book on the shelf. This guide to summer programs is disorganized and unclear. Moreover, most of the information is duplicated in its heftier sibling, Peterson's &quot;Summer Opportunities for Kids and Teenagers&quot;+books
Ignores the obvious cultural contributions of the Scotch-Irish+N+Jeff Bigger's book is well written; however it offers little to our understanding of the unique ethnic contributions of the German and Scotch-Irish settlers who dominated the cultural landscape of Appalachia.  This is seen in his treatment of twentieth century women.  Loretta Lynn (a native of Eastern Kentucky) is briefly discussed on only one page while four pages were written about Billie Holiday (born in eastern Pennsylvania and raised in Baltimore) and Janis Joplin.  Dolly Parton (an East Tennessee, native) earned only one page of text and Rosa Parks (born in Tuskegee Alabama) received five pages.  Janis Joplin was born and raised in Port Arthur, Texas.  It seems Biggers is confused about the geographic boundaries of Appalachia.  He, like many non-Appalachian natives who regard themselves as enlightened scholars of culture, want to see Appalachia as anything but white and nearly homogeneous with regard to ethnicity.  Rediscovering the South's Celtic Heritage does a much better job of showing the region's culture as it developed over time+books
Why are you writing this book?  I don't know+N+While I was reading American Normal, I kept asking myself, why is he writing this book.  Someone finally asks the author the same question, and his answer is, &quot;I don't know.&quot;  I have a theory.  Osborne started out to write a book showing that AS is an imaginary problem coined to put labels on eccentrics.  When halfway through the book his research shows him that it's quite a lot more than that, in fact a real syndrome completely different from just &quot;a little eccentricity&quot;, he is lost.  He no longer knows why he is writing.  He keeps mentioning drugs.  There are no drugs in the treatment of AS itself.  He keeps metioning psychiatrists.  It's a neurological disorder, not a psychiatric disorder.  He meets, casually, a few Aspies, and suddenly he's an expert.  This book mostly made me angry, as it would anyone who knows someone with AS.  He seems often to think the whole this is a joke. After all, he's eccentric, and he doesn't have it... Worst book I've read on autism yet.  Pit+books
I give him credit for trying+N+May I first applaud Dr. Schneider in seeing the value of alternative treatments as opposed to traditional medicine.  However Dr. Schneider as with most Md's is not a good source of information on alternative forms of treatment.  Md's are lucky in their 1000+ hours of education to get one 1/2 of a class on nutrition and alternative therapies.  Therefore their knowledge base is close to nil.  Most of the stuff he lists is mainstream knowledge. His research is not complete and most of it requires you to talk to your MD first who in turn would very unlikely recommend anything natural. However, because Americans have a love affair with their Md's they spend 244 BILLION a year on drugs.  This in turn has made Dr. Schneider's profession one of the top five leading causes of death in the nation (JAMA). Because of this Md's who are seeing a shift away from traditional medical care can capitalize immensely on this shift in care by billing themselves as experts.  I'd recommend someone who has MANY years of experience in nutrition and alternative therapy.  Nutritionists, Naturopathic Physicians, Ayruvedic Physicians, Doctors of Chiropractic and Osteopathic Physicians are much better sources of info.  Think about it.+books
Boring, Boring, Boring+N+This was my first Bertrice Small book and I have to say I was not impressed.  I did not care for the character at all.  She was spoiled, and self rightous to everyone, including her family.  I also thought the book was extremely boring.  There was to much descrpition on small mundane things and not enough plot and action.  It took me forever to get through this book and I am a very fast reader.  This book made me not want to read any of her other books because I am afraid that they will be just as bad.  I hope this was a one time oops for Ms. Small because this book was not good at all+books
OH WOW+P+The &quot;Simply&quot; series was my first Carley books to read . I love her fast paced stories. They are the kind that grab you and dont let go till long after the end. I loved all three books, but I would have to say that this one is my favorie. It is very sensual and had me turning the pages so fast it took only about two hours for me to read the aweseome story. Ill be looking for any other titles by Carley and snatch them up as fast as possible. I cant wait for what she has in store for us next+books
Not nearly as good as other London travel books+N+I'm amazed at the positive reviews this book has received. If found it severely lacking for a number of reasons: First, it has very few maps, the ones it does have are terrible, and there is no coordination between descriptions of things and their location on the maps. Second, it lacks the kind of detail that you'll find in some other books. Finally, the section dealing with accommodations is almost completely useless. Overall, I was extremely disappointed with this book.  If you want really good London tavel guides, the Rough Gude to London and the Eyewitness London guide are far, far better+books
The Most Beautiful Story Ever+P+I have always loved Paul Gallico as a writer, and this short story is one of my favorites of his work. It is a beautiful story that children may like, but adults will love. The story is about a lonely artist, Philip Rhyader, who retreats from society due to a hunchback and deformed hand. He lives in a lighthouse where he creates his works of art and tends to injured animals.  One day a young girl named Frith brings him a snow goose that has been injured. (I loved the book so much that I named my oldest daughter Fritha.) Although she is at first scared of Rhyader, a friendship develops between them as they tend the goose. After the goose is healed, it flies away but returns every year to stay with Rhyader for the season. The girl, Frith, returns each year when the snow goose returns. Rhyader falls in love with her but she does not realize it.  The book ends with the battle of Dunkirk when the British troops are trapped on the beach. Rhyader, who was unable to fight in the war because of his deformities, takes his small sailboat and crosses the channel several times, delivering the British soldiers to safety. On each trip he is accompanied by the beautiful snow goose.  I'll give you fair warning, the ending of the book is one of the saddest you will ever read. However, the message of love and friendship and hope conveyed in the book will make you want to return and read it over and over again.+books
Inexorable, and thereby lies its dark persuasion+P+Living in a milieu far removed from his intoxicating days as a rising painter gaining increasing esteem for his flattering portraits, Henry MacAlpine has isolated himself in a form of penance...  Perhaps the penance is for the things he did, for his past selfishnessnes, his past surrender to the "Establishment", the easy painting that would please and sell swiftly rather than the more difficult portraitures that strip down, as he puts it, to the skull and even to the soul.  But my sense is that his penance is not really for these things.  It is for what he WILL do...  Iain Pears is a writer of distinction. More than that, although he writes literature that I believe will be enjoyed by readers of wit centuries from now, Pears is also a writer who can tell a rattling good story. His turn of phrase - delicious! I grew to know this Henry MacAlpine as he unburdens himself to his subject, so that MacAlpine was not just painting a portrait of the self-satisfied old friend, the "great" critic William Naysmith, but he is also painting a portrait of himself.  We see it all - his attitude to sexuality, religion, penance, art, men, women, crime, superficiality, everything. We see how he has altered and developed, and how he has remained what he is, for in the flowing change and in the constancy both... that is where the truth and validity of a human being lies. We change. We do not change. That is our lot. Perhaps in this sense, at the mercy of events, we are true to MacAlpine's vision of humanity - ludicrous in the face of the great forces such as a storm. But MacAlpine in all his imperfect self is also revealed by his monologue... and we know we do not take his view as a point of absolute truth (a lovely trick, that. Pears did the same thing in "Instance of the Fingerpost", leaving an unsettling notion that the last narrator was the "real" truth, but careful reading reveals that it is all just... points of view, self-deceptions, however true the narrator attempts to be). Perhaps, then, we are not so ludicrous, and perhaps we transcend the forces of nature.  Iain Pears's palette-rich writing shows such a balance of line and colour in the careful choice of words, phrases, flow of written thoughts. I can almost smell the texture - it is like "reading" a painting. The book glows with colour, the subtle highlights of the artist's brush.  Some reviewers have not taken to the monologue style used in this book - I found it extremely effective, and also such a delicious irony in that the critic, wordy and pompous as he clearly was, has absolutely no say here. He is drawn to MacAlpine's retreat in what seems at first his own choice, but right from the start, I sensed that this was not exactly the case.  Iain Pears leads the reader through an extraordinary thread of narrative that is remembrance through the eyes of one man. We learn of MacAlpine's fascination with the image of death, the futility of man in the grip of forces greater than he is, an image of decaying flesh washed up on the shore. We learn also (but suspect it early on) what MacAlpine considers the real crime that would impel a certain act of murder.  That the denouement is inevitable and foreseen by the reader does not diminish the fascination of this wonderfully dark novel. Pears could have written a different book, a book in which the reader is "fooled" ? la typical thriller plots. But this book is not a thriller. It is a portrait that creates knowledge, and paints ever more deeply to find motivations and reasons and shadings and colourings, not merely the bare facts. Consider this: we know within quite a few pages what is to come. But like Garc?a Marquez's extraordinary "Chronicle of a Death Foretold", it's not WHAT... it's why, how... Give us the details; it's the details we want.  I found this work very satisfying. I did not find the monologue style tedious at all, and as soon as I realised Pears WANTED us to suspect what was coming, I read not to find out the end, but to "read" the brush-strokes.  For those who will approach it in this way, I think that there is a gripping and fascinating reading experience waiting for you.  For those who want a twist in the tail with an unexpected ending, no... This miniature portrait of a book is probably not for you.  Read the book as a revelation of the skull and soul of two men, and perhaps you too will love this book as much as I did+books
Must read+P+Reviewed by Debra Gaynor for Reader Views (10/06)  From the moment I saw the cover of this book I knew that I would find pain within.  The pain of a young man facing the abusive life he's survived.  "Emmy, the events we lived through taught me to be sure of nothing about other people.  They taught me to expect danger around every corner.  They taught me to understand that there are people in this world who mean you harm.  And sometimes they're people who say they love you."  Chillingly Matt recounts the night he sneaked into the kitchen and took an Oreo.  His mother, Nikki, held a knife to his throat and cut him, to teach him to never again steal. This is just one incident in the nightmare he calls childhood.   Matt's father was gone but Matt couldn't blame him, after all he too was terrified of Nikki.   For a while Murdoch seemed to offer some protect from their mother, but, he too found himself unable to cope with the destructive behavior of Nikki.  He cared but was it enough?  Matt knew it was up to him.  He knew he had to find a way to get his two sisters and himself away from, their mother, Nikki, before she destroyed them all.  Matt turned to his father Ben for help, but Ben was too afraid of his former wife to rescue his own children.  This is the story of a brother's attempt to protect his younger sister from their abusive mother. The story is told in the format of letters from Matt to his dear sister, Emmy, trying to explain and warn her about life with their abusive mother.  "As I sit here writing, part of me hopes that you go along happily your whole life and never need or want to know the details."  This book is painful to read.  But it should be read.  There are many children facing the same situation and we, as society, must stop turning our backs on our precious children.  This book is well written.  The type is large enough for tired eyes to easily read it.  The characters are so real that you cry for them.  I found myself wanting to snatch them from their mother's insane antics and give them safety.  I highly recommend "Rules of Survival" for older youth and adults. +books
All quilters should have this book+P+When I have a question about quilting techniques, this, and "The Quilter's Ultimate Visual Guide" are the two references I go to find the answers.  This book is so loaded with valuable information, which would benefit both the beginner and advanced quilter. +books
Once in a Lifetime+P+For anyone interested in birds, birdwatching, or following your dreams this is a good read. For a teenager to have such a year as recounted here and be able to write in an entertaining way is truly a treat. Highly recommended+books
Surprise - people eat things other than than french fries!+P+A fun introduction to foods that we do not usually think of as comestible. No recipes for newt eyes though, but there are recipes for mice, rats, grasshoppers and pretty much anything else that can creep, crawl or walk. People in other parts of the world make do and enjoy many items that may be very tasty which we would abhor the thought of even eating, even when faced with starvation. French fries and hamburgers aren't everything+books
well documented+P+Watching Fred over the years has brought me alot of respect for the game.  This book brings me more respect for him as a person.  We all wonder what it takes to be a superstar, this book details that very thing.  I am proud  to see a writer who can step inside and describe a person like kathlene  bissle did.  Fred touches so many people in our precious game of golf.  We  Fred thank you and your author for allowing us to step inside of your life  an explore+books
From book to memories+P+I remember reading this book as a child and loving it. Now 21 and in my 3rd year of college, I come back to the memeories of this book and the stories. Still vivid in my mind is the picture of Little Bear going outside in the cold weather only to return home asking his mother for something warm to wear and in the end relazing he had his own fur coat all along, and then him taking off to the moom.   I'm studying to become a teacher and making a book list for one of my classes and this is sure to be on there+books
Pure egotistical, twisted accounts of the truth.+N+This book is exactly that. I know Mr. Morehouse and one of the people he writes about in this book... my father, Mel Riley. All I can say is, you should read Paul Smith's accounts if you want the truth pertaining to the Stargate and RV stories. There is also a documentary, if you can find it, made be Discovery BBC called "The Real X-files" featuring a true and honest view of RV and it's history with the military and all those involved. Giving this book much more than 1 star is really admitting lack of intelligence. +books
A Wonderful Book!+P+This is visually beautiful book that tells a beautiful story.  This is a story of courage and strength.  Togo's story needs to be told.  I even purchased a copy for my son's elementary school library+books
A View into How Intelligence Works+P+It appears the the release of previously secret information from World War II will never end. In this book, the authors have examined the files of the British Air Intelligence (AI) for every scrap of information they could find on every airplane that the Germans had.   Then they organized this information so that each airplane has a chronological report of what the British learned, when, and from what source. The main sources are photo recon (PR), prisoner interrogation, and examination of crashed planes.   From a standpoint of studying the planes themselves, there are only a few tidbits of new data (and some of the things that the Brits learned were wrong and didn't show up until later). From the view of trying to see what the British were learning and how they learned it it is a fascinating piece of work.   It gives an insight into how intelligence is gathered. It makes it much easier to understand about how big intelligence lapses (Pearl Harbour, 9/11) can happen.   A specialized book, but very interesting+books

Chilling+P+Whether or not astrology can help to predict events, this book gives many examples of how astrology has been used by people throughout a very long history.  Although mention is made of a time when common folk, such as those attending the theater, understood astrological portents as a part of everyday life, the book emphasizes how famous and highly-intelligent people made use of astrology for worldwide matters, as well as for practical, personal application such as the time of death (even though some, given the knowledge, tried and failed to change the event).  Choosing to elevate the traditional approach over the modern, psychological method is debatable, but the traditional progression in the book from Hitler to Bush is quite chilling.  Well worth the read+books
fiction should be called fiction+N+There are numerous factual errors that have been refuted in numerous places and unfortunately the author takes potshots and makes false accusations and individuals who are dead and unable to refute his charges.  If you want to read this fine, just remember that even though it's in print doesn't make it true or accurate+books
Biblical Creation attempts to be a science+N+Morris believes that the Bible can be scientifically proven.  This is impossible, since the Bible is a religious text.

Terrible+N+Simply disastrous work by Pohl. After throroughly enjoying the original Gateway, I was looking forward to this sequel. My hopes were utterly shattered. In summary, here is why this book was totally unreadable. 1. The main characters, Stan and Estrella, are totally unbelievable. Their dialogue is only slightly above kindergarten level. They are never given any motivation for their actions. 2. Pohl fills the pages with useless details, including information about plantlife, and cooking, as well as vomitting and bowel movements. I gave up on the book completely when he decided to indulge in an entire page about one man going to the toilet. Maybe he was trying to be funny. It didn't work. 3. Total lack of plot development. The book is basically a loosely connected series of random events, stuffed with filler. Mid-way through the book Pohl begins to introduce entirely new characters in an attempt to generate some kind of plot momemntum. I have never read a more unfocussed science fiction novel. It comes off as really poorly done space-opera. 4. Characters are completely flat. Stan and Estrella are both sickeningly dumb. Every other character is the exact same cardboard cutout. Aliens act just like humans except they talk funny. It is very cheesy and lacks any attempt at originality.  5. Book has an insane number of sex scenes, and they are all badly written. I mean literally, you cannt go more than 15 pages without a sex scene. So juvenile.  I would go on, but I believe my point is made. This book has not a single redeeming feature. If you enjoyed Gateway, DO NOT ruin your memory of it by reading this sequel.+books
A Weighty Tome+P+Alan F. Segal's book "Life After Death" is my first read of his work, and certainly the most massive book I have read in some time. Considering the sheer scope of the topic Segal has attempted to cover, the size of the book should come as no surprise. However, the physical weight is where the "weightiness" ends.  Now, before you freak out about over 700 pages of text on life after death, it should be emphasised that Segal writes in a very accessible and easy going manner. A few of the words he uses require a dictionary, (at least, I needed one), but the incidence of this was not a burden. Segal keeps you moving and presents a great level of quotation from ancient sources to highlight his points. His manner and style of presentation and discussion are absolutely fantastic.   Segal presents the beliefs of different cultures from a more social viewpoint than anything, and deals with how these beliefs can illustrate what the people thought of about themselves and the world about them. What you end up with is a very interesting discussion not just on life after death, but also some of the political, cultural and social concerns that went into them. This makes for a very well-rounded discussion.  Segal takes you through various cultures and civilisations, and throughout he inter-connects various ideas between them to show how they illustrate each other by contrast or simularity. These cultures include chapters on Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia and Canaan, Israelite, (broken into various chapters), and much more, including detailed chapters on Christian views and their development through the centuries.  This book is really a great overview of the topic, and it is relatively easy to find from Segal's referencing further material for more specific reading. Segal has done exceptionally well to squeeze such a vast topic into about 750 well-written and dynamic pages.  This book gets a big "thumbs-up" from me. I will certainly be reading more of Segal's work in the future+books
A concise and beatiful rendition about the history of India+P+This is a thoughtful and well researched book. It answers some of the questions which bother most Indians are we aryans or dravidians, how did the indus valley civilization dissappear . The manner in which they explain  the myths like the one about the vijayanagar empire tells us about the  research put in by the authors. I would recommend this book to novices as  well as connosieurs of Indian histor+books
Thorough Account of the Politics and Policy Behind the War+P+Robert Mann, a former congressional aide, fails to disappoint in his comprehensive political history of the nation's longest war.  Mann focuses on the politics and policy that led to the worst military defeat in American history.    For the most part, "A Grand Delusion" turns its gaze away from the action on the ground in Indochina, examining instead the decisions that policymakers in Washington faced during the war, the political pressures brought to bear on them, and the choices that they made over the course of twenty-five years.  Mann finds the roots of American involvement in the bitter political debates that erupted following the "loss" of China and North Korea's invasion of its southern neighbor, as President Truman suffered mortal political damage from his apparent inability to stem the Communist tide in Asia.  From those disasters, American policymakers took the first of several dangerous delusions: no politician could survive if he allowed an Asian country to fall to a communist government.    As the situation in South Vietnam deteriorated in the face of a virulent and effective communist insurgency, US government officials stirred more "delusions" into the policymaking mix: after the debacle at Munich in 1938, the West must always use force against its enemies, regardless of the nature of the threat or the national interests implicated; the VietCong guerillas were communists first and nationalists second, with their foremost goal the spread of global Communism and not national independence from the French; the unification of Vietnam under Communist leadership would threaten other American allies in Southeast Asia; America's national security depended on the success of the South Vietnamese government; and South Vietnam was ultimately capable of mustering the will, the political reforms, and military capability to defend itself, provided that the US stood by it until it could do so.  Each of these assumptions, according to Mann, was disastrously wrong.  Mann charts how these assumptions, like the progression of a fatal illness, infected every step of the policymaking process, leading five presidents to escalate America's involvement.    Mann guides the reader through the internal debates that led policymakers down this dangerous path, showing how officials from both parties clung to these false assumptions and how these delusions informed their decisions.  Mann pays special attention to the relationship between the White House and the Senate, the branch of Congress that the Founders expected to have more of a role in foreign affairs because of its longer terms and power over appointments and treaties.  Perhaps the most tragic figure in this book is Senator Mike Mansfield, the majority leader through much of the war, who suppressed his doubts about the war out of political loyalty to the President and the sense that the Senate must not undermine the Commander in Chief in a time of war.  Indeed, much of the book is a story of how Congress threw aside its constitutional responsibilities to declare war and provide oversight to the Executive's foreign policy, and how it slowly reclaimed those powers.  The book has a few defects.  The book contains far too many spelling and grammatical errors.  Also, at times, the narrative bogs down in bureaucratic minutiae, leaving some passages as interesting as a typical inter-office memo.  Still, the book is a noteworthy addition to the literature of the Vietnam War by reminding us how it came about and why.  If anything, it has only become more relevant since it was first published: readers will find haunting parallels, for instance, between Vietnamization and "As Iraqis stand up, we will stand down."      +books
This lays out all the ways we women keep getting beaten down...+P+Here it is now, 2006, and we have moved back into the 50's in so many ways. Look at so many 20 somethings like Paris Hilton and the ways she disgraces herself without any inkling that she is doing it. Look at all the role models we see in films and TV, where women are either bitches, promiscuous, or over-siliconed airheads. Thank God Howard Stern is no longer on TV. We've come a complete 180 degrees, and women get no respect. I don't think Hilary Clinton and Condoleeza are any help. The women we see in public have no conception of how their public imcompetence, stupidity and general buying into the concept of woman as sex object for men has hurt us.  Now men feel free to dispose of their wives by killing them. The number one cause of death of pregnant women is by homicide. Let a woman with a history of being abused by her boyfriend go missing, and the cops don't bother to look for her.  It's OK to the authorities if young women get killed. Who cares except the grieving family? It's common in high schools for girls to be physically abused by their boyfriends, and the girls still love and protect them.  Women are to be used, abused, and disposed of.  Our society is run by men, for men, and it has not changed one bit in the past one hundred years. We can't even decide for ourselves anyomore if we want an abortion.  Daddy government says no. All the right wing "Christians" running the country really just want to keep women in the dark ages before abortion, barefoot and pregnant and out of the work force. And women DON'T EVEN GET IT! I am currently packing to move to Scandanavia where women are respected and treated as equals. Birth control, abortions and prostitution are legal and accepted. Unlike America, in a few countries women at least own their own bodies+books
Mastering scanner stuff buying+N+This book should have been called "What can you buy if you are thinking about playing with scanner", and it is good at that. It does not tell you much about scanning, it is more about buying equipment, and possibly software related to scanning. Just think about it: There is a chapter "Where to buy", and a chapter "Buying on ebay". There is no chapter "Do this if you miss shadow detail", though. This book is aimed at a high school student who is doing his/her first steps with a film camera and wants to get those pictures into the computer (is there such a person these days?) The book even mentions cross processing. No, it does not say what should you do if you need to scan a cross-processed film. It just says that you can process your film in the wrong developer and it will affect the image on the film.  I was greatly impressed by the chapter on sending off your slides for scanning. Well you definetly need a book to tell you that you can do that, and it greatly improves your scanning skills If I had a chance to look at the book at the local store I would not ever buy it. Now it goes back to Amazon+books
An excellent resource for an excellent tool!+P+So, what happens is, you're playin' with a bunch of Nashville dudes, see? They're cuttin' this song, and the big-shot says, &quot;progression is 1, 4, 5 ... the chorus goes: 4, 5, 6minor - three times; fourth time, it goes  4, 5, 1.&quot; What do you do? You go, &quot;what key is it in?&quot;  'Course, you should be able to figure that out by a quick listen, and a tap  or two on your guitar ... but even if you don't, someone's bound to think  you're just lazy, and blurt out, &quot;It's in G, man!&quot; So, okay ...  big deal. You can count! You know the song goes G, C, D ... exept in the  chorus, which goes C, D, Em - three times, and then C, D, G the fourth  time. The cool thing about it, is when the vocalist arrives and he/she  can't sing in the key of G! ... it has to be in the key of D! Nothing  changes. The progression is still 1, 4, 5, etc. -- only now you're starting  from D as #1 and counting. So, now we're gonna play D, G, A ... and the  chorus goes G, A, Bm - three times; fourth time is G, A, D. Pretty simple,  huh? Everybody can do their private math, quietly, and, in ten minutes when  the tape starts to roll, everybody sounds like they knew what was up all  the time. The vocalist is very impressed! And, most of all, the guy cutting  the checks is smiling+books
would not recommend+N+we are in the logistics business and I reviewed this book as a potential teaching tool for management. The book is unfortunatley of little to no value. Most concerning is that the mathematics for inventory management, a critical factor in understanding logistics, are simply wrong. Even a quick look by anyone familiar with inventory management would find this concerning.+books
The best inn ever+P+This book is so funny because of the character's attitude. It even has strong words, like "makintosh".But I like it best because it has poems that rhyme+books
Julian Cameron Perseveres+P+The third in Ms. Cameron's trilogy continues her writing legacy. I'll get my bias right out front -- I purchased dozens of "The Artist's Way" more than a decade ago, and continue to gift friends with "The Vein of Gold" and "Walking in the World." Hers are about the only books I buy in hardback because I know I'll return to them again and again. It's not just the guidance that makes her books so compelling. Her phrasing, syntax, ability to draw the reader into her environment and circumstances, makes me keep coming back for more. She is a great story teller, as well as generous with her insights.  That said, her third volume is a bit like watching a train wreck. Especially Chapter 5, as we enter the abyss with her, I began to feel some cracks in the foundation of daily pages and artist's dates. It appears that Ms. Cameron is struggling with her own advice -- "keep the drama on the page." And some of us may feel our own resolve begin to crumble. But as the book progresses, the theme of perseverance certainly proves its value.   Those of us who feel we know Ms. Cameron recognize instantly why she would be walking on mental eggshells. Not only is she not going back to Taos this summer, but she also has chosen to close out her artist's series with this third book. Readers will miss both, and in that knowledge share a small bit of the grief that Ms. Cameron must be experiencing+books
READ The Wish Giver!!!!!!!!+P+In school my class and I read the book the Wish Giver. This book is about three kids who each receive a magic card from a small, chubby, mysterious little man named Thaddeus Blinn. When each child makes a wish , the wish turns out the wrong way. The moral of the story is "Be Careful what you wish for". This was a very interesting book. I really enjoyed it. Bill Brittain was a wonderful author. I highly reccomend this book.+books
Delaying the Real World+P+The best book for college grads to read.  Written by real people for real people.  It's a MUST BUY!!+books
Unfortunate+N+I am so sorry that I bought this book.  It is unfortunate that you do not have a Penguin or Everyman's Library edition.  First of all the book is too large to read in bed.  Secondly, whoever did the proofreading should be fired.  There are so many typographical errors that it really upsets and disturbs the reading.  If the postage were not so expensive from Israel, I would return the book to Amazon+books

Not what it says it is+N+This book would be more aptly titled, "Equiptment you could and should buy for photographing interiors".  It's designed for amateurs who don't know anything about photography and want to be walked through the process of buying the right equiptment and then left in the dark as to how to properly use it.  I know something about photography, and was looking for a book that would talk about photographing interiors and some exteriors.  I was interested in uses of perspective, lighting to add drama, that sort of thing.  The writer, once explaining the theory behind photographic principles, talks, not about how he was able to take successful pictures, but just that he did.  He mentions the equipment he used and tells where he set it up, but for all his superflous text, leaves the reader with only the knowledge of how to re-create his shot in the same location under the same conditions. It began as an interesting read, as he explained about what the pros use.  Then he explained what the beginner could buy, but why it's not really as good.  He showed a few examples of how lighting effects a scene and alters color, but in general, his "shooting by beginners on a tight budget" should be "shooting in these locations by beginners with several grand to spend on equiptment". I was hoping for a book that talked about the uses of lighting, the uses of color, actually shooting something besides huge, open, commercial structures.  This is my first return to Amazon+books
149 VS 92+N+There are 149 5 star reviews and 92 one star reviews.  This is more representative than an analysis based only on the last 20 reviews. But what is more notable than that is the fact that  the five star reviews tend to recieve a resounding thumbs down from the people who have read them.  Lone Nut Theorists can only bash and discredit their opposition since their story is false.  Posner totally disregards the Parkland Hospital Doctors statements regarding the neck wound as a wound of entry or the massive rear exit wound in the back of the head. He would also have us believe a high powered rifle shot to the head would not cause movement in the direction of the shot. That somehow our body would jerk back in the opposite direction and cause a large entrance wound and a small exit wound contrary to the numerous eyewitness accounts.  To expect us to believe this nonsense is insulting.         +books
Rambling and Overbearing+N+This book was arcane and verbose which made it very difficult and unenlightening.  The author digresses often and seems to add-in superfluous commentary on unrelated subjects.   His references often point to "current events" which have long since lost relevance and the entire text has a dated, maze-like feeling.  If you're looking for an account of the life of St. Francis of Assisi, I would not recommend this book.  If you are familiar with the life of St. Francis and are looking for a commentary on the events of his life you may find this work helpful due to its supposed eminence among works about the saint+books
Weight Loss is NOT PERMANENT!+N+I found out that there isn't any difference with Adkins for Life from the first book.  Disappointing,  I tried both with a group of folks from work and we all have had the same results.  However, I never support anything unless I have been convinced it truly does what it says and I found that with "the average joes diet."  A friend told me about it and I was always considered the fat girl.  No longer! and it's stayed off.+books
beauty is an attitude+P+A book on style that starts from the inside--yes, please! It's great to feel good in your clothes, but that's frosting on the cake. To feel beautiful inside and out takes so much more than a great scarf or well-cut jacket (fabulous as those are!), and this book is one of the very few that truly recognizes that. It's a shame that some people spend a huge amount of time and money on trying to perfect their outer image without realizing that there are people who feel (and are!) beautiful in thrift-store clothes and there are people wearing clothes from Vogue and W who feel flawed and ugly. This book goes much deeper than many books on style, and for that reason it's a fantastic addition to the books that focus only on fashion tips+books
Blatant puppetry of the anti-Bush movement+N+The title of the book certainly was a great inducement to buy the book.  Thinking that it would be an informed commentary on key elements of Bush's character, I purchased this book and eagerly awaited its arrival.    Starting off well, the author lays out what he purports to be the architecture of a meaningful and detailed analysis.  Then, sadly it degenerates into a self serving diatribe filled with epithets and derogatory terms.    Whether or not you support the President, any credible review of his actions from a psychiatry perspective should at least appear unbiased.  Not the case here.  Mr. Frank quickly descends into child like name calling and remarks that should never come from a professional.  He cites theories from others that indicate it is impossible to accurately apply a diagnosis without lengthy study, then in the next few paragraphs violates that premise by applying the very diagnosis he earlier claimed was impossible.  Finally, (and I have learned my lesson here) the final words of the book are a call for Bush's impeachment.  What that has to do with an unbiased psychological analysis I have no idea.  I now will read the final paragraph from any book Mr. Frank writes to understand his motivation before sharng my hard earned money with him.  Unless you are a closed minded rabid Bush hater, this book will not appeal to you.  If you are of such ilk, just rewards are yours for the reading+books

recommended+P+For me, there are two key assertions in Robert Adams' "Beauty in Photography".  First, that we "live in discouraging hours of society's apparent decay" (p. 88).  Second, that the purpose of art is to "help us meet our worst fear, the suspicion that life may be chaos and that therefore our suffering is without meaning" (p. 25).  From these two assertions Adams develops his interpretation of photography: Photography detects, extracts and emphasizes the beauty around us, and by doing so it points toward something deeper in the world, an organizing power, a coherence supporting the world and our lifes.  To Adams, photography is a spiritual exercise, making bearable an otherwise decaying sourrounding.  Art not concerned with depicting the world beautifully is, to Adams, mere "decoration".  Thus, Adams tells us little interesting about most modern art, and his approach does not generalize, for instance, to music.  That beauty can exist as such, that it can tell us something about ourselves even without refering to things in the world: This does not seem to be Adams experience.    In these very conservative views I disagree with Adams.  Still, I recommend his essays to anyone who wants to understand why some photography is moving us while other is not.  Even if Adams is not telling the whole story -probably nobody will- he is an excellent writer who talks about art in a clear and understandable way.  The only disappointment with the book was the poor reproduction quality of the images depicted.  As a publisher specializing in photography books Aperture could do better+books
very intelligent, ground-breaking book!!!+P+Judith Butler's study of Antigone, over the course of these 3 lectures, yields important and timely insights about how we might understand kinship and love in today's society. Her analysis of Hegel, Levi-Strauss, and Lacan is impressively rigorous. A must read for anyone interested in liguistics, structuralism, feminism and contemporary questions about political belonging.+books
Dolphins+P+This book is about dolphins. A baby doilphin is born. The book tells how the mother dolphin has a baby. First the baby dolphin's tail comes out. Then his head comes out too. Then it tells how a baby dolphin is protected by its family. My favorite part was when the baby dolphin was born. I think other kids will like this book because they will learn about dolphins+books
inflammatory, there are better books out there on the subject+N+The things that most struck me was the book was more "attacking" than setting up positive models.  I found the language to be quite inflammatory and harsh.  This made it very unpleasant to read.  For a much better book on house-churches, try "Houses that change the world" by Wolfgang Simson+books
disappointing+N+Peter Falk's book was nothing but a few stories.  He only talks about a few Columbo episodes, He is so brief and uninteresting. Also , he talks about his buddies too much. Who cares about John Cassavetes!  He talks like he's some filmmaking genius.   If you want to read about Peter Falk and his life as an actor, it's sadly left out. He doesn't even talk about how he met his wives.  Sadly, a very dissappointing book.   Not recommended!   +books
Wonderful Premise Handled With Great Skill+P+I cannot claim to know much about Philip K. Dick as this is, thus far, the only one of his novels I have read.  But based on a reading of The Game-Players of Titan, it will not be the last.  The premise of the inhabitants of Earth playing the game, Bluff, for spouses and land is wonderful and the story only grows weirder and more original with each passing chapter.  The only small quibble is the ending is somewhat anti-climatic after the strongly built, witty, creatively heightened build up but this book is about the journey and one could have no better guide than the author for this unique trip+books
Overated+N+Based on the previous 5-star rave reviews written here, I decided to give this book a try, especially since it's two books for the price of one.  But when I opened up the book, I discovered that you don't even get Mackay's complete book; you get just the chapters relevant to finance/investing.  Because I was reading the book primarily for insight into trading/investing I thought I would make do.  However there was very little of that to be found, and when it was found, it was typically written in verbose, archaic English, sandwiched between many pages of irrelevant historical minutea such as how exactly transactions were conducted in the 1700's.  There are a couple good gems, but nothing which has not been repeated in more modern books in much simpler language.  E.g. The Money Game by Adam Smith or Market Wizards, or Mindtraps by Barach or any of Tony Oz's books.  There are sooo many good trading books out there to read that reading this was a complete waste of time+books
Boring+N+I saw the author during a book signing on television.  I saw a young, intelligent, articulate lady who had some very interesting ideas about American culture.  I picked up the book to learn more about her and her ideas.  Unfortunately, though there is a lot of meat in this book, simply put, I was bored...bored...bored.  This is not a subject I take lightly and believe me, I wanted to like this book because I like the author.  I have to agree with a lot of the reviewers here.  There is a lot of data and no real point.  A lousy effort and there are few people more disappointed than me+books

Nan is a character full of flaws - as well as heart - who will stay with you year-round.+P+Twenty-eight-year-old Nan Cloutier always thought that, by the time she was twenty-five, she would be living a posh, fabulous life in Manhattan, with a great job, an even greater wardrobe, and the guy of her dreams by her side. Three years later, and Nan still hasn't achieved all of the above, and then some. For Nan's so-called "posh" job is working for Seasonal Staffers, Inc. A corporation where she has held positions as a Cindy-Lou Who impersonator, Easter-Egg Carrying Girl In Bunny Suit, and Valentine's Day Purple Box of Chocolates, among other, much more humiliating titles. Which is why Nan is desperate enough to tell a little white lie. While posing as Cindy-Lou Who at the Merrier-Iverson Department Store Christmas display, Nan tells her boss - Mr. Iverson - that she can speak French, and pretends to converse with a French child, reciting her Christmas list to the English-speaking Grinch. After much praise, Nan is beaming from ear to ear, but her smile slowly fades when Mr. Iverson falls and breaks his leg - the fault of Nan, of course. Quickly getting canned from her Seasonal Staffers position, she is offered a new job - by Mr. Iverson - one that involves baby-sitting his grandson, Colm. However, upon meeting, Nan quickly realizes that Colm is actually her age, and that Mr. Iverson was actually playing "matchmaker" for his grandson, and thinks that the two will make the perfect couple - once they work out a few bumps in the road.  I have read many of Naomi Neale's YA books - published under the name Naomi Nash - which is why I was extremely eager to experience one of her adult chick lit books for myself. I was pleasantly surprised, for, from page one, I found Nan's character to be amusing, what with her somewhat...unusual career choice, and the wisecracks she litters throughout all of her observations on being a Seasonal Staffer, and life, in general. She is the ideal protagonist and keeps you laughing from beginning to end, while the many bizarre people in her life will take readers by surprise - a pleasant one, of course - and lead them on a trip down lover's lane. Neale has done an amazing job of weaving together a tale filled with smart characters, witty storylines, and an emotional roller coaster to top it all off. Nan is a character full of flaws - as well as heart - who will stay with you year-round.  Erika Sorocco Book Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspape+books
you can't go wrong with Nabokov and Chess+P+This early Nabokov novel is not of the mindbending genius of later works like Pale Fire and Lolita, but it is still better than even the best work by many other writers.   Nabokov is a brilliant stylist and imagines the world of his protagonist brillantly. The phrasing is sparse and compelling, but as the main character's mind starts to disintegrate, so does the book. The last third is a bit of a disppotment. A disappointment only because its a nabokov novel, and I've come to expect such great things for him. Its worth the time, especially if you have an interest in chess, but I'd read his later works first+books
Weak summary of the E-Myth Revisited.+N+This book is a watered down version of the E-myth Revisited, which is a good book. The E-Myth Contactor - is a summary of M. Gerber's program with "contractor stories." There is no true insight into the contactor industry. My guess is this is the 1st of many books focusing on specific industries. My advice is to skip this book, just purchase Gerber's E-Myth Revisited & make the connections yourself+books

With any luck, this will be last time Nick Hasted is ever asked to write about important figures in music, such as Eminem, whom I love. He simply lacks the skill or flair required to tell the story in a pacy, engaging and believable fashion+books
Encyclopedia of Spelling Errors...+N+You can read some of the other reviews to get an idea of some of the specific errors...  The book is loaded with them from wrong moves to other typos...  How can this book help anyone if half the battle is trying to figure out whats going on...  He has quotes from people in years that they already were dead...  Games with wrong year and people listed...  Sad that they still publish books from this author...  I do not understand why they let books out with so many errors...  When I buy a chess book I expect it to have almost no errors...  This book has more errors than actual things that help players...  If you give this to someone and tell them to find all the errors...  They woudl probably have grandkids and still not find them all...  I dunno what he means by Golden Nuggets...  I think more work went into thinking of name of book than content...  Books like this give chess books a bad name to say very least...  If you want a book on chess strategy try Watson's Advances since Nimzo...  Even The Mammoth Book of Chess will help you more than this item...  Perhaps even consider Silman's Strategy Grandmaster Techniques from A to Z book.  Hopefully one of those books might help you in your game and give you value for your dollar..+books
This Debut is the Pits+N+It's summer, and Parker County, Texas, is gearing up for the annual Peach Festival.  That includes retired teacher Phyllis and her friend and boarder Carolyn.  Both women always enter the cooking contest.  Carolyn usually wins, and Phyllis is determined to beat her this year.  While the two women are out picking peaches, the farm's owner dies.  His death could be ruled an accident, but it might also be murder.  Phyllis's son, an officer with the sheriff's department, investigates.  Unfortunately, he can't find any conclusive evidence one way or the other.  The day of the peach festival brings another death.  Head judge Donnie Boatwright keels over just after trying Phyllis's spicy peach cobbler.  This is a clear case of murder, however.  The man was poisoned.  When Phyllis is quickly cleared of suspicion, the police turn their attention to Carolyn.  Phyllis knows her friend couldn't have done it.  But can she prove it?  The book showed promise at the beginning.  The first death took place in the first chapter.  But then it quickly went downhill.  Once Donnie dies, the book focuses all the attention there.  Still, very little seems to happen.  The characters, Carolyn especially, aren't really that likeable.  And the writing style is fairly poor, with dangling modifiers and awkward sentences throughout the book.  Even the three recipes in the back of the book could have used a bit more detail.  The book sounded promising, so I'm very sorry I can't recommend it.  I won't be visiting Phyllis again+books
More Than Just A Coming Of Age Story For a Vietnamese Refugee. +P+The book "A Sense Of Duty: My Father, My American Journey" is really an American story about coming of age and about father son relationships but with a huge twist of circumstances. We are dealing with a family torn apart by the loss of the Vietnam War and their subsequent separation. Author Quang X. Pham is shipped to the USA after the fall of Saigon with his siblings and mother. His father who is a member of the South Vietnamese Air Force stays behind doing his duty to the very end. Thus begins 12 years of imprisonment in the so called "re-education camps" while his family adjusts to a new life in America.   The author deals with cultural and language issues and some degree of racism and bigoted treatment. However, the deeper issue for him is not having his father there for him. There is also his lack, at that young age, to fully realize the significance of what his father had done with his life and how well he had served his old country. The book is an eye opener for those of us who have wondered what it was like for these new comers to our shores.    When his father does come to the USA after being released from the "camps" he found it tough going. His marriage fell a part and he found that all those lost years with his children, who had grown up without him, haave created a huge gap between them. His children do not really know or understanding who is or even who he was.   The book follows the growing appreciation and understandings that Quang eventually gains for his dad. As he learns more about his father's past and sees his personal courage and sense of duty and what drove him to become the man he was.  When the author himself wears the uniform of Marine aviator and fights in the Gulf War, he begins to gain more insights on the sacrifices that his dad had made for his own country of South Vietnam. We take this spiritual and emotional journey with the author as he gradually begins to sense what factors and motives drove his father on his own personal journey.  The book also details and addresses some old history from that time period and that war. Most Americans have either forgotten or never knew about our national attitudes and polices with regard to the war and lack of regard for our allies the South Vietnamese. It may make for some interesting but uncomfortable reading.   It is a well-written and poignant story that embraces two very different wars. His story unites two different generations into an emotional bridge between father and son. It is touching and deeply moving. The author does a great job of making the reader feel a part of the experience. This book receives the Military Writer's Society of America's highest book rating of FIVE STARS!   This book also receives my personal endorsement+books
Ding Dong - the doorbell rang+N+The photo presented here is a bit too bright and the faces are not that orange in this paperback edition's cover. However you can get a feel for the checked floor and how after opening the pages of The Doorbell Rang you get an eye sore with the blue checkered tablecloth in the kitchen with the blue stove and red appliances. The mother and daughter are both redheads and there is a black cat that hangs around during the story that takes place in the kitchen.   With just twenty pages my seven-year old breezed through the book in six minutes. The favorite character in the book according to my son is the cat and watching where he was throughout the story. The Doorbell Rang begins with a Mother placing a plate of cookies on the kitchen table for her son Sam and daughter Victoria. " I've made some cookies for tea, said Ma". The children each took six cookies comparing the look and smell of these cookies to Grandma's.  By flipping through the pages of the Doorbell Rang it looks like the kitchen table got bigger, but upon further inspection the same number of chairs are there, but more kids around the table and fighting over the seats. The cat is making his way around the kids to receive pats on the head and attention. More kids arrived bringing a bicycle and a doll carriage and the table shows each kid with one cookie. It is hard to tell if the cookies are on white plates or that is just part of the checkered tablecloth. The serving plate is clearly empty at this point and all the kids turn to see the latest bell ringer. Meanwhile over at the stove the steam is continuing but at a larger pace and it looks like fresh water now in the orange pail.   The final arrival for this story is Grandma, with a large cookie sheet type tray carrying freshly baked chocolate chip cookies. All the kids leave the table to greet her and the cat ends up alone on the kitchen table. Not very sanitary as far as I am concerned and my son noticed no napkins or drinks at the table. The dirty floor was bothering him as well and he wondered why the kids never took their shoes off for that is something we all do upon entering our home.    The portrayal of the Mother and how the stove was not being attended and having the cat on the table bothered me. The kids not stopping to wipe their feet or hanging up their own belongings and no one washing their hands before having a cookie and who knows how many times the kids each touched one of them.   At least the kids were dressed nice and the bucket of water never spilled and the Mother finally sat down. For a new reader this might be a fun read but for more than one read I highly doubt there would be interest. There is a lot of repetition with the arrival of new kids and then the sharing of the cookies while comparing them to each child's Grandma's cookies. There are roughly two to four sentences on each page. The good news is that my son did not ask for any cookies after reading this+books
verbosity should be verboten+N+I am really impressed with the good ratings this book has gotten so far. I hate it.  The authors incapability to explain the multinational context in simple terms, his approach to pack every little, tiny detail that somehow might correlate to the overall subject into each chapter, and his inability to use formulas and graphs in an understandable way, makes me wonder if the author actually knows what he is talking about. I find this financial book the worst I had to deal with so far. As an honor student with a finance major I feel like Shapiro is trying to hard to create a book that covers all. His examples and illustrations are somewhat interesting since they provide some information on how things work in the real world, but they lack something really important that I personally find essential for demonstration purposes: clarity and comprehensiveness.  Additionally, I find his approach to verbally describe his calculations in huge paragraphs disturbing. As disturbing is his way to create his own symbols and acronyms and not using those other financial books use. When studying you therefore need so much time in figuring out, what his symbols actually mean, that you would rather read another book.  I personally doubt that Shapiro has actually understood the subject himself. He is using the trick I always use when I do not want my professors to notice my lack of understanding: verbosity. Quantity is not always good.   I would definitely simplify the book and use clearer formulas, a more mathematical approach, better graphs, more information on how these formulas could be derived, less words, fewer sub-chapters,  more interesting case studies at the end of the chapters, more problems for self-evaluation at the end of the chapters, clearer examples and illustrations....  There is so much room to improve that it might be better to rewrite the whole book using a better author.+books
Daddy's little princess?+P+Out of the despair of a young woman needing guidance and  affirmation for her existence, MY SOUL TO HIS SPIRIT is born. Melda Beaty longed for the type of love that tells a young  girl she has worth, beauty and unlimited potential. For a  male love that is disconnected from possession, obsession or  penetration; love that only a father can give. Never knowing  that magnitude of love, she harbored ill feelings for her  father. Traumatized since she was a little girl, her  nightmares ended only after she became a woman with a  legitimate voice, and truly forgave her father.  Since her atonement, Ms. Beaty has been blessed to meet and  share stories with other Black women with similar histories  of overwhelming father-daughter relationships. Relationships  that more often than not, define how we relate to the men in  our lives. MY SOUL TO HIS SPIRT speaks of the totality of our  lives as black women and the full spectrum of kinship with  our fathers.  MY SOUL TO HIS SPIRIT does not  bash fathers, however, it does  present a penetrating view from every possible angle. The six  powerful chapters, Loving: Daddy's Girl; Distant: Every Once  in Awhile; Abandon: One Day He Was Gone; Non-Existent: Could  Pass Me on the Street; Amended: Time and Forgiveness Heals  All Wounds; and Deceased: Gone Too Soon, cover the gamut of  emotions daughters have felt for fathers. I applaud Ms. Beaty  and all the daughters who contributed to this book of healing  and strengthening for the family unit. I venture to say each  reader will be familiar with at least one of the offerings.  This is a humbling read; an epiphany.   Reviewed by aNN of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers+books
EXCELLENT RESOURCE!+P+I have been reading book after book for my upcoming police tests and this is by far the BEST book for interviews. The information I have learned from this book applies to almost ANY interview not just the police one. I found that I had already begun categorizing people so I knew how to communicate in their language in my interviews for my small business. I am excited to try these techniques in the police oral interview. I feel EXTREMELY prepared for the interview thanks to this book+books
Great for talking about "growing"+P+I used this with my class (3-5 year olds) and they sat so still, they really loved the book.  The story is heartwarming and the illustrations make you love the characters+books
Voo Doo Doctor+N+Sad to say this book is an embarrassment to both Psychiatry and the Christian faith.  However, neither should be blamed for the nonsense of a man who claims to represent both.  There is so much wrong with this book that it isn't worth getting into.  I find it highly ironic, though, that Peck is guilty of the same grievous sin and "malpractice" as the father of his character Jersey.  Jersey's father was a psychologist (not an M.D.), but use to put on a physician's coat when seeing patients.  Peck saw this as highly offensive and evil.  Yet he, a psychiatrist, had no qualms about pretending to be an exorcist and perhaps causing severe psychological, not to mention spiritual damage to his "patients."  If this book has any merit it lies in its ability to be a good case study on how not to practice psychiatry.  From reading his books I can't help but get the feeling that while Peck sincerely wanted to help people he was too caught up in himself.  Perhaps the enormous early success he enjoyed from "People of the Lie" did a trip on his mind.  I hope he and all those he treated can find healing.

Even better than the first one!!+P+I thought that LaHaye and Blackstock would never be able to duplicate and certainly not be able to top the writing in the 1st book of this series.  How wrong I was!!  This book is even better than the first!   I can now relate even more to the characters of Cedar Circle, and I feel like they are my best friends.  I can hardly wait to turn each page so I can find out what happens next. I am anxiously awaiting the opportunity to read the 3rd book, because I know I won't be disappointed+books
Nothing New, But a Good Refresher+P+Ziegler certainly gives an inside look into the business, but for me, having been to two Joe Verde seminars, it came as nothing new. For someone new to the business, I'd certainly recommened it. For someone with several years in the business, it'd still be a very good refresher course. It's all too easy to get into a "rut", and this book can help you see where your mistakes are possibly being made, so that you can correct them. It would also be a good read for a car buyer, as it would give them a lot of insight into how SOME dealerships conduct business.+books
The Worst Edition Possible+N+The New Page edition of this book is a true piece of cr*p! Every single page has multiple typographical errors, obviously deriving from shoddy proofreading of the text they scanned. I thought I could deal with it, but it reached the point where it was distracting, so I ordered the Dover edition instead. I was an idiot not to get that one in the first place. Don't repeat my mistake+books

Too much speculation+N+If you want to read about scientific facts this is not the book for you.  The scientific underpinnings of this speculative book are briefly mentioned and not elaborated upon in much detail.  It's better to just read his paper on the somatic marker hypothesis (which is disputed by the way).  Without a background in neuroscience it is difficult to evaluate his ideas in a serious way, and anyway he asks for introspection (a la William James) from the reader more than anything else+books

Begging to Differ+N+One wonders by what process a review gets chosen for featured status.  I must concur with the unfavorable reviews.  Warner treats the condemnation trial transcript as a privileged text.  She accords it all the authority of a definitive verdict from an impartial court.  It was neither.    It is unsound scholarship to attempt an uncritical reading of any trial whose conviction was later overturned on appeal.    Abundant evidence confirms that the original verdict was rigged and that parts of its transcript were falsified.  Warner barely acknowledges the retrial and offers little pretext for disregarding it.  This is the reverse of proper analysis.  If the twenty-five year gap between trials is an excuse for Warner's preference, then consistency demands that Warner accord still higher value to surviving letters from Joan of Arc's own lifetime.  She is not consistent.  A newcomer to Joan of Arc biography would do far better with Regine Pernoud's "Joan of Arc by Herself and Her Witnesses."  Pernoud's approach is to offer the reader relevant excerpts from original historic documents.  Organized thematically, Pernoud summarizes leading debates and invites readers to reach their own conclusions.  The work is admirably impartial.  Pernoud is perhaps the most respected twentieth century scholar of Joan of Arc+books
People can be so stupid!+P+I am constantly amazed at how stupid some people can be, and many are noted in this book. I'm fascinated by the subject matter. I enjoyed how the author presented the various cases - similar to Over the Edge: Death in the Grand Canyon. I would recommend this book+books
A PORTRAIT OF A MAN+P+This is the best book that I have read about Hemingway as a man. It doesn't pretend to be (and is not ) a biography. It is an intimate and  deligthful portrait of Hemingway the fisherman, the hunter, the womanizer, the drinker, the gambler and all the things that really  meant something to him. Were can you get such a descriptive account of the pain and insecurity associated with a writer's creativity?  Without this book one cannot size the tragedy of a writer that, in his last years, was conscious of his inability to create great literature, but was condemned to live up to his myth and  his character. To those that criticize this book, on grounds of lack of objectivity, one must oppose that this is a book about Papa like the one that he,  when Paris was a moveable feast,  would have wanted to write about Hemingway.........After all, if Papa lived, he would have explained to all of us that time is precious and that he took Hotchner under his wings, wined and dined and shared intimate thoughs and moments with him, only in order to provide the young lad with good story writing material. And Hotchner has delivered+books

Now I know why I didn't buy Morrison's run...+N+I really didn't enjoy this TPB that much, and it definitely enforced why I'm not that fond of Morrison's writing on any X title from Marvel. He brings the angst to the characters, and he writes them intelligently enough, but he also makes me dislike all of them. Even normally upright characters like Jean Grey and Cyclops were so twisted I forgot they were heroes in this. Yuck.  My main complaint is that I was hoping for a cleaner back history of Wolverine's Weapon H/Weapons Plus origin, and I really didn't get that from this at all. Instead, Wolverine's mission with Cyclops is tacked on as an untidy footnote to three (or four, I lost count) issues focusing on the love triangle of Emma Frost, Jean Grey, and Scott Summers. I thought the title of the TPB was misleading because of that.   The opening issue continues Jean's discovery of Scott's psychic infidelity with Emma. Jean barges into his thoughts and finds Emma dressed up in her old Phoenix costume, which was kind of tacky and bizarre, anyway, when you consider that Emma's old organization, the Hellfire Club, was responsible for Jean turning into Dark Phoenix and subsequently destroying herself. My first thought was, why would that be a turn-on? Very twisted scene. So, Jean strikes out at Emma, invading her mind and plowing through her most private memories as she searches for the first moment when they started their affair. Emma stays in character, not feeling as though she had done anything wrong by offering Scott salvation from his unhappy marriage, and calling Jean "a playground bully" hiding behind her righteous posturing. Pot calling the kettle...  That issue itself offered sympathy for Emma from unexpected sources, namely Hank and Logan, both of whom I automatically expected to side with Jean. In the meantime, all any of them did was blame Jean for the dissolution of her marriage by "not taking care of it sooner." That alone made me not like this story.  This arc was kind of odd going in because it was sandwiched between arcs of the other X titles without reflecting anything that was happening in the others. Bishp and Sage were both fresh from X-Treme X-Men, namely "Schism," after solving the Jeffery Garrett murders in Alaska. The second issue to this story arc features a murder mystery, since Emma is shot and shattered while in her diamond form. I've heard readers comparing it to Clue, but I don't give it that much credit, I thought the plotting was weak. I noticed that Sage and Bishop never once implicated Storm, who not only hates Emma, but who openly threatened her with hurling a spear at her carried by tornado-strength winds to see if she would shatter. Hello? Missed the boat there, Grant. I'm guessing Storm's name never came up simply because this wasn't her book. Oh well.  The motive for Emma's murder was kind of silly; two minor characters have a secret to hide in the farmhouse on the Xavier property, and Emma's prize pupils, the Stepford Cuckoos, know what's going on but won't spill their guts.  The Weapons Plus arc started with what was actually a satisfying confrontation between Logan and Scott at the Hellfire Club. The artwork was weird, though. I like Bachalo's work on Uncanny and New X-Men Academy, but he makes it darker, and the inks are heavy-handed. Bachalo draws the ugliest Cyclops I've ever seen, and his Wolverine looks like a gopher. In this scene, Cyclops tells Wolverine that he refuses to come back to the X-Men, but Logan instead recruits him for a big mission with Fantomex, an upgraded Weapons Plus graduate who clarifies that Logan was really Weapon Ten, not Weapon X as previously assumed. This was the most poorly written issue of this collection, and it jumped around too much for me to tell where the action was taking place. Somehow Logan and Scott ended up on an asteroid, presumably with help from E.V.A, Fantomex's ship. Somehow they managed to escape, leaving Logan behind to blow up the asteroid and destroy Weapon Fifteen. Morrison and Bachalo didn't even bother to pitch a knock-down, dragout battle between Logan and Fifteen that could have been the highlight of the story. It was a waste.  The jump from Jimenez's clean penciling to Bachalo's more cartoony style is very stark and does not work. I longed for Frank Quitely's pages instead, feeling he would have done a better job of conveying the images. As a lead-in to the much more important "Planet X" arc (still not one of my favorites, but better than this drivel), this book was very weak.  Overall, I'm sorry I spent the money on this story, and I will avoid Morrison's back issues going forward+books
Quilt Visions 2004+P+The book is beautifully produced. The quilts in the show are well documented and photographed. I received the book promptly and in excellent condition+books
Nice try, but full of errors+N+This book could be a great book for the unergrad intro to structures course.  It has a nice writing style, it is easy to understand, and has plenty of example problems.  However, it is FULL of errors.  It think someone in my class would find a new error at least once a week+books
Superficial Analysis +N+This book is good if you want to be warned over and over to wash your hands! If you are looking for the difference between viruses and bacteria, actual scientific references or interesting facts about how germs and bacteria live, reproduce and colonize us - look elsewhere. This book was too preachy and didn't have enough information for anyone with a genuine interest in biology, human physiology, or health.+books

S. King horror or childish nightmare?+N+I wasn't sure if this was from a S. King writing or some child night mare of a writing!   It's obvious that any one can write then have that book published.   Only the most outrageous of imagination could come with this fairy tale type of fantasia.  Sorry, but the author is searching for the truth in the wrong place! you Know?    +books
USELESS BUNK+N+Obviously, the rantings of a depressed, selfish and self-righteous woman, who for if these issues were not enough of a challenge, believes in the fraudulent and assanine thinking of Freud. To bad she didn't kick the bucket before she had the opportunity to launch such a demented attack on the very core of society, and what brings meaning to life: family. This sad woman's physical appearance, almost confirms the above alone - just a miserable, frustrated witch. +books
Very Misleading Book+N+There is much wisdom to be gained from Aboriginal culture, but the "wisdom" in this book is NOT Aboriginal, but rather made up by the author.  She should have based her book on real Aborigines and shared their true culture, or based it on a totally fictional population.  That way readers would not believe the lies she tells about Australia.  The book does make one think about the many flaws of our western culture which is good, but to do so while corrupting a native culture is simply appalling.  She should not be profiting from this book+books
Save your money+N+If you are a programmer and in a hurry to implement your own graphics filter then don't buy this book.  Its treament of the various formats is essentially devoid of any examples and detail.  A very superficial book with large fonts a &quot;buttons&quot; fulfilling the need to ensure bulk to the book at the expense of content.  There is no CD with example coding and decoding examples, very very few tables of giving a graphical view of the file structures.   In short it is a poorly presented and poorly written book...hardly worth $10 rather than the $25 they are asking....Go by the O'Reilly book Encyclopaedia of Graphics Formats...expensive for sure but it has what this book lacks and that is content+books
Always Lower Prices - but at what cost?+P+This is the central question in Featherstone's treatment of the Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. class action lawsuit. Focusing on depositions, sworn testimony and direct personal interviews, Featherstone gets right to the heart of her subject in the first chapter. The anecdotal evidence, supported by ample statistics, demonstrates that something is, indeed, awfully wrong with Wal-Mart and the disparate ways in which it treats its workers.   As important as the gender discrimination issue is the consideration of how Wal-Mart has, and will continue to, build its fortune off the backs of the working poor. Given enough time, it is entirely possible that certain areas of the country will be economically drained, committed to an addiction of buying at and working for Wal-Mart. It is the low-price panties version of a Super Size Me world. Worst of all, however, is the company's documented practice of referring its own workers to social service agencies, to apply for benefits they need because Wal-Mart neither provides sufficient benefits nor pays employees enough to afford them. Puts a whole new spin on the phrase "corporate welfare." Where is the politicians' indignation over this abuse of the welfare system?  Well researched and well documented with references and notes. One latter chapter does tend to slow down with emphasis on legal citations and stats, but this is necessary to put a factual basis behind the personal stories. Whether you are against Wal-Mart, a Wally-World fan or a blissfully unaware consumer, you cannot read this book and remain unaffected in some manner. If it does not turn you completely away from shopping there, it should at the very least give you pause before opening your wallet.   +books
A psycological mishap+N+Though this novel is supposed as a psycological materpiece I have found it to be sordid and incongruent. Stendhal should have spent less time on his discriptions of Julien Sorel's superficial love endeavors and  &quot;rendez-vous&quot; and more time on his character's true personality.  After reading 508 pages I found the main character to be a complete  stranger. All that was revealed about Julien was that he stuck to his  morals all the way to the end. Stendhal should have learned from his  creation's ideals and stuck to the basics+books
Fun Romp for Young Readers+P+My daughter is just learning to read, so she can manage only the simplest text when reading a book herself.

Started off so well....+N+The first book of this trilogy is the best. So rich in detail. Well defined characters. Such a good pace. It made me scour every bookshop I knew looking for the second and third books. When I found them, I got a distinct feeling that something or someone was rushing Ms. Hearn to finish the series...or she got bored with Japan....whatever the reason is it is to the detriment of the plot. You know when an unimaginative/bored person is telling a story? There's a lot of "and then...and then and then...". Hope you get my drift.+books
two stars is being nice.+N+It wasn't as impactful as I thought it would be.  Some of the people that gave comments gave some great comments and others, well, other gave comments.  The selection of people was a good cross section but it didn't have meaning to it.  I was looking for more in depth commentary.  Maybe what I was looking for should have been said between each of the comments in the book.  It might have looked like hugh just collected a bunch of email and old letters and thrown them together+books
101 things you never knew about Disneyland+N+The title of this book should be 101 Things You Really Don't Need to Know About Disneyland. It was a complete waste of money and not at all interesting to read+books
Need to pay extra for additional exercises+N+Buyer beware. After paying for this book, the DVD-rom will prompt you to pay another US$30 for 80 additional exercises. That's a hidden expense which is not mentioned in the product description. This is wrong. I suppose for a book which is not intended for the beginner, the author assumes that you have the extra cash to spend on the additional exercises+books
Excellent revelations, but Lucas should have updated it+P+Kahn did a great job in revealing Vader's, Luke's and Palpatine's motivations and thoughts.  However, a glaring problem was where Obi-Wan tells Luke about how he took him to live with his BROTHER Owen on Tatooine.  I know that was the original backstory, but with the prequels' release, we all know that Owen Lars REALLY IS Luke's step-uncle (since Owen is Anakin's step-brother).  Lucas had the time to write that cute little preface in the re-release of this book.  He should have bothered to change or at least ommit this inconsistent dialogue from the scene.  This is a better storyline anyway, since Obi-Wan wouldn't have known his real brother well, having grown up in the Jedi Temple+books
Good book, but.....+P+This is a very useful tool for real estate agents, & the letter templates are good. My only complaint is that they have a floppy disk included in the back of the book to download the forms onto your computer. If it had been a cd instead of a floppy, it would have been much better. Nothing wrong with the material, I can recommend the letters, but some computers don't even come with floppy drives anymore. If they'd switch to a cd, then they'd have a winner.+books
A unique work with a message for us in today's world+P+This is the first volume of Churchill's Noble Prize winning six part chronicle of World War II. The Gathering Storm depicts the rise of Hitler and the indifference of the leaders of the European democracies to the clouds of the gathering storm. Churchill incorporates contemporary documentation and his own reminiscence in this opening memoir.  Churchill was a great statesman with great literary ability - a winning combination. The Gathering Storm a unique work and has a message for us in today's world.    Read and reviewed by Jimmie A. Keple+books
Respect! That's what this books about...+P+Alt Ed is a very interesting book. It talks about all the stereotypes that teenagers have to put up with in high school. It shows how rude people can be to others. I liked how the kids had to get involved in the group. The group helped the kids open up to each other and to say what needed to be said. Without the group I think a lot of the kids would have gotten into even more trouble then they were in. This book is great if you want to teach others about respect and stereotypes+books
Not Bright Enough+N+This is one of my favorite authors.  I could hardly wait to open Burning Bright and get lost in London of the 1700's.  Well, lost I got!  Each page was more and more boring.  I read 3/4th of the book and donated it to the library.  After reading the other reviews I am glad I didnt finish the book and be completely disappointed with the weak ending. +books
A BIG WASTE OF TIME FOR THE EXAM+N+I would not even give this book ONE star if I had a choice!  Although some people state that this book may be informative and easy reading, and one poster even stated that it helped him pass a DIFFERENT exam, it fails miserably in preparing you for the 70-291 exam.  The book should have been titled "Some really really basic Windows Server Infrastructure info and JUST BARELY scratching the surface of the 70-291 exam!"  The book was short and easy reading and I aced all the questions at the end of each chapter.  But when I took a real practice test by SelfTest software, I got 5 questions out of 50 correct on my first try.  NOT A GOOD START for the exam which I wanted to take next week.  The questions on the practice test that I got wrong were NOT even covered in any respect in the book.  I've passed 70-290 and 70-270 and I can tell you that I know what to expect from a book and from the MS tests and this book does almost NOTHING for you in regards to the exam.  Sure, it may be nice reading and it may have some interesting info, but if you are planning on buying a book to prepare for the 70-291 exam, SKIP this one.    I am going to reschedule my exam for a few weeks later and buy a REAL book! +books
An opportunity blown+N+Such a wonderful book has been brought down several notches by employing a reader that puts one to sleep.  My travels are made signifacantly more enjoyable by listening to books-on-CD while driving. I've tried several times to listen to the Civil War but had to give it up.  Mr. Whitener's voice is so drone and expressionless that I quickly loose interest.  Sorry to be so negative, but this CD is very disappointing. Stick to the book+books
Poor Binding+N+I too agree with them, I am a pchem student, and the binding on my book is coming off, I need to tape it in order to save it from falling off.  Yes, the derivation are hard to follow, my professor had to give hand outs on majority of them to show what steps were skipped. +books
The Real Deal+P+I have been a sci-fi/fantasy reader for over 30 years.  This book blew me away.  The characters were "fully fleshed out."  The plot, which would have come off as inane in less capable hands, resonates with, well, reality.  That's it!  Emma Bull got me to buy in to this story line - with all the "diversity" in the fey - and yes! it works.  I enjoyed it.  I loved the love story of Eddi and the phouka.  All in all, a great, fun read.  What more can you ask for+books
Lacks depth important to Flash 8+N+Gonzalez's "Flash Professional 8" underscores a deficiency common to many Flash instructional texts, where they spend half the book examining very basic subjects such as timeline-based animation and drawing tools. Granted, this book does a nice job illustrating some basics to flash, but the level of discourse here does not inspire conceptual creativity. Good books should lead to greater things, and not simply review the same basic subjects discussed since Flash 4. One reason why books like this exist is that Flash is poorly documented out of the box. Yet any decent used book on Flash MX will upstage this one.  While this book may lack instructional spirit, the most glaring omission is found in its Actionscript chapter. Ever since MX, the emphasis behind Flash has been the power and flexibility of Actionscript. Granted, Actionscript has become rather complicated, but a good author should at least prime the reader to the coding power available in Flash 8. Instead, we're treated to a weak smattering of script usage, without touching on the real power behind flash today: classes and object-oriented structure. As if that deficiency weren't glaring enough, the author provided examples of button coding that were outdated since Flash 5! There is no excuse for such weak writing. You the reader deserve a better challenge to expand and hone your Flash skills.  I'm giving this book special scrutiny because Lynda Weinman's textbooks have such visibility and apparent acclaim. While her books may be well marketed, they aren't always the best use of your money--or time spent reading. Let me suggest a few texts which I have read personally and can recommend. If you want a good beginner guide, check out Russell Chun's "Visual QuickPro" Flash books. More inspiring, project-related books are found under the Friends of Ed publishing line by Sham Bhangal. The most detailed and authoritative books I've read are Colin Moock's Definitive Guides, the other texts by O'Reilly, especially those which touch on OOP in detail. The last ones are tough at first, but they really open you up the power of Flash. And that in-depth Actionscript power is what your future employers will be looking for. Good luck.+books
Not a book for believers+N+This is not a book for believers.  Anyone of the Jewish, Christian or Muslim faith should not pick up this book because you will be seriously offended.  Mr. Kirsh takes several Biblical passages out of context to use  in his argument. His attitude towards anyone who believes is devoutly  religious and believes strongly in the words of the Bible is extreemly  condeceding.  He says &quot;If you read the Bible with open eyes and an  open mind&quot;.  Therefore presuposing anyone who does not see things his  way is narrow minded. It was not until I got trough the first 30 or so  pages did I realise that none of the &quot;rave reviews&quot; he received  were from any clergy or religious orders.  Further I realised that Mr.  Kirsch views are not stated out in the open.  You don't see his perjorative  view towards the Bible, Moses and God until AFTER you've got into reading  the book.  I would only recomend this book to aetheists and others who are  contemptuous of the Bible and the above faiths+books
Light and entertaining read+P+I bought this book after I became acquainted with Mitford sisters through a biography I have read.   After reading the biography, the first novel, "Pursuit of Love" seemed very familiar to me because in some parts it is almost a narration of the Mitford history. Some characters are given a different history but it is easy to recognize Jessica or Nancy herself.   I wouldn't go so far as to call these novels masterpieces but they are very witty and enjoyable. Especially if you are an Anglophile like me, you will most certainly enjoy this humorous depiction of upper class society in England.  Both novels are narrated by Fanny, cousin/friend to the heroines of the novels. "Pursuit of Love" is about Linda's love affairs and "Love in a Cold Climate" is about Polly's scandalous marriage. Both novels contain very enjoyable side characters like the bellowing Uncle Matthew, the health-conscious Uncle Davey and the lovable sissy Cedric Hampton. In fact the leading ladies are not explored so well as these characters. In the case of Polly we know very little about what goes in her mind.   I must also note that these novels are more about characters than plots. Nancy Mitford writes along about the characters and when there is nothing more to say, she abruptly ends the novels. Besides if you haven't read them one after the other, some of the points Fanny makes will be quite irrelevant as in the case of Fanny's meeting Fabrice in "Love in a Cold Climate" and mentioning that she will be adopting his son years later. First novel's heroine Linda is just a distant character in the second novel but the other, funnier characters appear in both novels.  All in all an enjoyable read but do not expect a literary masterpiece+books
Common sense amid chaos+P+I heard Dr. Wood speak in Washington before I purchased the book and he is as eloquent in person as he is on the page.  It is difficult to discuss this matter in the public square given the emotional sensitivities in our society when one tries to talk about race, and no doubt many on the left will dismiss Dr. Wood out of hand.  But he gives a reasoned, thoughtful discussion on an issue that is still very central in our lives and society - but as Dr. Wood points out, if the left weren't so focused on &quot;diversity&quot; we would likely be much closer to the colorblind society we all seek.  An excellent and timely read+books

Your coffee table needs this book.+P+Jean-Marie Potiez has produced a wonderful book.  The fantastic photos (many of which have not previously been published) are worth the price of the book alone. The photos must have been very carefully selected: they are all, unfailingly, flattering and the band never look less than achingly glamorous.  The informative and enjoyable commentary, pieced together from a mind-boggling number of interviews, is clearly a labour of love and there are many surprisingly revealing and poignant quotes.  Particularly sweet (and, ultimately, sad, given the couple's subsequent history) is Frida's statement that the best thing that ever happened to her was Benny, not ABBA.  The history of the ultimate pop group is traced on a year-by-year basis, from the mid 1960s, following the pre-ABBA careers of each member, through the romantic encounters, to the Eurovision win, to the will-we-ever-have-another-hit? tension, to (phew!) world domination.  Every step is lavishly illustrated with great photos.  ABBA's story reads like a film script -  humble beginnings, beautiful people in love, amazing talent, runaway success leading to a heartbreaking denoument.  There is even a 'where are they now?' epilogue.  This book wipes the floor with Potiez's video documentary of the band (&quot;Thank you ABBA&quot;). While it will certainly be a treasured luxury for ABBA's huge army of fans, this excellent book will also be of interest to anybody with an interest in perfect pop+books
The Crown Jewel of Japanese Literature+P+I first read Snow Country more than 20 years ago and it has haunted me ever since. Periodically I have to re-read it to see how age has affected my understanding. Like most of Kawabata's work Snow Country is a love story emphasizing, in restrained evocations, the evanescence of life and happiness.  Shimamura, the central character of Snow Country, is a Tokyo dilittante who breaks his ennui through his liaison with Komako, a geisha and denizen of the hill country near Niigata.  But his search for relief from his moral tedium succombs to his inability to have anything but aesthetic appreciation; he senses but he does not seem to feel.  It is Komako's hopelessness amidst her instinctive love for Shimamura that makes this story so compelling.  Shimamura's ironic detachment from life, evident in his wholly aesthetic perspectives on everything ranging from Western ballet (something of which though he has never viewed he has exhaustive knowledge) to pastoral vistas and the methodical attentions of a hotspring geisha, prevents him from feeling the love Komako throws at him.  Komako herself is confined to what the Japanese call the mizushobai, or the "floating existence." This "water-like" life of women who earn their living through paid companionship in bars and resorts gives them a certain degree of freedom but can also resign them to loneliness and most often does.  While Shimamura is attracted to Komako, her status combined with his aesthetic perspective of her as a woman of the mizushobai dooms the affair as he takes to admiring a younger geisha called Yoko.    It took Kawabata nearly 13 years to craft this story into its final form. That long attention to writing the novel pays huge dividends. Snow Country is certainly one of the masterpieces of Japanese literature, and it is the story that won Yasunari Kawabata the Nobel Prize+books

The Book of Junk+N+"The Book of J" is an attempted restoration and critique of the original source document of the Pentateuch. Bloom first introduces the proposed author of this book - an original and provocative ironist, a lady of Solomon's court, who has been totally misunderstood. The next section is a translation of the reconstructed book of J by Rosenberg, who has also authored a brief appendix about the translation. The following two sections include Bloom's commentary on the book of J, its narrative, personalities and themes. This is the silliest book on the Hebrew Bible that I have ever read. It is obnoxious, almost totally unsubstantiated, and replete with simple misunderstandings of the Hebrew text. Bloom's somewhat euphemistic admissions that he is neither a historian (12) nor a biblical scholar (41) are the only parts of the book that I agree with. He mocks religious Jews, Christians, the "abominable Jeremiah" (176) and, with particular frequency, J's God. To the unprejudiced reader the God of the Hebrew Bible is majestic, awesome, and holy throughout, nothing like what Bloom describes. The arrogant claim that the Hebrew Bible or its proposed substrate has been misunderstood for millennia by people devoted to it needs much stronger support than the speculation that Bloom provides. Among other things, we learn that God sits in the terebrinths of Mamre eating curds (12, 258) (a total misreading of Genesis 18), that God loves David but not Moses (41) (contrary to Exodus 33:11-12 and Numbers 12:7), that Moses becomes the founder of circumcision (245) (contrary to Genesis 17), and that God doesn't punish Moses for good reason (34), without much explanation. However, we are told that traditional Jewish and Christian expositors are "weak readers" (34) and "mad" (246). Virtually no secondary sources are offered for the assertions made in this book, though we hear occasionally about Noth, von Rad and Van Seters, among a few others. To his credit, Bloom mentions the opening words of Cassuto's commentary on Genesis (20), but fails to engage at all with Cassuto's stunning rebuttal of the documentary hypothesis. I recommend Cassuto's "The Documentary Hypothesis" as the perfect antidote to "The Book of J". Not a shred of archaeological evidence is offered in support of Bloom's assertions. Other literature of the ancient Near East receives no treatment. The content of the Pentateuch places its composition firmly in the late second millennium BCE, and its style and structure parallels other ancient texts of the Near East of that time - until it is mutilated and divided into its putative sources. For the relevance of this evidence to the dating and composition of the Hebrew Bible generally, I recommend Kitchen's monumental "On the Reliability of the Old Testament". Bloom and Rosenberg's transliteration is very inconsistent, and we're even treated to the non-existent form "v'yhi" (329). Rosenberg translates from standard editions of the masoretic text; but I think that for a task like his a critical edition would have been better. Readers looking for an introduction to theories about the composition of the Hebrew Bible should look elsewhere. In my opinion, the documentary hypothesis is speculative, unsubstantiated and discredited by archaeological evidence, and the hypotheses of this book add assertion to assertion, and speculation to speculation. I do not recommend it+books
New edition spares the frustration!+N+Boyd's revised edition of Virgil's Aeneid is the essential book to prepare for the AP Latin: Virgil exam or just become familiar with this favorite of all Classicists.  With all the lines on the AP syllabus and no more, Boyd's Aeneid effectively prepares students to be familiar with all the lines that may appear on the test.  Each page has a paragraph of Latin text, with numerous footnotes underneath, offering translation help through grammar and vocabulary hints.  A glossary in back serves as quick reference to unfamiliar words.  While Clyde Pharr's edition has similar detail in footnotes and vocabulary, the Pharr text contains ALL of books 1-9 only, meaning that students have to take home a heavier textbook and also purchase a separate text for books 10-12 of the Aeneid.  Thus, Boyd spares students from searching for the passages that will actually be covered: it contains only what is on the syllabus.  It is a great way to study Virgil's classic epic+books

Pointless+N+The illustrations in this book, an artful combination of digital realistic media and traditional pen and ink are brought together in splashes of color and images that delight the imagination.  However, fantastic illustrations alone can not make up for a story line that lacks creativity and warmth.         An almost robotic tone takes the reader through a day in the life of our mischievous protagonist whose actions, such as "showing Joey Whipple my underpants" and setting shoes on fire using the sun and a magnifying glass go a step beyond acceptable childish pranks.  The story ends abruptly without closure and without endearing the characters which leaves the reader wondering "what is the point?"   +books
Six short stories (3 by each author)+P+On the whole, I was drawn into RM's stories more quickly than PD's (my favourites are "The Sea King's Son" and "The Water Horse"), although after repeated exposure I've developed some liking for two of his three. McKinley's stories herein seem to me to have more detailed and polished world-building. None of the six, to my knowledge, have been published previously.  "Mermaid Song" (PD) Setting = very like Puritan New England. (I'd have enjoyed it more if PD had simply made it an alternate Puritan history.) While the mundane setting may be off-putting at first, the sea-people's introduction is well handled when it comes. In a way, this is two stories - a family tradition (handed down from mother to daughter) and the story of the protagonist, young Pitiable Nasmith, left with her maternal grandparents upon her mother's death in childbirth.  Near the end of her life, Pitiable's grandmother tells her the story behind the most unusual of her songs - how their ancestress Charity Goodrich really survived shipwreck upon arriving in the new world as a girl. Although the People's culture isn't fleshed out much, the first contact scene between Charity and her sea-children rescuers is realistically detailed. In a neat reversal of some sea-people stories, the air-breathing person was a pet, kept in an undersea cave with no way out.  The present-day story turns grim when the grandfather takes to drink after his wife's death, which seems to have quenched what little of his heart survived his daughter's passing. Eventually he takes to walking along the seashore, and finds something that only Pitiable has learned to recognize, shaping up to a possible reversal of the secret tradition.  "The Sea-King's Son" (RM) Jenny, only child of a well-off farming family, grew into shyness as she grew up, and never let on that she had fallen in love with Robert, a good-looking younger son of another farming family from a village on the far side of the harbour separating the small towns they live in - a harbour under a curse by the king of the sea people, to avenge an injustice inflicted by the land people in the days when the two races had dealings with one another (though only a trade in luxury items, never friendship, each race considering the other too alien to grow close to). But when Jenny's parents make plans to send her away to the city for a season, in the hope that she might shake off her shyness, and perhaps find a good husband, Robert finally makes a move - for love of Jenny's inheritance rather than for her. But late in their courtship, Jenny makes an unannounced visit alone to Robert's family home, and what she learns there is more terrible for her than any ancient tale of sea-curses, and drives her onto the shortest road home - the direct route across the harbour.  "Sea Serpent" (PD) I was disappointed with the initial scene-setting, although the wave-riders eventually won me over a bit. The conflict between the New religion's chief god and the Old's chief goddess comes to a head as the builder of a new temple seeks building stone taken from the goddess' shrine (which seemed unoriginal). The magic-working temple-builder forces the neutral wave-riders, worshippers of the Sea God, to help transport the stones. The details of the minutiae, practical politics, and ethics of the wave-riders' work make the latter portion of the story a decent read.  "Water Horse" (RM) "This island is a strange place...a threshold between land and water; and the boundary between us is striven for, and fought over, and it shifts sometimes this way, and sometimes that...it is over this one island that the war is fought, and if once we yielded, then all those lands behind us - farther from the boundary we protect - would immediately come under threat, and they have no Guardians. We are the Guardians; and here we hold the line." So says Western Mouth to her inland-born apprentice, Tamia, who began her training at fourteen as do all apprentices, and can't help worrying that she's not really suitable for the work. But Western Mouth was a very old woman by the time Tamia came along...When Western Mouth has a stroke five years into Tamia's apprenticeship, the defenses are torn open, allowing a creature of sea-magic to slip through that Tamia must face in her Guardian's stead.  "Kraken" (PD) Somewhat similar to "Mermaid Song", although the two humans swept into the water are saved by more supernatural means and for more complex reasons. The protagonist, a young sea-princess indulging in her last rule-breaking before coming of age, runs serious risks to try to return them to the upper air.  "A Pool in the Desert" (RM) The only Damar story herein - not surprising, for a country bordered by desert in the more recent ages of the world. The protagonist, a present-day Homelander (not unlike our own present), begins dreaming of a time so far in Damar's past that it has become legend, and finds it far more like home than her parents' household, with their stranglehold on their children.+books
An easy to read useful book and not only for Business+P+I always thought I was good at communication until I read this book (text book really). I was particularly impressed by the examples of emails that on the surface look fine until the writer points out the loop holes.

I have also used my newly acquired skills in academic, political and philanthropic forums and received very positive feedback from colleagues who noticed a change. Buy this book+books
Good coverage of many issues+P+I had heard Wolfe described as America's premier social critic before I  read this book.  I did not come away disappointed as Wolfe tackled many  issues in modern life from a proper critical perspective, ignoring ideology  in favor of reason.  He finds the flaws in both left and right, feminism  and laissez-faire capitalism.  Written at a level where the average reader  can understand, unlike many scholarly works, this book still offers  in-depth analysis.  Wolfe is certainly one of the more impressive authors  I've read lately+books
Shallow ideas & deep misunderstandings+N+Robert Laughlin is a great physicist who has found some truly important insights about condensed matter physics in general and the fractional quantum Hall effect in particular, and he deserves his 1998 physics Nobel prize.  But his attempts to say something profound about fundamental physics and particle physics seem far less serious. Be sure that my opinion is shared not only by a huge majority of "fundamental physicists" but even by many colleagues of Laughlin in condensed matter physics. The main problem with his reasoning is that he has obviously no solutions for the problems he tries to address.   All of us agree that some important features of physical phenomena do not depend on the details of underlying physics; many of these phenomena are emergent in character; it is not too important or useful to know quarks or strings in order to study most of the important concepts in biology, climate, physics of water, or quantum computing. If Laughlin thinks that other physicists do not realize this fact, then he is fighting a strawman. Most physicists realize these things - and many fundamental physicists actually use very similar mathematical techniques as Laughlin does in his "emergent" approach.  But at the same moment, there are contexts - and particle physics and/or fundamental physics is a textbook example - where we simply do need to ask different questions. We need to know what natural laws underlie the phenomena we observe at longer distances. We need to find more fundamental, more elementary, and usually smaller constituents of the matter and the interactions that control their dynamics.   We need to study these questions whenever we want to determine physics more accurately; we also need to study these questions because we want to acquire a deeper knowledge that is necessary for future constructions of emergent theories; we need to investigate the underlying physics in order to illuminate some features and parameters of the effective theories that the effective theories themselves simply don't explain and can't explain. People have been looking for more fundamental theories of the real world for quite some time, they have made a tremendous progress in this reductionist quest, and the reductionist approach is responsible for many of the achievements of the modern era. If there were no reductionists in the 19th and 20th centuries, electrons would not have been discovered and Laughlin could probably never construct the wavefunction for which he was awarded by the Swedish Academy of Sciences.  Laughlin seems to misunderstand these points. He thinks that his dislike for particle physics is a valuable idea by itself. It's not. He has nothing to say about these issues, and therefore silence would be better for him and for everyone else. The same conclusion holds for Laughlin's opinions about the black holes and other issues in the realm of fundamental physics.   Laughlin seems to believe that the condensed matter physics way of thinking is very rare among particle physicists, string theorists, and general relativists, and therefore it is very important for him to present conjectures that the black holes are made of plastic or something very similar. But such conjectures are not too useful because fundamental physics simply does not work in this way. If physics of polymers were important for the research of black holes, it is very likely that the black hole physicists would be forced to figure out how to apply these rules even without the help of Prof. Laughlin.  The book uses many metaphors from the everyday life. The author usually offers ten sentences even though his simple and shallow idea is completely clear already from the sentence number one. Several chapters at the end of the book are redundant as wholes.  You don't need to read this book. The main ideas can be summarized as follows: Prof. Laughlin believes that we should always be satisfied with a superficial description of physical phenomena and we should never try to look "inside" in order to identify more elementary components. Prof. Laughlin is wrong, he has nothing to say about the important questions that Laughlin believes are unimportant, he actually says nothing about most of the important questions in the reductionist vs. emergent debate, and you better save your money and time+books
No new information+N+This book offers nothing to someone remotely familiar with environmental issues.

It will definitely join my list of favorites+books
when talk is not cheap+N+The criticism that a lot of the perfume and aromatherapy community has leveled at this book has been that there is nothing in this book that is not already in print.  I'd be willing to agree with that.  Considering that Chrissie Wildwood is out of print, and that Arctander and Tisserand are hard to find inexpensively, this book is an okay stand-in for those which preceded it.  It is not the final authority however, despite the glowing reviews.  Get the original works from these three authors if you possibly can, if you consider yourself a perfumery scholar+books

A balanced, loving history of devotion to Mary+P+As a convert from Protestantism, I have struggled with the place of the Blessed Virgin Mary in my personal spirituality as well as my defense of the Faith. Father McBride's Images of Mary has been a turning point for me.  He has treated the reader as a thinking adult and as a pilgrim. His  synthesis of personal devotion with the writings of the Church Fathers,  Church Councils, and contemporary writers has resolved many objective and  subjective dilemmas for me. I have given the book to many friends. My wife  and teenage children are studying it with me. I am particularly thankful  for his tender use of iconography as way of catechizing from the heart+books

an excellent introduction to Henry James and his style+P+&quot;The Aspern papers&quot; is a surprisingly short, sexy and suspenseful novel. It will completely change your opinion of Henry James; he shows himself to be an master of suspense and well played out drama instead of the ambiguous pussyfooting plodder that most people think him to be. There is a definite touch of evil in this novella. It takes place in a stuffy interior world dominated by an old sinister woman in a green shade. The narrator's intentions are quite amoral and evil. The narration is deftly created through sure touches of insecurity and self pity. The trick of the unreliable narrator is used to great effect. And at no point does it seem anything other than a seamless and effective method of narration+books
Obviously a rush job!+N+The book is useful, but I had to keep putting it down out of frustration.  Many of the examples and images don't match up with the text, it's loaded with typos, and chapter 7 constantly references itself as chapter 6.  That's as far as I've gotten so far, because I *really* have to keep putting this book down out of frustration.  Let me be clear, I'm not super-picky about typos and what not, but this book is ridiculous.  A few hours of proof-reading is all that would have been needed.  I'm honestly amazed it was released like this.  Somebody needs to get fired over this.  It's that bad.  And no, I'm not exaggerating.  As far as how useful the book is, you can pick it up and leaf through to find a solution to whatever problem you're trying to solve.  But if the solution you find is affected by one of the hundred or so typos and mistakes, you might be setting yourself up for a wild goose chase trying to figure out why your code doesn't work like it does in the book.  Ask me how I know..  Also, note that most of the positive reviews here refer to the 1st edition+books
Not Exactly What I Expected+N+I read this book because I really enjoyed Southgate's The Fall of Rome. Third Girl from the Left; however, is no Fall of Rome. Southgate attempts to create a link between three generations of women from the same family by imbuing each of them with a love film. Despite her valiant attempt, the stories just don't come together well. Yes, each of the characters finds escape/ solace at the movies, but in spite of this common link, as well as the link of emotional distance between mothers/daughters, and artistic aspirations, there are too many distractions in the book to make it work well. Southgate tries to cram too much into one book- a cursory look at the infamous Tulsa race riots; an exploration of Black women and lesbianism/sexuality; familial estrangement; and the history of the Blaxploitation movement in film. An entire novel could be written about any one of these topics, but to shove them altogether in one novel, gives short shrift to them all.+books
Unimaginative patterns; assumes reader knows nothing about knitting+N+This is one of the most disappointing knitting books I've ever purchased.  I expected patterns that would highlight the beauty of ribbon yarns but all I got were a  bunch of basic patterns for purses, halter tops, square cushions, etc.  Author assumes that her reader does not know how to knit; at least a quarter of the pages in the book are how-tos that apply to any kind of yarn+books
Simple, clear and relevant presentation of the subject!+P+I read this book with enthusiasm and a new understanding of many of the integral Buddhist concepts - even after having practiced Buddhism for many years. The author brings some difficult and confusing Buddhist tenets home and applies them to modern day examples which are easy to understand and grasp. My husband, a non-Buddhist, found the book quite lucid, persuasive and enlghtening. Anyone who is interested in an "update" and modern day application of this precious ancient philosophy will delight in and learn much from this book!+books
Excellent addition to Eclips-o-phile's bookshelf+P+Even if you have other eclipse books at home, TOTALITY provides fresh information about this fascinating phenomenon.  This book describes in clear language what makes a total solar eclipse so special.  The authors explanation of the science behind eclipses helps to demystify the eclipse, while the chapter devoted to impressions from a group of dedicated eclipse chasers, gives a sense of the magic of a total solar eclipse.  There are plenty of drawings and photographs complement the writing, with an excellent set of references in the appendix.  Highly recommended, Jerry Levy ...+books
Great Yarn, Great Look at the Twenties+P+Everyone knows the expression, "Ponzi Scheme", but I doubt many knew the derivation.  Mr. Zuckoff lays out its derivation in this terrifically readable book.  The real Mr. Ponzi immigrated from Italy, moved around, being arrested in Montreal and Mississppi, before settling down in Boston where he started a "Rob Peter to pay Paul" scheme which now uses his name.  Ponzi offered 50% return on investment in a mere 45 days in 1920.  Mr. Zuckoff points out how the American psyche was so ripe at the time for such get rich schemes.  Ponzi took advantage of that mindset and in a brief period - just a matter of months - compiled a fortune.  It is truly unclear from the letters, quotes and litany of acts by Ponzi whether he ever believed he could repay all his investors or was knowingly just trying stay ahead - one step before the law and one step in front of running out of money to pay investors.  Certainly he could have fled back to Italy at any time before getting caught, but he never did.  Until the authorities caught up with him he was able to continue paying his high ball interest.  Mr. Zuckoff's portrayal of the con artist shows him to be so charismatic and colorful that the reader gets swept up into him just as his many Boston supporters did during the Ponzi-mania.  You almost have to root for the little guy.  Mr. Zuckoff also portrays the antagonists - whoops - the journalists and authorities that catch up to Ponzi very well.  The editor of the Boston Post is another rags to riches hero of the book.  Although this is, for the most part, the history of Ponzi and scheme, the author paints a complete picture of the times in which he was able to perpetrate his scheme/crime.  This is what makes this book a more comprehensive history than just the telling of the scheme and how it was uncovered.    To make the book even more entertaining, it is written almost like a novel, with each page revealing a bit more of the story.  This very readable book is highly recommended.  +books
Le Carre's laurels don't rescue this book+N+A wasted effort from one on the most perceptive minds alive. He dropped his past standards on this book.  Only the gems of wisdom about human nature gives it value.  An unknown author would have had this book rejected, or at least criticized.  I agree with the following observations taken from other reviewers:  "The story was all over the place and the ending far from satisfying."  "The first hundred or so pages move at a glacial pace, and the author's disjointed manner of storytelling soon becomes confusing and annoying."  "Far too much of the book took place in flashback... vacillating from vague self-pity to vague longing to vague regret and back... Of the three pivotal characters, two are presented almost entirely in flashback."  "Too dense and slow moving... even though the language is always wondrous."  "...novel seems dark and pointless."  "numbing dive into the depths of one man's self-absorption left me gasping for air."  If you are new to Le Carre, read his earlier works first or you may never read them after this work+books
I love books and this one is just bad...+N+Boring, outdated ex-patriate story of life in Paris between the wars, focusing on a young American actress, a psychologist Dr. Diver and his wife, an American baroness with issues.  Lots of drinking and gossip+books
How to Clean the Air and Reduce Energy Costs+P+Peter Asmus is a sensitive, and involved, observer of the 20-year struggle to make wind energy a valuable energy resource.  This book describes the soaring victories and crashing defeats, with the personalities of the people adding more than enough color and life.  Here are the words of one wind industry promoter who made the transition from dreamer to bank-financed developer without losing his pony-tail: &quot;Kudos, and more kudos. You cut through all of our industry's    bulls--t with wit and candor, and injected living, breathing humanity into a story of technology. Injecting your own personality, as well. Despite the obvious that no one can ever tell the true story as it happened, you have done a remarkable job in bringing the wind industry's evolution to life, and the future of American, no, global, society, rests in your    readers' understanding of the lessons from your brilliant history of our industry.&quot; Wind energy is now harnessed with modern machines in 23 states of the US. As we teeter on the edge of another energy crisis, this books describes what some people are doing about to improve the health and security of all people.  The beauty of this book is its invitation for everyone to choose the direction for the future+books
Few options when it comes to this subject+N+This is a fantastic study in the psychology of the mind of a megamaniacal dilettant who, like many of them, believe they are participants in, not just the scribes of, history. Witness lines from Goltz's book like "It was my own little gesture at stopping World War III".  As a study of this under-reported conflict, unfortunately it's just about the only way to get any information at all in English, hence the two stars. And Goltz is not only up front about his pro-Turkic bias (his wife is Turkish), he is honest about the failings of the Azerbaijani government's policies, and reasons for loss of this war. There are a lot of facts here, in spite of what the more vituperative reviewers claim on this page.  The problem with the book is Goltz's unbearable self-importance and flat tone of voice. Goltz published an earlier book called "Requiem for a Would-be Republic" from which most of this book is extracted. "Requiem" has a very rushed (and amateurish)feel and "AZ Diary" didn't even bother to correct that. Maybe Mr. Goltz has read a little too much Hunter S. Thompson? Or maybe he's rushing to meet some deadline? If Mr. Goltz is reading this, I would recommend he read Michael Herr's "Dispatches" before writing another book.  Mr. Goltz also, the reader will notice, behaves like he knows the history of the region, when clearly he doesn't know anything but what he was told on the ground.  If you can overlook pretentiousness, absence of historical context and flatness of tone, there is some value in this book. If only a better and more imaginative writer had Goltz's courage to be in Azerbaijan at the time of the conflict.   I agree with other reviewers that Mr. Goltz is probably not a paid propagandist. There is no evidence of this; To me he comes off as just a sucker who got taken in by a cause not rightly his, and who wants, for personal reasons, to be the champion of a people he sees, rightly or wrongly, as victims of injustice+books
Sauces +P+This is a well written book with execllent photography, but not what one would consider buying to learn how to make the basic and newer sauces.   It's actually just another great cook book+books
Too much info +N+This is just way to much for a toddler.  When they have a question it can come in handy as a referance for the parent. By the time they are old enough to ask these questions they have conquered potty training. I read to my son potty books while he is on the potty and this one is quite boring, he doesnt have a clue what Im talking about+books
Not an easy read, but worth it+P+This novel was difficult for me to get into.  The noir speak of the book presented itself as a barrier to entry.  After training myself to think in terms of the language, I found myself so engrossed in the story that I moved through it at a steady pace.  Definitely a darker novel but the character development was outstanding+books
We need to find some better heroes.+N+Andy Milligan was a terrible filmmaker, and his snail-paced movies, which blended trash and pompous period costumes, can only be called unwatchable. His final film, Monstrosity, was truly the work of an incoherent brain, blending rape, hypodermic needles, and a grinning slapstick monster wearing a Fred Flintstone suit. McDonough's book is fascinating at first, but then one realizes that these aren't artists being described with such misguided affection. Like Warhol's crowd, Milligan's world was populated by uneducated drug addicts, and people obsessed with their own fractured sexuality. One of these days, there'll be a book about a true underground filmmaker, but in the meantime, we're stuck with the sniveling praise of sycophants like John Waters, and books like this which glorify the excretions of talentless slobs+books
Pontification At Its Most Verbose+N+The 30 second spot is dead.  The 30 second spot is dead!  THE 30 SECOND SPOT IS DEAD!  Alright, I get it already.  At least I did after the first 60 pages or so.  Unfortunately this book does not end at 60 pages.  Never have so many words been used to say so little.  The first third of this book (plus one chapter online) (parenthesis meant as a tribute to Jaffe) tells you why the 30 second spot is dead.  To illustrate the demise of the 30 second spot, Jaffe uses a dead horse and beats it repeatedly.  Perhaps Jaffe is quite funny and clever at a party, but his schtick gets a little old when trudging through 276 pages of his quips (plus one chapter online).  Jaffe fashions himself as a modern day Don Rickles, passing out insults to everything and everybody who uses a 30 second spot.  Unfortunately, this increases the page count of the book by about 90 pages.  The final two-thirds of the book is a survey of everything you can use instead of the 30 second spot.  Jaffe says you have 10 options and he has designed 10 little logos for each of them (which you can see on his website) (again parenthesis meant as a salute to Jaffe).  This is not any ground breaking information.  If you have been paying attention and made occasional contact with society, you will have realized that you can use the internet as a marketing tool.  Mostly, Jaffe's observations are re-hashes of stuff you can find in a trade journal or two.  And because this is an ADWEEK Book, I suspect most of this stuff was available in an ADWEEK article.  The important thing about this survey portion of the book is that it gives you very little insight on how to use these tools more effectively.  It's just Jaffe telling you that you are ignorant if you are not using his 10 alternatives to the 30 second spot.  Save yourself $20 and get a subscription to Adweek instead+books
Dislikes new translation+N+Although the author does a very good job putting the text of the plays into the modern English vernacular, I feel as though the works have had their flavor removed.  If you are a purist, like I am, stick to the "old" translation.+books
Slapped together - Dry and Boring+N+The previous post says nothing about the quality of this book and thus should be considered a definition of the XAML technology rather than a review.  In my opinion this book seemed slapped together. It was as if the tech writer of the documentation paraphrased the MS XAML Help. There was very little usage of metaphor or humour to make the topic interesting or easier to understand.   The code examples are extremely simple and unimaginative. In one of the very few lame attempts at humour the author comments about an animated rotating square and states that, "It may not be very useful, but it sure is fun to watch." I found this attempt at humour insulting. Can you imagine having a conversation with someone who talked like this?  If you are like me and you really like to have a paper version of bleeding edge tech stuff, you can be can be forgiven for purchasing this drivel. If you want to save yourself some hard earned cash, just download the MS Expression Interactive Designer CTP and work through the examples. You will learn more doing this in less time. In fact, unless you are stuck on the bus, you are wasting your time with this book.+books

This book really is definitive and realistic+P+I have programmed in Applescript for many years, but this book really helped to clarify a number of issues.  This is no starry-eyed, AppleScript-can-do-anything fluff job, but a down-to-earth comprehensive description of a powerful, sometimes quirky, tool that will make your Mac even more useful, if you are willing to invest some time to learn.  I highly recommend this book for anyone thinking of using AppleScript, or anyone already using it+books
Wonderful!+P+This book is a wonderful resource to use with children of any age.  I  recently read this book to my 2nd graders and they loved it.

Better than Roark's Formulas for stress &amp; strain.+N+This book has a lot of information most of which is useless calculus integration with vary brief summery which seems to me being derived from other books just thrown into the mix with general categories. The book is basically an oversized machinery's handbook but with a poorly written index and with a lot of inapt formulas that don't have a explanation for formula variables used in the equation.  If you do a lot of strength of material design I would suggest a machinery's hand book, or the McGraw Hill Mechanical Engineering Design book which is an excellent P.E. exam reference book. Stay away from the Roarks Formulas for stress &amp; strain book its more poorly written then the Marks+books
politics of race+N+This book fascinates me because it was challenged by the NAACP in 1945 for its quiet exclusionary racism+books
Good but not complete+P+I just finished the Historical Atlas and while the book does a great job of touching on so many subjects in such a small space, it leaves a little to be desired because it does not focus on any one point in the city's development enough.  I would have enjoyed the book more if it had a little more detail on how landmarks came to be where they are, and what the political an social culture of the city was at different time points that influenced the way the city developed.  I suppose that wasn't the book's intent, though.  Also, it would be nice to get a follow up chapter on the city's continued development since 1994.  Overall, I thought the book was a good intro to NYC history, but I think I'm going to try a more in-depth history to fill in some gaps+books
A return to roots+P+As good as it was when first published...even more meaningful after 30 years. As valid now as it was then+books
A Disappointing Read+N+This book had the potential to be very good but in the end, it is quite average.  The author's worst enemy is himself.  For some unknown reason, Reidy feels the need to make some sort of joke or wisecrack once every six sentences.  This interrupts the flow of the story and, most importantly, the jokes quit being funny around Page 12.  And on top of that, the constant attempts at humor create a sense that the author is lying about many things.    I am not sure why Reidy felt the need to constantly make jokes (self-deprecating and otherwise) but it absolutely ruined the entire story.  After a while, you will begin to think he is making up half the stories he tells.  In all, a very disappointing read.  +books

A hard, laborious read+N+Like many people, I bought this book to distinguish between a very entertaining movie, Amadeus, and the truth. I am a musician and am very interested in truly talented and practiced musicians wether they be current or of historically mythic proportions. The effort and research in this book is excellent but, unfortunately, it is full of psychology and psychoanalysis which I'm not particularly interested in. It may be more interesting if it was proven data but these analyses are little more than guesses by a writer. How do you get deep, deep into the head of someone from well over two centuries ago? I'm sure some of Solomon's conclusions are valid but I kept finding myself looking to see how much more of the book I had left to go so I could say I finished it and get onto something much more pleasurable+books
Hall of Fame+P+This book is a gem.  It centers on two acts of betrayal, one large, one not--yet, the small act of unkindness has remained with its perpetrator all his life.  Wisdom seeps out of the pores of this novel.  And I must add that it's heartbreaking to read reviews like the one below by "JMack" who believes that the book "does not deliver"--heartbreaking to think of how many other sublime works of literature he hasn't gotten.  Sad.  In any case, do yourself a great favor and read Maxwell [who was, all his adult life, a fiction editor at The New Yorker]. After this one you can read, TIME WILL DARKEN IT and the volume of collected stories published near the end of his long life.     +books
A teaching tool for counting from 1-15, 20,30,40...100.+P+I liked this book for various reasons.  First, I thought it was neat for representing numbers through numerals, words, and dots.  It also  incorporated street scenes and common objects for the reader to see a  certain number of objects in an everyday situation.  I also liked how the  cover and some pictures showed children of different races together.  The  only thing negative comment I have is that the pictures are black and white  and not as attractive as more current books.  I think the book is  appropriate and a great way to practice counting+books

Book for all to read+P+Avorn's beautifully written book seems to become more important for "the rest of us" with every breaking news story about the pharmecutical industry. My suggestion in the light of the Vioxx disaster? If you are interested in your own health and the medicines we take so casually, then buy a copy of this beautifully written and oh so revealing book.   Let me give you a flavor of just how good a writer Avorn he and how revealing this book is by quoting the way he introduces a chapter from this book:      "In a former British colony, most healers believed the conventional wisdom that a distillation of fluids extracted from the urine of horses, if dried to a powder and fed to aging women, could act as a general tonic, preserve youth, and ward off a variety of diseases. The preparation became enormously popular throughout the culture, and was used widely by older women in all strata of society. Many years later modern scientific studies revealed that long-term ingestion of the horse-urine extract was useless for most of its intended purposes, and that it caused tumors, blood clots, heart disease, and perhaps brain damage."  This (sad) "fairy tale" introduces the whole sorry tale of hormone replacement therapy for women, and how badly the research was to defend it. The book just gets better from here+books

NO INFORMATION FOR BLACK WOMEN, RACIST+N+This book is not for people of color.  Paula Begoun only devotes 10 pages to information regarding black hair, and actually has the audicity to say, "Suffice it to say that the natural state of black hair is currently not an acceptable fashion statement for women of color."  IS SHE CRAZY??? This statement is extremely offensive. (Would anyone ever say almond shaped eyes are unacceptable on asian people?)  This is a part of our genetics and our looks. Does Paula notice all of the models, actresses, singers and even politicians who are black (women) who wear their hair natural???  Even white people and asian people try to braid/lock their hair to look like ours!!  If she thinks natural black hair is unacceptable, then she should not write books abour hair care, and go live by herself on an island (which is obviously where she has been).  Paula sweetie, stop sniffing hair care products..+books
Harmful, Hobbling "Hysteria's Herstory" +N+I'm giving this book two stars instead of three because the author felt compelled to waste so much white space on her leftwing, feminist agenda.  Ms. Harwood has published several articles on the supposed sexism of Latin textbooks, and so litters her book with largely pointless textboxes containing "gender-specific historical tidbits" which she calls "Hysteria's Herstory." (Something tells me that doesn't have quite the alliterative ring the author intended.)    Likewise, what Ms. Harwood refers to as "the Christian Church" of the so-called Dark Ages is in reality the Catholic Church.  Presumably, the correct identifier didn't sit well with her progressive sensibilities.  For an agenda-free discourse on Latin, get the Dummies book or stick with Wheelock's Latin 6e+books
best short, complete book on ancient Greece+P+If you don't know much about ancient Greek history or culture, this is the best short book I know of. On every page, in every sentence, the author gets straight to the point, with no fancy obfuscations, assuming no prior knowledge. I've never seen a better organized history of ancient Greece. Besides that, I strongly approve of the map selection and the timelines. He gives just enough depth to be a solid introduction--just a little bit more than "what you're supposed to know."   Some teachers I know prefer a book titled "Ancient Greece" written by a team of authors led by Sarah Pomeroy. It has just a bit more depth than this book, but it isn't nearly as well written. It seems that they wanted it to be easily comprehensible, but I'm not sure they succeeded. It does have the advantage of a little more depth, but if you're reading for pleasure, I recommend this one rather than that one.  It is, though, only an introduction; that's the obvious downside of being short. You might want more information about the culture: more excerpts from the poets, the thoughts of the philosophers described in more detail, more plates (or plates in color) about the art. Actually the book is amply illustrated in black and white. But of course a book dedicated to Greek culture would have better information on any of these aspects, and that would be a book worth reading. This one serves only as an introduction. I strongly recommend reading the Norton Critical Editions of the Iliad and Odyssey, Hesiod, a couple famous tragedies (in my opinion, Euripides' Medea is the one to read first), and a few of Plato's more famous dialogues. THAT is an introduction; but if that's the kind of thing you intend to do, this book will be a great place to start.  On the historical/political/social matters, this book is again a great introduction, but only an introduction. If you want more detailed information, especially a look at the reasons historians believe such and such happened, I very strongly recommend John V. A. Fine's "The Ancient Greeks," one of the very best history books I've ever read. Of course it's a lot longer, but it's worth it. Once again, if you're reading for pleasure, I recommend this one first, and then Fine's book, which is a bit harder to follow.  If you want to read about Greek religion, I would once again start here; but then you should read the classic, Walter Burkert's book, and follow it up with Jan Bremmer's book, both titled "Greek Religion."  Of course, why not a little cheerleading for learning about ancient Greece? Since the Renaissance and even more since the Victorian era, anyone in the West who would call themselves educated has had to have basic knowledge of ancient Greece. They were certainly very influential on Western culture, and via Bactria even had some considerable influence on East Asia.   I've found that Greek history somehow arouses more curiousity in students than modern European or American history. I think it's because of the nature of the ancient Greeks themselves, because they reflected on human nature via their own history, so as we study ancient Greece, we get to reflect on the nature of power, why governments take forms such as aristocracies or democracies or monarchies, why wars are won or lost, why empires rise and fall, how much blood and misery flow through history, and so on. Students don't merely have to memorize lists of events and prepared ideas, but they get to reflect about life, why the world is the way it is, for themselves. And that is what most people, young or old, are all about.+books
Tripoli and early American foreign policy+P+This book was my first exposure to the Barbary Pirates and that era of American foreign policy. It is a terrifically interesting period of American history. America,the young nation dealing with foreign policy issues in North Africa where local Muslim powers are capturing ships and demanding ransom. The Bashaw of Tripoli and his history with the politics of that region in the early 1800s is rendered more relevant given current events. It is a truly human read with the strengths and weaknesses of those portrayed exposed. This is not sugar coated American history, be advised. +books
Stashed-away candy+P+The chapter titled "Aloha" is central to Waimea Williams' book, both in its position and its importance. In it, she discusses what this word means to her, and to others.  She says, "To lack aloha in even a small way meant being selfish, which was deeply embarrassing, and children accused of selfishness would correct this at once by giving stashed-away candy to a brother, or doing someone else's chores without grumbling." For me, the most remarkable and beautiful aspect of this book is how it is, itself, a perfect example of "aloha." It's a memoir, certainly, and much that the author shares is distinctly personal, but her stories are starting points and illustrations - the book immediately expands beyond her own experiences to include many voices. Missionaries, journalists, ancient rulers and taro farmers are all heard from. So is the Honolulu phone book. Every specific recollection opens up to broader thinking: the glamorous Rita Hayworth pays a visit to the Coco Palms Lodge, or is it the goddess Pele incarnate? This fits right into a discussion of the ancient ways, always right beside you in this place, and delivers us naturally to ideas about the contemporary globalization of traditional Hawaiian religion. The book is about life in the 1950's but it encompasses what came before, and provides a way to understand what came after. For a memoir, this is a very unselfish book. The author has shared her stashed-away candy with us, and it's a treat+books

Book you'll enjoy in a guilty pleasure sort of way!+P+Heard the cassette version of JACKIE, ETHEL, JOAN: WOMEN OF CAMELOT by. J. Randy Taraborrelli and enjoyed it--in a guilty pleasure sort of way.  It is a tell-it-all about the three Kenney wives and listening to it helped me relive some days of my younger days when John, Robert and Ted Kenney were alive and running for various political offices.  For some reason, I never followed too closely the dirt behind their respective careers . . . yet this book more than made up for  anything I may have missed.  If everything in it is to be believed, I now know that Joe Kennedy offered Jackie $1 million not to divorce JFK and Jackie allegedly  replied, "The price goes to $20 million if Jack brings home any venereal diseases." . . . also, that Bobby had an affair with  actress Lee Remick who actually called Ethel to tell her that they were sleeping together--only to be told by Ethel that he was home in bed (when he was actually with Remick) . . . and that Ted once showed up for drunk with a prostitute for dinner with the king and queen of Belgium, whose priceless antique coach Ted's date ruined by wetting it.  Overall, the book left me feeling sorry for the Kennedy women . . . although they appeared so glorious from afar, how they were forced to live  their lives because of the constant spotlight made life anything  but easy for them.  +books
The Children's Big Picture Book of Triathlon+N+This is too basic to be helpful.  The author admits taking most of the training plans published from popular web sites where they are published.  It spends sentences describing what other books spend chapters on.  I recommend Triathlon 101 for beginners/intermediates and The Triathlete's Training Bible for experts/intermediates.  Great pictures though (reason I gave it two stars instead of only one)?!?+books
Left to my own devices...+P+The perfrect book for a person jonesing for the complete culutral history of the jock. Well researched and well structured, the book is a comprehisive guide to everything penis. Don't let whimsical chapter titles like "The Demon Rod," "The Gear Shift," and "The Puncture-proof Balloon" fool you; this is a work of great socio-political importance. As man has evolved, so has his relationship with his organ, and to understand him, you must understand his member. David M. Friedman has given you the map towards total penile nirvana+books
Death is not charming+N+I agree with the reviewer who found this macabre.  Normally I like Jan Brett's work a lot, but I don't think that death should be portrayed as cute and funny, nor do I think that young children should be given the impression that death is a temporary state+books
A little macabre+N+Sorry to disagree with the rest of the positive reviews but I was a bit disturbed that the cat kept dying over and over again in this book.  Maybe I should have expected such based on the title, but I found it unsettling nonetheless+books
I agree+N+I agree with the reviewers who found this series "stuffy, predictable and annoying" and advised, "You might as well buy a romance novel." (Or a super-heroes comic book for the action parts.) What horrified me was that one reviewer mentioned Peters in the same sentence with Jane Austen and the Brontes!! Austen did not condone much of the absurdity and pomposity of her time, but chose to demonstrate it, rather than rant or lecture against it, as many authors and poets were doing.  In a few simple sentences she skewered inheritance laws' cruel unfairiness to women. The little girl asks, "Why do we have to move?" and her mother explains simply, matter-of-factly, that's the way it is.  As outrageous as the law itself is the docile,(seemingly) unquestioning acceptance of it.  Austen didn't go into an enraged diatribe, just assumed her readers were perceptive enough to get the message.  Peters would do well to emulate really good writers: demonstrate talents and other qualities with actions and events, rather than repetitive, tiresome descriptions+books
Augh...+N+I really didn't like this.  The idea for the seer was interesting enough, I suppose, but it wasn't executed well.  And Vesputo... first of all, who the heck names a character Vesputo?  It screams cliche.  Anyways, he was just sort of... semi-evil.  Like he was trying too hard to be manical and ended up looking like a video-game obsessed member of Generation X with the goatee and the shirt that says "I AM THE VILLAN" or some other rot like that.  It just didn't work.  And the whole... 'random assasination of the king' thing wasn't done that well.  I had to read it twice, because I was like "Eh?  What the *heck* just happened here?".  And the romance was something that you'd expect a third grader to write... the handsome prince suddenly shows up after a few hundred pages and it's all "MY LOVE!" and they haven't seen each other for what, a decade or so?  It's kind of ridiculous.  So all in all, it's something like three and a half stars for concept, minus two for execution.  But Amazon doesn't let me do half stars+books
Cute rhyming story+P+My 2-year-old son loves this book! It has a wonderful repetitive rhyme that your child will love.  &quot;Pigs in the mud in the middle of the rud. Oh, no. Won't do. Gotta shoo. But who? I'll shoo, that's who, Papa  said.&quot; My son especially likes when the Grandma says &quot;Ooooooeeee!  Up to me!&quot; at the end and saves the day+books
Interesting Comparison between WW II and Business+P+We certainly live in a time of change. And it seems that even the rate of change is increasing. In this fascinating book, Mr. Kozak-Holland draws comparisons between the problems that Churchill faced in assuming leadership of the British Government at the start of World War II and the modern business world.   The changes in the military situation facing England were quick and sudden. The changes in the business world only slightly less so. Consider, for instance, the marketplace for cameras. In a matter of very few years, the shelves at your local discount store basically no longer have film based cameras.   The author discusses a technique called Adaptive Enterprise that Churchill used in modifying the way an organization behaves in the face of change. The comparisons are very interesting to a history buff, and have direct applicability if you are manufacturing buggy whips when Henry Ford comes along+books
Less content than an average web page+N+This book has 30 pages of obvious and worthless information. The book is very thin; when the box from Amazon arrived I looked in the box and almost didn't find the book, that's how thin it is. Of course it is quality not quantity that matters, and there too this book falls short. It was not written by a psychologist, in fact the educational qulifications of the author are not revealed. He is a "management consultant to churches." The average web page has more information than this book. Definitely not worth the price+books
"He has his Father's eyes"  Not Anymore!+N+One of the many things I love about "Rosemary's Baby" is the magically timeless quality of the story.  Yes, it takes place in 1966, but it could conceivably be anywhere, anytime, even perhaps right in your very own home.  Aside from the brilliant story telling, I think that magical quality is one of the key reasons why the story remains popular.  It also goes without saying that the novel and film are both Satanic masterpieces, filled with little nuances and gems that continue to reveal themselves with each reading / viewing.  An informed eye sees much.  However, this novel almost felt like a Christian fanatic's response to the original story.  I don't know of the authors religous affiliations or lack thereof, but one gets the feeling that he ( like many others ) is trying to compensate for their diabolical work.  If you have any appreciation or love for "Rosemary's Baby", I offer you this advice.  Accept Rosemary smiling smugly as she rocks her baby in the midst of the Coven as the ending of the story.    No sequeal was needed.  Of course, you will read it.  I did myself in one evening, even as I told myself how much I would regret it later. +books
Classic Collection of Ducktales+P+As a collector, I love the quality presentation of this set of 5 stories. As a fan of the Ducks, I just love the stories, and the superb art work. I was kind of sure that I had seen the Cover Art under another name, something like the "Duck  Family Album" but thats  not too significant, since the art-work presents the characters from inside the set of stories. Probably the best thing in the structure of the stories is the way each layer flows into continuous action. "MOCKING BIRD RIDGE" shows Classic Donald, The Wily  Gladstone Gander, the Nephews, all pitted against the ever money-wise Uncle Scrooge. Of Course, few are the times that Scrooge loses out ( Since, as everyone knows, his Lucky "number one", takes care of his money skills).It's a classic setup, with a wonderful denoument. "A STICKY SITUATION"; I must admit to having no immediate memory of this great story. The Nieces look like they are early on in their design phase, but appear to be a parallel to the Nephews. The only similar story I was aware of is a diary narrative, same as this  story, done as an animated Valentines Day Special. It's massive fun, and shows Daisy and the Nieces in full form, with Daisy's Come-uppance  against Donald being perfect poetic justice. The "GRANDMA  DUCK" story is a great venue down on the farm, with Gus Goose being the prime mover, as always, by almost total accident. It's a great story with a totally sweet, but not saccharine, ending. "JONAH GYRO": This is a variation on a theme that gyro has done at other times, but the fishing technology he develops not only has the other fishermen jealous and angry, but provides for a hilarious series of events for the masterful Gyro, who proves that if he can, he will, and you will be entertained by it !!! "GO SLOWLY SANDS OF TIME": Absolutely superb in every way. A Brilliant story that has the Ducks cross the world, and only to discover that they had the secret right at home; as ever, the fun is in the journey, and this is another part of a great set.  The Paper is first rate. The binding is great, and the quality in all respects is tops. A Great buy for anyone who wants to keep this material for a long time ... another great reprint of the GLADSTONE title. [ Also: Kudos to AMAZON !!! I Ordered this on  Friday the 4th of November, and it arrived  Tuesday 9th November. Totally Awesome delivery time, and is getting consistent for Amazon. Both of the Items including this Comic, arrived in GREAT condition, and considering it was USPS, INTACT !! Maybe I got Lucky, but it's stuff like this that give me a better experience cost and value wise than any other local shop around... THANKS  AMAZON !!!!!!!!!! +books
Don't let this one lousy book put you off Robinson+N+Peter Robinson has turned into a first-rate mystery writer. But he certainly wasn't when he wrote this in 1989. No amount of gorgeous Yorkshire scenery can make up for an uninteresting cast of one-dimensional characters and an abrupt. out-of-left-field ending.  Skip this atypical entry and read  his later Inspector Banks books --they're first rate and well deserving of all the acclaim and slew of awards he's won.  This isn't+books
not the best~ eniz+N+I thought that this book was o.k. for the most part, but I really didn't like some parts at all. What really gave the book a bad effect was what LaVaughn finds out about Jody. I think that kind of ruins the book. I was very sure that she was going to talk to Jody, or something, but after she finds out the true thing behind him, I think it was a total waste of writing. I don't really reccommend this book to anyone, it had a nice writing style, but the actual writing wasn't that great+books
Uninformed+N+I belive that the author of this book is blaming society, especially Universities, a little too much.  In the beginning when he makes this assertion that Universites are racist he basis it on the astute obervation  that since there a few African Americans in the Universities that they are  racist or something like that.  Furthmore since the Military has more  African Americans it is a better instiution.  Here is a better explanation.   Universities are a lot more selective and thus can choose from the entire  population.  The Army will take anyone it can get its hands on. I just did  not like the Authors atitutde that the whole is racist. Furthermore he  knows nothing about music.  I love when he writes white soldiers are  listening to more black music and he uses Heavy Metal and Rock n Roll, both  white music!  In fact Heavy Metal is white protest music against Black  music!  Do some research or think before writting a book+books
Stumbling to the South Pole+N+As a lover of all things glacial (with Antarctica holding a particularly special place in my heart), I was thrilled to come across this book in my local library. The book promised to deliver an enjoyable blend of history, science and culture in an entertaining travelogue format. Sadly, I soon found myself disappointed. By the time I was halfway through, I was struggling to make progress through what should have been an engaging read.  Wheeler suffers for the most part from a lack of direction. Her "travels" consist of spur-of-the-moment helicopter rides to various locations on the ice that fail to be distinguishable after the fourth or fifth trip. Indeed, at times the book reads more like segments of a blog interspersed haphazardly with snippets of polar exploration history or the odd fact about glacial ice or penguins. This is further muddled with somewhat contrived musings on American culture (they're all depicted like they're ex-cowboys from Texas), or anomalous personal asides that try to be meaningful but come across as undeveloped filler material.  Individual chapters have no particular structure or purpose, and so the finished product feels a bit like slogging along through the variations of the same thing: funny anecdote, helicopter ride, historical bit, description of another station's toilet facilities or the food they eat, personal aside. After several chapters of this jumpy, disjointed writing style, following the narrative stops being fun and feels more like work. This is unfortunate; Wheeler's writing isn't necessarily poor, but seems to suffer from a bad editing job and a lack of planning.  The anecdotes are amusing, the history fascinating, but when it comes to the science and the researchers themselves Wheeler largely fails to make a case for their relevance. Instead, they come across as slightly eccentric guinea pigs with odd-but-quaint obsessions. Still, perhaps the book's greatest crime is that she largely fails to capture the beauty and utter wildness of this last frontier on Earth, and in the end I felt no closer to Antarctica than when I first picked up the book.  ~ Jacquelyn Gil+books

An 18th Century essential+P+I agree with the reviewers who've described this as a slow read. No argument there. But it's also a very important 18th Century work and one essential to anyone interested in the literature of the period.  If you read the book with an ironical slant it's much easier to see that there is actual humor in the often improbable situations. Granted, it may not be laugh out loud humor, but it is there. The poor vicar is modeled on the biblical Job, to a very exaggerated extent.  It's so exaggerated that the modern reader will likely be rolling his eyes, I know.  If you're looking for tight plot and fast pace this won't be your book, but those reading 18th Century literature will realize the novel was much different at the beginning that it is now.  You don't read THE VICAR OF WAKEFIELD for the plot. You read it for the study.  It remains an important book+books
Don't Delay !  Order "Apocalypse Delayed" Today!+P+I've read this book several times, and I would place it second only to JEHOVAH UNMASKED in its impact on the Watchtower sect. I am a former Jehovah's Witness who attended the International Convention of Jehovah's Witnesses in Chicago in 1969. I was there when then-President of the Watchtower Society, Nathan Homer Knorr, announced to the audience that "1975 marks the end of six thousand years of man's existence, and begins the seventh millennium since Adam's creation. This seventh millennium will run concurrently with the one thousand year earthly reign of Jesus Christ. Therefore the Great Tribulation and the Battle of Armageddon must occur sometime BEFORE 1975!" This prediction can also be found in old Watchtower books no longer published by the Society, such as the "Freedom of the Sons of God" book.  The Jehovah's Witnesses of today are either unaware of this 1975 prediction, or they swallow the Watchtower lies about it. When I was a Witness I was taught to "lie for the Truth." This practice was called Theocratic Warfare. The idea is that it's commendable to lie in the furtherance of "the Truth." This oxymoronic hypocrisy goes right over the heads of Jehovah's Witnesses. Anyway, that's why JW reviewers of this book lie and say the Watchtower High Command never made a prediction about 1975. The Watchtower Society has even managed to get some of the Witnesses to believe that it was the lowly Witnesses THEMSELVES, the rank and file, that made this false prophecy, not the Brooklyn Oracles (Watchtower High Command). Talk about MIND CONTROL!  So, CRISIS OF CONSCIENCE is a MARVELOUS nail in the coffin of the Watchtower Cult and it's mounting pile of dead children whose parents denied them life-saving blood transfusions. As well as the growing scandal of pedophilia as more and more Watchtower "elders" are exposed as pedophiles. The Watchtower High Command shields these sexual predators from prosecution, and instead disfellowships the VICTIMS of Watchtower sexual abuse!  Jehovah's Witnesses promote ignorance, superstition, medical quackery, and encourage pedophilia by covering it up and PUNISHING THE VICTIMS! The Watchtower High Command controls every aspect of a Witnesses thinking, telling them they cannot vote, cannot join a political party, cannot join a union, cannot join a Lodge, cannot serve in public office, cannot serve on a jury, cannot join the armed forces, cannot salute the flag, cannot celebrate holidays, cannot celebrate birthdays, cannot step inside a church even to attend a wedding or funeral of a non-Witness loved one. They forbid JW's from reading any religious material other than their own, and even forbid married couples from engaging in oral or anal copulation. They work hard to keep women "in their place" and even strongly admonish their youth against going to college, preferring to keep JW's ignorant, credulous, and malleable to their will. All of these prohibitions (and hundreds more) carry the punishment of shunning, complete ostracism, from the group. This winds up destroying the lives of Witnesses, and tears whole families apart, when they can no longer speak to their loved ones, nor their loved ones speak to them. The Watchtower High Command (The 'Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses') knows NOTHING of the Grace and Love and Mercy of God, but are the most harsh, merciless, Pharisaic, legalistic, mean-spirited, judgemental group of bitter old men with delusions of grandeur ever to walk the earth!  I was trapped in the Watchtower Religion for four long years. I know whereof I speak. It is an un-American religion that exercises FAR greater mind-control and life-control over its members than even the Pope does over Roman Catholics. Yet the Witnesses condemn the Pope for dictating dogma to his people. The Witnesses are unable to see this double-standard, the hypocrisy. They're blind, as all religious zealots ultimately are.  So, by all means purchase CRISIS OF CONSCIENCE as well as JEHOVAH UNMASKED! for a one-two combination to the face and head of the Watchtower High Command. You should "pity the fool" who becomes ensnared in the Watchtower Cult or has been raised in it, for they are a slave to the Watchtower and exist to do its bidding. Thankfully, the JW growth rate has slowed to a crawl and young people raised as JW's are abandoning ship in record numbers! :)  Would you like me to go into more detail as to why CRISIS OF CONSCIENCE was penned? I will assume the answer is "yes" and will extrapolate.  "Demons" inhabit the literature of non-JW Christians according to the Watchtower High Command, so Witnesses must be careful not to touch it and never read it. "You never know when a demon might be lurking inside a Gospel tract, just waiting to invade your body and mind!" So Witnesses are told never to read or even touch any books or literature from other religions. In reality, this is a transparent ploy to make sure the Witnesses are ever exposed to what non-Witnesses have to say about the failed prophecies, doctrinal flip-flops, and theological somersaults regularly engaged in by the Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses. The Watchtower Society holds it's slaves in the steely grip of the primitive fear of demons.  The Watchtower Society strongly discourages it's slaves from owning a personal computer or surfing the Internet. Their ostensible explanation is again "demons." The demons will infect your sin-infested mind if you dare to read anything on the Net that displays the failed prophecies, doctrinal gyrations and theological flip-flops of the Governing Body. This is also why Jehovah's Witnesses are strongly discouraged from reading old books the Governing Body no longer publish. They don't wish their slaves to know how much their doctrines keeping mutating and evolving into one monster after another.  The Watchtower Society claims it speaks for Almighty God Himself, and you'd better believe what they say unquestioningly, and obey them explicitly, or you are DOOMED to be destroyed in the Battle of Armageddon. Therefore, Jesus Christ isn't the savior of the rank-and-file Jehovah's Witnesses, the Governing Body is! The Governing Body officially and openly teach the "Earthly Class" (The rank-and-file Jehovah's Witnesses) that Jesus Christ did not die for them, but only for the Anointed Class of 144,000 who will go to heaven. Also, even though the Watchtower High Command claims to speak for God, and insist that rejecting their words WILL INSURE YOUR DOOM AT GOD'S HANDS, they claim they aren't divinely inspired! The Watchtower High Command tells Jehovah's Witnesses, in the pages of the Watchtower magazine, that they speak for God Almighty Himself. Then on the next page they declare the exact opposite, and claim they are just poor imperfect folks stumbling along just like the rank and file Witnesses, and are not inspired. Right after claiming to be God's Earthly Representatives, speaking for God Almighty!!  So, the Brooklyn Oracles have it both ways. They demand unquestioning and total obedience as God's Earthly Representatives, but plead "imperfection" and say "but we never said we're divinely inspired" when caught in a failed prophecy or doctrinal flip-flop. Which happens a LOT throughout their history. Old discarded doctrines and failed prophecies are called `old light' and today's doctrines and prophetic speculations are called "new light." The problem is that "new light' quickly becomes "old light" and often even "old light" becomes "new light" again! People who have been shunned (and therefore become as one dead to their families and friends) because they didn't submit to some ever-changing Watchtower flapdoodle, are NEVER apologized to or allowed back into the group when the doctrine is rejected for something new. The Watchtower High Command are callous old fools with delusions of grandeur, squirted full to bursting with Hubris.  Going door-to-door and obeying every whim of the Watchtower Society is how the Earthly Class of Jehovah's Witnesses prove their faithfulness to Jehovah and thereby earn salvation. They are taught they are not saved by Jesus Christ. They are taught that if they have any chance at all at salvation, it will come by belonging to the Watchtower Society and believing it unquestioningly and obeying it explicitly. So, don't admire Witnesses for their zeal. They're just trying to earn brownie points with God by fearing and obeying what they mistakenly believe to be God's Mouthpiece. In reality they don't really care about you. They only care about saving their own hides.  The Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses have passed thousands of "Theocratic Laws" about everything one could imagine. From banning blood transfusions, oral and anal sex even between married heterosexuals, to prohibiting such things as celebrating holidays or birthdays, voting, holding public office, serving on a jury, saluting the flag, or going to college! To list the thousands of laws they have enacted against their slaves would take hundreds of pages. If you think the Orthodox and Chassidic Jews have a lot of religious laws, you'll change your mind if you study Watchtower literature.   Even when I was a Witness, I knew that some of the Watchtower pronouncements were quackery both medically and theologically. Such as the blood transfusion ban. I'd never been able to take seriously their belief that "the soul is in the blood" but went along with it rather than be ostracized. To Jehovah's Witnesses it is literally a matter of life and death. A lot of Witnesses (Including children) DIE because they refuse blood transfusions. In the past, the Watchtower High Command has enforced other types of medical quackery upon the poor victimized Jehovah's Witnesses, including ridiculous "cures" for cancer that resulted in the deaths of many Witnesses.  Don't just take my word for all this, buy and read CRISIS OF CONSCIENCE and JEHOVAH UNMASKED! Both are fascinating reads. +books
A Three Hundred Page Punctuation Mark.+P+This by far is the weaker book in the whole Ender/Bean saga, but this isn't due to Card losing his stuff or anything quite that dramatic.  The fact of the matter is that this is the last two hundred or so pages of book 6.  Before the story could move anymore (SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER) Achilles had to be killed.  I'm guessing that adding that to the sixth book would have made it longer than the publisher liked, and thus what was probably one hundred pages of story had to be fleshed out, and thus diluted.  I just finished reading book 8 and let me tell you that this was a wholly necessary step in the story.  As for the lack of science fiction, I can admit that it isn't totally traditional sci-fi at this point, but it's still got most of the characteristics.  Anything in the future, after alien bug invasions, with colony worlds, and faster than light communication, well yeah that counts as sci-fi to me.  I think the biggest problem is that Card is a total sci-fi guy, and when he tries his hand at romance it comes off like a Bollywood movie.  And the babies thing, the emphasis on having tons of babies, is a natural reaction of the characters to the end of the birth control laws.  That probably explains why there seems to be an ongoing breeding infatuation.    Anyway, this book is good, but the others are great.  But we need all in the series to make it work, so this one does it's job well enough.  It can't live up to the intrigue of the others, but it makes the eigth book possible.  And the eigth was really worth it.  At least we can be thankful that they haven't become as whacked out as the last two Ender books+books
A Story to be remembered+P+Ok when I first read this book I was 9 years old and after the first time I found it my local library I was never able to find it again because I forgot the title and the author but I never forgot the story or the beautiful artwork. Now that I'm 19 and there's now the internet to use, I'm happy to have found this book again! I've been looking for this book for 10 years, it is worth the search and will be memorable to any child who reads it. ^_^+books
The Worst of Palmer+N+This book should never have been re-released.  It is that bad.  Save your time, money, and vision.  None of the characters are believable or likeable.  Meredith's story might have worked if she made her vengeful return to Billings after 10 or 15 years instead of 6.  I have been in the boardroom of a national corporation and 22 year old mothers do not have the depth and experience to head a domestic division even with an MBA.  Not to mention her unfamiliarity with society and lack of professional allies in this rags to riches story.    Cy is totally appalling.  Why would anyone trust him in business or in bed?   And yet our heroine falls for him over and over again.  How stupid.  How could he live with his mother for 30 some years and never ask about his grandmother or his relatives?  How could everyone in town have forgotten who she was if she grew up there?  And what about the mysterious Mr. Smith?  Although called a bodyguard, he acted only as a babysitter.  He could have been interesting.  Wasn't he worth a story line?  He did not even rate a first name.  Unbelievable.  This book was too, painfully long with characters I never cared about.  It was torture to read.  Even the sex was bad.  For people whose attraction was based on mutual passion it just came across as horny sex.  Put this one back in mothballs.  And Diana, do not be afraid to write about a mature woman.  Love and sexual satisfaction can still be a discovery for women over 35+books
If 'unuseful' were a word, I'd use it.+N+I am a fashion designer who was looking for some good resource books to help with figure-appropriate designs.  I came across this book after a long search and thought I had found gold.  Unfortunately, it was not what I expected.  I was really disappointed with the line sketches used to explain clothing choices and found those designs to be VERY outdated- especially considering the second printing was in 2002.  For example, I could not disagree more with the advice for rectangular-shaped women- that they should opt for sack dresses that ignore the waist, rather than trying to create one.   The chapters on jewlery choices and color charts were equally useless.   I would not recommend this book to any fashion designer looking for figure-flattering design elements.  "Dress Your Best" by Stacy London and Clinton Kelly is by far a better choice- especially considering the price+books
Concise, 1-book review for Step 2.+P+This book was more than helpful for Step 2.  In particular, it helped me polish up on dermatology, ophthalmology, neurology, and radiology - subjects not well covered in the other review books I used, and subjects which had an appreciable presence on USMLE Step 2.  It also helped me review OB/GYN at the last minute.  Look out for errors, though - others in my class found flaws in the medicine section, for example.  Otherwise I'd give it 5 stars.  Worth the price for all the high-yield information packed in this little green book+books
The COMPLETE GUIDE To TRADITIONAL NATIVE AMERICAN BEADWORK+P+With this book, the reader and bead will become one. It is obvious that the author, Joel Monture, has a deep love and connection with the Native American craft of beadwork. It is highly detailed, with illustrations and  beautiful, colored photo examples. The book elaborates, not only on beads,  but also on stitching methods, hide tanning and antler uses. Along the way  you will learn the history behind the authentic Native art. It is sure to  be pleasing and leave you desiring to know more+books
Great Story!+P+This book is a great book! I have read it many times, and every time, i find something new. This book is about a mature 9 year old girl,Libby, who lives with her parents and her brother in a tralier. When things get hard, her mom leaves them and they can no longer afford to keep the tralier. They are forced to move into a homeless shelter. Libby keeps up hope for her dad and brother about getting a new tralier &quot;when the leaves change color in October&quot; She finds ways to help out her dad finacially. It is a great story about a family sticking together through good and bad times. This is one of the best books i've ever read+books
The sequel should have been better, but was not+N+While the murder mystery was well set up, the ending was more of Agatha Christie ending, with a parlor room scene and a head shaker of a perpetrator. The political intrigue which should have been the height of this story was not focused on well enough. This is a society in the grips of an awful set of diriving forces that should have rocked the foundations of the planet. But you didn't feel that pain from the governor. The 4 law Robot introduced isn't given the same exploration that Caliban was in the first book. You do not get behind his head. The pain of transition should have been brought to bear hear as their are real world examples all around us. This missed the boat+books
A Pretty Good Book+P+I've always been casually interested in astrology, and casually read books like this a few times a year.  I saw this one and thought I had to get it, as I have a few relationships in my life that I have trouble dealing with.  This book gave me new perspective.  I think I may try some of her other titles+books
Awful Book+N+This is a how to book on taking a great subject and destroying it.  Marc Eliot writes like a reporter for the National Enquirer or any other of the numerous tattle sheets at the grocery store checkout.

CD's+N+It was unclear in the description of this book that the cd's for the listening portions were not included.  This was a huge inconvenience as I could not purchase the cd's separately+books
Success Science+P+Some may feel that the ability to be a smart decision maker and one who resolves their personal matters in wise ways is something innate to the being.  David A. Welch's guide explores the procedural manner in which one can learn to become a more effective decision maker for both large and small dilemmas in both personal and professional situations.  Welch has authored several books examining war and the Cuban Missile Crisis and is an associate professor of political science at the University of Toronto.  In the first chapter of the book, he looks at the ideal situation for decision-making and discusses the constraints that effect our decision making in the real world using everyday examples.  Welch breaks down the steps to effective decision making into nine steps.  In the second chapter, Welch explores many different types of decision-making situations and the different strategies that could be used depending on what type of decision is being made.  In chapter three, Welch decisions that can be quantified such as any decisions that involve money.  In chapter four, Welch discusses the effects of people's emotions, judgments, and perceptions on their decision making process and the importance of being aware of these personal biases when making a decision.  Chapter five is devoted to philosophical issues and moral decision-making.  In chapter six, Welch explores the belief that decision-making styles of women and men differ specific to their gender.  Finally, the book discusses habits and the importance of developing a strong decision making style in order to overcome an ineffective decision-making style.  This book was extremely informative and used many everyday scenarios that made the reading applicable to business people as well as household decision makers.  In his approach to decision making, the one who analyzes and presents options for resolving the problem situations is also the decision maker.  Therefore, it is important to acknowledge personal biases, gender issues, and moral issues, which do affect the decision-making process as well as the decision that is made+books
Incredible.  I hope there's an Inside the Kremlin Companion+P+To see the workings of a crisis, minute by minute, day by day from the inside, is incredible.  I have renewed respect for Kennedy and all those who averted disaster.  Maybe someday they'll release the Krushchev Tapes and we'll be able to see both antagonists+books
He is so smart+P+Modern artists are often attacked because on the basis of "I could have thought of that."  And true, you might say that about any given page in this book.  Yet it's unbelievable that one man thought of all of them.  Look at the photos in this book, and you'll see art everywhere the next time you walk outside.  I could cover a wall with every page that is worth framing+books
badly written+N+Stultifyingly written. No one without at least an undergraduate major in philosophy will get much out of it. I recommend that all tempted to read this should first read the Kirkham book "Theories of Truth"+books
Could not Follow the book+N+The book was to hard to follow and used words that the common person does not even know.  It seemed more like a novel to me and didn't help me understand much at all.  I would not suggest this book there are better ones out ther+books
Mediocre collection of short stories+N+The stories collected in this book offer the promise of exciting stories dealing with the Knights Templar, a topic that begs to be handled intelligently in fiction format. What the reader gets instead are weak 20-30 page stories that offer absolutely nothing for the reader that may intrigue, educate or even entertain. The authors who contributed seem to be accomplished writers in their own right, but that is not evident with these stories. Some are poorly written (such as &quot;The City of Brass&quot;) and others deal with the topic of the Templars in ridiculous ways. One thing that really bothered me was the addition of Kurtz's short story that takes place within the story of her own series of books! Basically, I would have to read her books to make even the slightest sense of the short story. Very poorly thought out. The best thing about this collection (and the only reason I gave it two stars) were the Interludes between stories, which offered up some basic info on the Knights. Definately not worth buying this book for, though+books
just beginning+P+I'm new to Crime analysis but what I have read and been able to put to use, the information in this book is great.  It doesn't go into depth but covers the many areas of crime analysis and gives a good bibliography.  For beginners like me this is a great book+books
Ruined My Day+N+I'm wallowing in bad feeling after finishing The Horse Whisperer a couple of hours ago.  I'm pretty tired of reading books about people throwing good relationships out the window because they allow themselves to become interested in someone else.  Not only are marriages broken, but trust between parent and child.  I'm also tired of authors portraying these situations as something the character "can not control," "just feels right," etc.  and then ending the book as if everyone has made the best decisions and everything has worked out for the best.    I am saddened that these people do not understand what love is, or for that matter what marriage and a family are.  The pain and heartache, the wreckage of ruined lives that accompanies adultery are suspiciously missing.  I'm writing this review in an effort to dispell the black cloud that has lingered since finishing the book.  I think that all I need now is to hug my sweet, honest husband and dear children, who know that the greatest gift I can give them is to love their father.    That is all.  My vent is over.  Thank you. +books
A fast read that is both informative and concise.+P+I read the book on a flight from Phoenix to Denver with time to spare.  The chapters are well organized and the material is reinforced to the  reader by the use of worksheets and a self-test.  Though the depth of each  of the topics covered is not extensive, the scope of the topics and the  logical way they are presented allow the reader to develop a good grasp of  the gist of project management.  I am looking to make this book a mandatory  read for employees going through our company's project management  curriculum+books
A savagely racist work+N+This epic work is currently being referenced repeatedly as a cautionary tale of what the U.S. should be careful of in Iraq.  Superlatives like "history at its best", "an all-time classic" and "superbly accurate" are being tossed around carelessly to describe Alistair Horne's history.  In fact, it remains a remarkably racist work loved by State Department officials and neocons alike - similar, but not quite on par with, the racial hatred on display in that other State Department favourite, The Arab Mind, by Raphael Patai.  In this work, Alistair Horne describes in gory detail atrocities committed by the FLN, or Algerian nationalist rebels, while skimming over far worse atrocities committed by the nice white-guy French.    Atrocities are not to be ranked, measured, and compared, but Horne's bias becomes transparent when he describes in detail and over several pages the killing of 100 French - a tragic and ugly incident, no doubt - but then blithely mentions in passing, without flesh-and-blood detail, that the French killed 6,000 Algerians in response.  Six thousand!  Most of these were summary executions of unarmed prisoners, a common French tactic, and many thousands of the civilians murdered were toddlers and elderly women.  This is but a glimpse into the sick mind of Alistair Horne, who manages somehow to see the French as victims.  He deplores the damage to the French psyche caused by their torture of thousands of Algerian civilians, without once considering the damage the torture had on Algerians, the actual people being tortured.    Horne makes cursory mentions of barbaric acts committed by the French but never draws the conclusion that French society itself may have been perverse, twisted, or morally sick.  Yet, he has no hesitation in expressing that Algerians' behaviour proves that they are somehow subhuman, or less human, than Europeans.  In short, this is a good book to read to understand how once upon a time the French, like the Americans today, felt themselves infallible, civilised, and racially superior to Arab and other "primitive" peoples.  It is an illusion that must be fought.  Another reviewer on this site mentions that Horne's book covers "Islamic terrorism", but no such phrase is to be found in his book.  Contrary to what most Americans believe today, so-called "Islamic terror" is not an eternal and everlasting feature of the modern world; in 1977, when Horne wrote this work, there had yet been no Iranian revolution, no Soviet invasion of Afghanistan (and hence no al-Qaida), no Israeli occupation of south Lebanon (and hence no Hizbullah), and no Israeli-supported creation of Hamas as a counterweight to the secular PLO.  Therefore, no such concept of "Islamic terrorism" existed in Horne's mind or in any other person's mind in 1977.  It is a failing of the human mind to write current events into history; American journalists employ it as their favourite agitprop tactic.   +books
Good Game, Awful Guide+N+This guide is probably one of the worst ever. The chapters all look alike. It takes more time to look for what you need in this than to beat the game. The game is pretty simple anyway, so it's not really needed. If you do need help, find an online strategy guide, but save the $10 for something more useful+books
Not a great book+N+I would only suggest this book if you have a lot of patience and determination to make sense of the authors code.  The source code has bugs, and many many memory leaks.  It isn't even formatted correctly. In order to make sense of it, I had to tab and format it correctly. Not fun.  There are much easier ways to do animation than what the book describes.  If you really want to know how X files work then get this book, otherwise skip it+books
Truly a Classic !!!!+P+This is a MUST BUY book!!!  A classic in every sense of the word.  Ms. Mitford did a wonderful job when the work was originally published and the "revisited" portions are great too.    As a Casket distributor, I have a fairly unique perspective on the funeral business.  Funeral Directors provide a very necessary service to society and are worthy of our praise for their work.  That being said, some of their practices are manipulative at best.  For example, I sell caskets directly to the public, and even though it is a consumers right to purchase this item directly from an independent casket retailer, funeral homes try their best to steer consumers toward their own highly marked up products.  Ms. Mitford breaks the whole process down in an informative and entertaining manner.  I think you will enjoy her work.  My website  www.SacredVessel.com has some great consumer protection related information if you are looking for additional resources.  Best wishes for your journey+books
Very believable!+P+This book seriously makes you think. NOt only is it suspenseful, it's a teen angst novel, too. It shows you what happens when peer pressure goes too far. The characters are belivable, and sometimes you hate them, and other times, you wish that they're your best friend, especially Mark, who later on in the book has a suprise secret that will leave you in a cold sweat+books
Like a trip back in time+P+If that slow, plodding Ric Burns series on PBS was the official history of New York City, &quot;You Must Remember This&quot; is the indispensible people's history: actual voices from the turn of the century (the last  century) telling what it was really like to live in the immigrant Lower  East Side, the Hell's Kitchen waterfront, Jazz-era Harlem, the last  stretches of rural Inwood. With this and &quot;The Box,&quot; Kisseloff is  hands-down the most perceptive and consistently fascinating oral historian  I've read, and yes, that's counting Studs Terkel. Buy one for yourself, and  one for a history-lovin' friend+books
Thank you Karen Houppert!+P+By page 7, I was hooked, by page 49, I was ready to write tha author a letter of thanks.   THIS IS NOT A "HOW TO BE A MILITARY WIFE" BOOK! If you want to learn how to read an LES, go somewhere else.  But, if you want to put the modern military wife into a historical context and see how, sadly, little has changed since the 1940s guides, this is an amazing book.   The author starts with a woman who has lost her Navy SEAL husband, and the casualty notification system. Then she moves into stories of living on post/base, long deployments, the expectations put on spouses and their behavior, the economics of military life, domestic abuse, PTSD and the struggle for any form of "outsider" or person who may not share the views of the majority in the military.   This book was a welcome breath of fresh air for any military spouse who gets frustrated with the limitations that a military career can often cause for the "dependent".   The stories of women are interwoven with research and statistics effortlessly.   Again, this is... well, it is an anthropological study of what it is like to be a woman married to an active duty military member in this day and age, with frequent deployments to the middle east, with the political atmosphere in the US being what it is, and the struggle that comes between the three ends of the triangle described in the book. We're supposed to step aside and let Uncle Sam come first in our marriages... but at what cost?  I think every commander and NCO should have this as required reading before they schedule their first FRG meeting.+books
Poor Concept/Outdated Info+N+This book mostly skims over our history with not much information other than dates, instead referring you to all kinds of internet websites for the meat. Unfortunately, many of the websites no longer exist (although I bought the book almost as soon as it was released), or they just cannot be accessed with the addresses given, so the book is essentially useless. Given the life-expectancy of a lot of websites, it hardly seems like a wise concept by Barrons for an entire series of books.+books
Witnesses to Freedom+P+Witnesses to Freedom focuses on the efforts and dedication of young African-Americans during the Civil Rights Movement.  The stories of protesters as young as nine years old are narrated as well as told through the eyes of the young freedom fighters.  This book highlights not only the more famous young activists that students may not have exposure to, but many young people who did both big and small things to help make the movement.  For example, the book opens with a story about Barbara Johns, a teenager who led a movement in her school to boycott for better educational facilities and resources.  The book also tells the stories of more famous teenagers like Elizabeth Eckford who integrated Little Rock's all white Central High, and Claudette Colvin who was arrested for not giving up her seat to a white person on a Montgomery bus months before Rosa Park's famous arrest.  While the book highlights specific individuals, the stories place a strong emphasis on the importance of group participation for social change.  Each young activist was working to inspire others to join the cause, and make the movement truly powerful.  Photographs are also included of the young activists which adds a personal touch to their stories of struggle and survival.  This book would be an excellent book to introduce students to the struggle and inspire them to want to learn more about the history of African-Americans.  The emphasis on the power of young people to make social change makes this book an excellent resource for children.  This book would be best suited for older children ages 11 and 12.  The book is written in a more mature format, and covers more mature subject matter+books
Somewhat helpful, very interesting+P+I myself write westerns, so I bought this book in the hopes that it would help my writings be more accurate.  While the information contained in this book isn't quite as specific as I would have liked, it does have some very interesting and entertaining facts, such as slang terms cowboys used, the terms used for the different hairstyles during the 19th century, and common diseases that plagued the population.  It also lists the different types of horses, which is a tremendous help for me.  If you write novels or are just an avid history buff (of which I am both), then I think you will find this book interesting+books
Avoid At All Cost+N+This is a horrible, horrible book.  It does not deliver what readers have come to expect from a good romance novel.  First, this novel is full of interesting history that the author does not describe in greater detail.  She is a very poor historian and should concentrate more on the romantic part of the plot.  All she does is confuse the reader with her vaguely described historical events.  Second, the male protagonist is mostly unpleasant and often cruel.  Very rarely do we see a soft spot in his heart for the heroine.  I was really hoping that there would be a major confession of the &quot;hero's&quot; love for the heroine at the end of the story, especially after the way he treats her throughout the book.  But no.  He never even says the 3 little words we have come to expect at the end (at least) of a good romance novel.  We are just supposed to assume he loves her.  Very unfulfilling! Third, there are numerous loose ends at the end of the novel.  Definitely a book to avoid at all costs+books
Great Investment to Get Started+P+My 4.5 year old knew his numbers, but when I saw the inside of this book on amazon, I realized that I have not used any technique to build his basics in counting etc., and bought this book  Numbers 1-30 starts with simple curve excercises that allow the child to  1. learn drawing curves 2. reading and writing numbers 3. introduces children [ and parents ] to focus on the stroke and the right way to write the numbers. 4. Counting as groups and allows build up pattern recognition skills  My son who was used to counting with his finger, now can count in groups by looking at a group of dots. Thanks Kumon.. I just purchased the next book .. counting 1 to 12+books
The Pursuit of Arrogance+N+Simply put, this book is the drivel of a man who thinks very highly of himself. It's like being forced to have dinner with your egotistical, drunken uncle. "Blah blah blah... And then  I saved the world and looked good doing it.... Blah blah blah... AREN'T I GREAT?!?!+books
Made me realize not to take the test+N+Although the book was extremely detailed and thorough, it made me realize that it is impossible to prepare for this exam from this book alone.+books
Too female-centerd+N+This book is really geared toward women who are into feminism. All the quotes in the book are from women in her groups. If you're not into the female-identity world, pick another book+books
Haunting and Beautiful+P+When I first saw this book as a kid it really sparked my imagination.  To this day I still get chills when I look at the pictures that speak volumes through mere implication.  Allsburg is a visual master with a mind for sharp effective prose, to which this is a testamen+books
Yes it is.+N+Yes, it IS rubbish.  And some people need to ACTUALLY... yes, I know this is a revolutionary concept for some lefties... need to ACTUALLY check out the facts before writing a review or criticizing someone else's review.  This author REALLY IS a TERRORIST.  LITERALLY.  It is a matter of PUBLIC RECORD.  He was a leader of the Weather Underground terrorist group in the sixties.  His group planted several bombs and blew things up.  To this day HE BRAGS ABOUT IT.  He says he wishes he could have planted even more bombs.  If you don't believe me, READ THE BOOK HE HIMSELF WROTE ABOUT IT.  It's available here on Amazon.  Freakin' morons..+books
A look behind the curtain!+P+I miss old fashioned letters, now that we live in the age of email. Frotunately, I still have 'real' letters saved that have now collected dust from my parent's generation, and from a time gone by.  Occasionally I stumble over published letters of famous writers in antique bookstores: Last time, it was a 800 page volume of some of Ernest Hemingway's personal letters; the first edition of this Amazon edition. They were published posthumeously, and not intended by EH for publication.  We get a peek behind the curtain, and learn among other things that Ernest Hemingway was addicted to letters, wrote lots and lots, starting in his teens; and that he was really depressed when he didn't receive replies; or when there were days when the postman brought no letters. Waiting for transatlantic mail added to his sense of loneliness. Letters were a lifelong passion of his, continuing up to the day when he took his own life. These private letters weren't meant to be published, and they are raw, but very honest.  When you read them, you are in no doubt that the writer is a true artist, and an original! They stretch over the span of his productive life, and they are varied: addressed to family (his parents, his children), his ex, to friends, including famous contemporaries, such as Marlene Dietrich (just one of them), his agent(s), his publishers, and many more.  I have a hunch EH must have been hard to keep up with, but his letters are fun to read; even though, in my view, his novels are mixed: Some great, and some I don't care for.  Guess, EH's life was bizare too. The private letters are consistent with that. And yet, they exude a special warmth; both gentelness and passion. Reviewed by Palle Jorgensen. December 2004. +books
devoid of new, practical information or advice+N+This book doesn't offer any recommendations for putting any of the advice re: better self-care in place except to suggest perhaps brewing your own coffee at home to save money to hire all the help one needs to make it all a reality. For those of us who already believe "if mama ain't happy ain't nobody happy" & set our coffee makers to brew for the morning promptly after getting our babies to sleep for the night, who would like nothing better than a regular date night with our husbands, some quality alone time, and regular refreshing breaks from our kids, this is a frustrating time-waster.    Perhaps much of this book's advice is better suited to mothers of older children who have enough disposable income to hire babysitters *and* housekeepers *and* take yoga classes *and* get monthly massages *and* take mini-vacations alone, etc..    The answer, I'm sorry to say (because it is far less satisfactory than blaming mothers for suffering martyrdom complexes & suggesting yoga to help mothers feel more "balanced") is a widespread cultural change that makes affordable child care the norm, and helps men & women shoulder the burdens of raising their children more evenly. A much more worthwhile read is "Perfect Madness: Motherhood in the Age of Anxiety" by Judith Warner.   I give "The Balanced Mom" two stars simply for acknowledging that motherhood is incredibly hard work and those doing that work need to be valued (and value themselves for doing it), which means taking necessary breaks for sustainable self-care+books
Huh?????+N+I like Block and Rodenbarr and have read many in the series.  This one is a real letdown.  Recently authors appear to be having more and more problems bringing their tales to a satisfactory close.  That's true in spades in this book.  At the end the author actually has Bernie review what the police will say happened, what really happened, and what could have happened.  It is all jumbled and unintelligible.  The book ends with a classic showdown in a drawing room like some '30's series.  That's no problem but the reader doesn't really know who half the people are or why they are there.  It's just too much confusion for a story that's pretty dull to begin with.  The author does take time to praise Bernie's illegal immigrant doorman.  Apparently Block feels that the high crime rate, astronomical High School drop out rate and appalling illigitimacy rate are nothing compaired with the joy that comes from rich Manhattanites being able to find good menial help who know their place.  People don't get much dumber than upper west side liberals+books
Hunter's Pursuit is as Good as the Genre Get+P+Hunter is an enigma - an assasin by trade, but with a gentleness that is enchanting.  While hunting for food, she witnesses a car accident.  She saves the car's inhabitant.  She later finds out that someone has put a million-dollar contract out on her.  She has no idea who will come after her, why the contract was put on her, or who her mysterious visitor is.  This is not a romance - yes, there is a romance, but it is not the focal point of this novel.  This book is a thriller - an action packed, well written thriller.  Baldwin is expert at building the tension from page one to the end of the book.  There will be times when you might want to put the book down because of the tension, but it won't be long before you return to it.  As Baldwin builds toward the final confrontation, you will find yourself reading feverishly, and staying up long after you should have turned the lights off.  Baldwin shows none of the first-book problems that so many other authors do. In this book, we experience Baldwin's considerable writing talents.  One can only imagine that if she is this good with her first book, she will be extraordinary very shortly.  You will certainly want to add Baldwin's other two books, Force of Nature and Whitewater Rendezvous, to your cart immediately+books
This book had nothing to do with being a mentor+N+I found this book to be dull, pretentious, and without any merit. Growing up in the south must have been difficult, but I fail to see what this memoir has to do with anything other than the author showing off his checkered past and large vocabulary.  Yaw+books
Ten Black Dots...+P+I have used this book for years.  I lost my copy and am so glad to have it back!  Children love to find and count all the dots.  Then we make our our dot book+books
