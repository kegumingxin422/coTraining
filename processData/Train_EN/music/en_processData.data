What! Ja WHO? Can't be!+N+This is not what I expected from such a gifted artist as Jaheim, did he change producers? The music and the man with the voice didn't go together well for me.  This is one I will not be purchasing, it is a serious down grade from his previous two albums. Better luck next time, Jaheim I was truly disappointed.+music
Not the music from this movie+N+This is not the music from the movie. This purchase was a Major dissapointment. You would do beter searching for the music credits for titles, then download the tracks form your music subscriber+music
Stick To The Movie, THAT was a treat!+N+Get's one star in appreciation of the technicians who had to record the cd. What a mess! Never should have been made. Even Julie is way past the point of playing this onstage. She half talks her way through her songs, her voice clearly not what it was when she made the film. Sorry Julie, should have left it alone.  The rest of the cast is not on a par with the film. Tony Roberts in place of Robert Preston...not on his best day. Leslie Ann Warren was riotuosly original in the film, Rachel York trying to copy her, is not. And Michael Nouri? Dismal. The songs added to the score for the stage.......forget it. Not even worth mentioning any more. Goes into the WHAT WERE THEY THINKING? file. As for Julie refusing her Tony nomination because the rest of the show was overlooked? C'mon Julie, there was a reason for that, the show SUCKED!+music
clapton suck+N+Layla is one of the most overrated songs of all time. Cream is one of the most boring bands in history. Why not do yourself a favour and buy enjoyable bands like Dire Straits, and Metallica who rock.  PS.This Clapton compilation has no good songs so please don't buy it at all+music
Dreadful!+N+I don't understand the previous reviews - I found this recording positively dreadful, with Ruthie Henshall being the only one worth listening to. John Sinclair is abominable as George - he sounds like he's doing a (bad) imitation of Michael Crawford in &quot;Hello, Dolly.&quot; He does strange things to his words - I guess he's trying not to sound British, but why is he singing &quot;Summ-ar weath-ar&quot; instead of &quot;summer weather&quot;?    The Ilona is a bass - almost literally. &quot;I Resolve&quot; has been lowered for her, and yet she still cannot master the range of the song. To accomodate her, the second part of &quot;I Don't Know His Name&quot; has a truly odd key change. Were she remotely talented I could understand key changes to facilitate her singing, but she's not worth it.    The orchestrations are odd, too, with strange sleigh bell sounds appearing frequently. The rest of the singers range from fair (Kodaly - a pretty voice but not much expression) to bad (Mr. Maraczek drags down EVERY SINGLE NOTE of &quot;Days Gone By.&quot; Luckily this is his only song.)    The Broadway revival, to my ear, still has the best voices, except, of course, that Barbara Cook (the original) outshines Diane Fratantoni, who is merely good (but who was a vast improvement over the Roundabout's original Amalia, the annoying Judy Kuhn.)     Get the original or revival recordings instead - this London version I would recommend only to die-hard SHE LOVES ME fans, or masochists. I'd rather sit through another terrible viewing of &quot;You've Got Mail&quot; than listen to this again+music
YAWN.+N+When I think of the sex pistols, I think the Monkeys did it better as a boy band. Let's face it, dears, that is all the sex pistols were: a marketing ploy. They are f-----g NSync for another generation+music
Missing his most popular song in spanish+N+This collection of 15 great hits of Nicola Di Bari in spanish is missing one of his most (if not the most) important and popular song: &quot;Lisa de los ojos azules&quot;. I wouldn't buy this CD without that song+music
2.8/10.0+N+I can't fathom why anyone would enjoy this album. The lyrics must have come out of a Dadaist poetry circle, and (most of) the guitar work is completely without personality.  What is the criterion of a good rock album? By any standards it must be a joy to play it. 6teen Stone misses the mark by such dimensions one must assume it was intentional. But it doesn't so much incite anger than it does disdain for Bush's attempts to emulate Nirvana. Where Nirvana has clearly enunciated guitar riffs and minimalist, evocative lyrics, Bush has dull, throbbing guitar drones that project nothing to the listener but a kind of malaise-inspired anger.  There's not much more to say about 6teen Stone. I could tell you about the embarrassment of listening to the lyrics on songs like "Swim": Thinning ice / 14 Hairdryers / Swimming to you / Flame on earth desire." Or the artistic suicide of the last track, "X-Girlfriend", a song composed of a little guitar-wailing and a non-stop chorus that's about six words long.  That's about all I can tell you. Mostly I figure I've done enough warning to let you make your own choice. If you do attempt this though, you ought to be told the little good news that there is: there are about 5 minutes of good music are contained on the album, split between "Machinehead" and "Glycerine." The first is an energetic, well-constructed song about control (you might have seen the music video for it about 11 years ago on Total Request Live), the second a serenade featuring over-dubbed guitars, a trembling cello, and a surprisingly coherent Rossdale. They hold the album; about as well as a couple of floor joists can hold a crumbling building.+music
Not worth the money+N+There is a reason why you cannot listen to any tracks on Amazon- you wouldn't buy if you could. I read a number of reviews and figured that it was worth a try given that Metallica was mentioned as being similar in some small way. This band is nothing even near Metallica. I have thrown the disk away- don't bother+music
ZZZZzzzzzzz +N+I've always seen Sheryl Crow as a middle-of-the-road rock artist.   My wife and I got a couple of her disc's, plus that "very best of" CD and was really looking forward to her latest, but this one...zzzzzzzz, makes me wonder what they're putting in Sheryl's coffee.   Some reviewers are saying there's "heart and soul" all over this album?  That may be, but it's also very slick dullsville stuff too.   As for the album cover graphics, I don't see the Roger Dean Yes covers or the 60's style psychedelia like one reviewer wrote, but a very "modern" graphic art that lots of artists and bands have been using. Kelly Clarkson, the Vines, the Donnas, the list goes on.  Highlights: Good is Good (I guess it's time for a new "very best of" collection)+music
Rating box would not accept 0... +N+Please change your name to (KID RAP)..  When you start producing true ROCK cd's then and only then you should put rock back into your fake name...  Stop playing both sides..  I realize that the rap- hip hop scene is much easier because over half the fan base is little girls /boys and people that dont have a clue what music is all about..  Do yourself a favor and take the rap/hip hop out of your so called music. One day you will realize that the rap/hip hop scene is like a bad smell that real music fans hate and wish would go away..          +music
O O O O O O O O O O ONE STAR!+N+When will amazon allow a zero stars rating????+music
A poor man's NOW Compilation+N+If you have children that are five years & younger, this would be a good album to put in your child's boom box or get it in cassette for their tape player.  but if your children are six and up.  Your better off finding the real songs and burning them if you can find these songs.  This album should be saved strictly for the poor folks who wnat music for their kids but cannot afford it.  This ablum would be number 1 if it were sold in Rwanda, Sudan or other third world nations since it could be sold for like dirt cheap.  Parents, if you buy this album, after your children turn 6 years old.  pack this CD and other Ki8dz Bop CD's and send them to Africa.  This is Pop music for impoverished folks+music
Clever, girls, but not clever enough...+N+Ok, first off, this is the first Corrs release i've listenend to. I'm offering my opinion without knowing anything else they may have done. I've listened to the cd 10 times or so, on random occasions when i need a break from my normal diet of punk and garage rock.  It sounds good. A little TOO good. I agree that it's overproduced, doesn't sound even remotely spontaneous. The studio work is well done, but OVERdone. I'd like to hear something else to see what they REALLY sound like.  The content of the songs is what bothers me. Aside from being sappy, sentimental drivvel (this is pop music, after all - i wasn't expecting anything else), everything sounds like a commercial ditty or a part of a movie soundtrack. Mmm-hmm.  Track 1 - I see a not-so overweight soccermom smiling on a treadmill at Curves(TM), then hopping in the Ford Expedition(TM), and cheering on the kids at their soccer game with a SunnyD(TM) in each hand.  Track 2 - Helicopter pans out as mid-20's girl drives curvy mountain road in VW Cabrio(TM)(R) with top down, thinking about handsome lover... "LMN"(R) watermark in lower-right corner of screen...  Track 3 - Sad animals. Images of puppys in cages.  Track 4 - Actually, I like this one. Mellow, laid back.  Track 5 - Ugh.  Track 6 - This one is the MOST clever! I see the band members - 3 girls, 1 guy - on one side of a table under a hanging lamp in an otherwise black room, while 3 gentlemen in suits open a breifcase full of money, push it towards them and say, "As you're aware, the radio has lost it's credibility. The kids are figuring out that there are other bands out there, beside what we pump across the airwaves at them. We need to entice them back. If you want a single, and this pile of cash says you do, then you'll do what you can to save this dying medium. Hell, you work in the word "radio" and we'll double what we're giving you." Come on, the song even SOUNDS like a PSA for the International Radio Marketing Council...  Track 7 - Sounds like a Pepsi commercial.  Track 8 - Ugh. Wait, wasn't this Track 5?  Track 9 - Sappy, but ok. Sounds like they actually put effort into the lyrics. Thumbs up.  Track 10 - Not remotely original, but alright.  Track 11 - Interesting sound. Good beat. Correct me if i'm worng, but was that a semi-Pagan reference there? That would be a bold move, for which i'd applaud them, if in fact it is. Not that i'm Pagan or anything, but hey, its a religiously positive, non-Christian reference that doesn't involve Marilyn Manson, and that takes guts. Especially for radio-loving girls bands.  Track 12 - Laid back. Almost has a jazzy, lounge feel.  Track 13 - Produced by former Ace of Base member? Bubbly, upbeat, not too bad.  Track 14 - Written and produced by Avril Lavigne...  Track 15 - WOW! A RELATIVELY CELTIC-SOUNDING SONG FROM A RELATIVELY CELTIC BAND!! And instrumental, too - big thumbs up! In fact, maybe that's the key.  Whatever. Long-winded, i know, but fair. This album didn't turn me off to the Corrs completely, but i don't have very high hopes now.  Flame away, kiddies.+music
Over-zealous fans frequently overrate mediocre albums+N+I live in Buffalo and I'm a big prog rock fan; so when I saw this CD at the library, I knew I had to give it a free listen.   But make no mistake - this CD under-delivers on many levels.    I always wanted Asia to be a great band - it had my favorite guitar player (Steve Howe), a top-shelf drummer (Carl Palmer), and a proven bass player/vocalist who was up to the task (John Wetton).  But there was always a bit too much "pop", simplicity and repetition in their music to totally engage me.  Hey, progressive rock is mostly about "different", complexity and change, right?  Asia was a progressive-pop band (akin to the later albums of Todd Rundgren's Utopia) that made good music, but didn't really pioneer much of anything.    Same with this CD.  There's little here that's new or better than the studio versions of the songs.  Palmer's long drum solo got boring after a while.  Steve's acoustic solos can be found on other Yes recordings, and done much better there  -  here, the recording quality is so bad that it sounds like he's playing tuned rubber bands at times.  (Honestly, I remember hearing better fidelity from my old Kenner Close'n'Play!)  O.K., it WAS cool to hear Steve express his pleasure at playing in Buffalo again!  But the so-called "keyboard solo" by Geoff Downs was underwhelming to say the least, and reinforced my suspicion that he was sort of the weak link in this group of otherwise great prog virtuosos.    I guess if one loves a band too much, they can blindly overlook some shortcomings on almost any CD by that band, and that's just fine for those people.  However, the OBJECTIVE reality of this CD's value comes creeping in on many other's existing reviews:  namely, the production quality is sub-par (to the point of being annoying at times); the vocals and harmonies are often off-key (you really shouldn't have to wince this much during 79 minutes of music!); this is clearly a single disk album that was issued on 2 disks for some reason; the packaging and liner notes are scant; and the performance just doesn't add much to the studio versions.  This is for Asia completists only.    Asia did make a solid 5-star progressive-pop CD with their first studio album.  I love it.  But they never improved upon it, and never stretched out into new territory.  Perhaps this 1982 live recording exposes some of the weaknesses that kept this potential supergroup from going from "good" to "great".    Support your local library.  (And in this case, save some cash!)+music
Trash at its worst+N+Their new stuff is even worse. But this is still sexist, boring, annoying music at its worst. There are much better artists out there, so why listen to these two untalented rappers+music
Below Standard, Poor Performance+N+Can this be the same D-12 that packed in witty rhymes in a non-serious demeaner? Well, I guess this really does prove they are only a side-show. Eminem has different production, so the group will have different production. Eminem went more serious, now the group is more serious.   Besides that, Shady himself (or what is left of what he use to be) is basically a no-show. In any track Eminem's in, it's usually the strongest, and that is the case here; However, that doesn't mean he was great. That means the CD itself is misconfusion, contradiction, and a side-show for Eminem's next CD ("Encore", which was better then this, but not that great overall, as well).   D-12 is the commercials to the Eminem Show, everyone's just waiting to get in between them. That's the case here+music
Wack To The Max+N+After hearing "I'm N Luv (Wit a Stripper)" I don't know why anyone would want to buy and listen to this CD in its entirety. I'm not going to type a bunch of long paragraphs about why this CD sucks. This CD is a waste and T-Pain is illiterate. There! I said it in one sentence. Holllaaa+music
Very disapointing+N+First of all FLOETIC was a brilliant album and after I heard SUPERSTAR on the radio I thought FLO'OLOGY was going to be a classic too. I was wrong. This album lacks originality, its inferior to be precise. The first time I popped this CD into the system, I found myself being friends with the skip forward button. The length of the records is despicable   This CD is not worth having....the only track that stands out for me is SUPERSTAR and I think COMMON is amazing+music
BIG Disappointment+N+I am at a loss to hear what people appreciate about this CD.  We were barely able to make it through one listening.  This is a classic example of a CD that NEVER would have been produced had the artist (using the term very loosely) not already been famous for something besides music.  The lack of talent and originality on this CD is apalling.  It only gets a star because that's the lowest rating.  I want my money back+music
Ocean Waves too high pitched and grating+N+This is anything but soothing. The tone is too high pitched; nothing like the deep bass of crashing waves along the rocky Carmel coastline that I was hoping for. I did buy the twofer and got the Ocean Surf CD by Dan Gibson and found it much more relaxing, even though it isn't a tumbling surf sound. I was able to fall asleep... which was my goal. Now if I could only return Ocean Waves.+music
Have to agree with the majority - NOT a good CD+N+Thankfully I checked this out of the library and did not spend money on it.  I felt the need to add a review though to spare those who might be thinking of buying it.  I made it through the CD once with my kids, but that was it.  We will not be listening again.  As others have said, go buy the Radio Disney CDs (or possibly later version of KidzBop if they come with better reviews).  The singers (kids AND adults!)on KidzBob are out of tune and just painful to listen to.   +music
CHEATER DECEIVER+N+If you like early Priest, buy Genocide. It has both Rocka Rolla and Sad Wings of Destiny in their entirety(the only thing it does NOT have is the original album artwork). Not leaving out important tracks like The Ripper, for pete's sake!!! How could you leave out The Ripper? And what about Island of Domination? I feel sorry for anyone that bought this that is unfamiliar with Priest. They got jipped and didn't even know it. These are my favorite albums by Priest and I hate to see them butchered like this... And what about the order of the songs? Why would they mess with that too? Do youself a favor and buy either Genocide, or if you like to have the original artwork, buy Rocka Rolla and Sad wings of Destiny seperately+music
2 dollar whore with a three dollar hairkut+N+This is the perfect example of why black women and women in general are disrespected. Lil kim is teaching generations of women to be nasty as you can be and to disrespect yourself. Then to top all of this off she is still hanging on the coat tails of biggie, the ultra fantasy gangsta rapper. Queen latifah never had to talk like this to get her name out or to make good music. This is ridiculous! Kim would be better off in a porn movie than in the rap game. Please please please spare us and stop rapping+music
WOW...what happened?.....+N+I LOVE Destiny's Child...BUT this CD...big disappointment. The best songs on the entire CD were probably Lose My Breath,Cater 2 U and Girl...big disappointment...i just wasnt feeling the CD when i bought it..+music
White Noise+N+Some reviews have suggested that this is not the ideal first purchase for the un-inititiated.  I am writing to confirm that assertion.  I have read enough raving reviews about their subsequent releases to know that it really does get better from here, but what a disappointment this album was for me.  It sounds like what you would hear coming from the garage next door.  My advice to the kids would be to keep practing and please turn it down.  Jack's appreciation of the blues is admirable, but only realised on the song "I Fought Piranhas".  Tellingly, this is the final song on the album.  Otherwise the songs are forgettable and even annoying at times.+music
Who Is This?+N+There are only two artists' music that I will purchase not having heard one note of the CD. Those two artists are Barbra Streisand and Linda Eder. "Songs of Judy Garland" was a HUGE disappointment. I was surprised at the CD cover. I don't know what "look" Ms. Eder was shooting for but she missed the mark. Instead of coming off as 10 years younger, she has been transformed to the point of being unrecognizable. She looks both spooky and a little like a petulant child.  Ms. Eder has always been a very attractive woman and definitely did not need this kind of "makeover". And the music...I tried so many times to like it. But the more I listended the more I realized I was listening to "Liza Minnelli" singing her mother's music. I did not hear Linda Eder. I'm begging you Ms. Eder, go back to what works. I'm sorry...this doesn't+music
I Don't  Understand Why This Is So Loved+N+I have to disagree with the majority of folks here who consider this cd the jazz end all. I find it grating, and darn near unlistenable. I have built a small but quality jazz library the last few months. Miles Davis, Dave Brubeck, Kenny Burrell, Grant Green, Cannonball Adderley, Stan Getz, Chet Baker, Wes Montgomery, Bill Evans and Thelonius Monk to name a few. This guy is by far my least favorite. His playing on Miles Davis cd's I have and with Monk is largely enjoyable and I know he's a giant. But this stuff?. The live recording on disc two was so grating I couldn't make it through. It sounded to me like a bunch of Geese being slaughtered. Give me the other guys anytime+music
CD not compatible with car CD player. +N+I was unable to play in my car CD player, so only choice I got is to listen at home using my home DVD player.+music
More Bullshit+N+Yep, this cd sucks. That Depeche Mode guy is really random, what makes you think anyone who is looking at the punk-o-rama review would be interested in Depeche Mode? REM sucks too, Michael Stipe is the most self absorbed old bald guy ever.+music
Heard only a few songs+N+This album is one of the only live albums that I don't have. I have heard samples, and a few extra songs on other cds though. The first thing I hear from somebody that tell about this album is basically that Stevie couldn't have been more high. His performance was just imbarrassing for the other members in the group (specifically Reese Wynans). Most poeple don't know this but, on the old vinyl copy of this album, (I've never heard it but someone told me) there was originally a 14th track. It was the song that usually comes close to the end of Stevie's sets. The song was Life Without You. Since it was the very last song, I'm guessing Stevie was more pooped than ever beacause it was the last song and that he was extremely high and everything. Being high is one thing, but being high and playing your last song in a set is terrible. In the old vinyl disc, Stevie was on his last song and he was so terribly slow that Reese Wynans walked off stage embarrased and discusted. This track was taken off the album because of its discracefulness+music
Stardust Was Good, but not THAT Good+N+Bill Charlap is undoubtedly one of the most talented, lyrcially-blessed jazz pianiasts around today.  He has a deft touch and a senisbility that far exceeds his age and life experiences.  That told, I find it very hard to give his latest effort, Stardust, more than two stars.  With very few exceptions, I found this CD to be fairly self-indulgent and Charlap rather morose in his intrepretations. It wasn't nearly a refeshing to the ear as Written in the Stars.  I would recommend this for a Charlap devotee but no one else.  He has made better albums+music
Horrible!&amp;as Bad as the Film+N+This Is as Bad as The Film.in Fact Just Like The FIlm The Soundtrack is the same old Formula.Will&amp;His Movies&amp;Music Never change the same Old Beat.The Rest Of The Soundtrack is just as  bad.UNORIGINAL&amp;BORING.What A Waste of KOOL MOE DEE+music
NICE TRY!+N+The restoration of a Vivaldi opera must be a commendable effort specially if filling in big voids and rebuilding major missing parts of the masterpiece. Motezuma is such an example where ample musical and artistic license was taken to bring it to life. Like restoring a canvas where not only the colors and forms had faded but also sizeable parts were ripped off and lost, reconstructing Motezuma presents the challenge for the restorer of thinking and dreaming, and becoming as inspired as Vivaldi. In listening to Motezuma, one can pick up the original Vivaldian compositions from the reconstructed material as clear as looking at a combination painting part Picasso part Michelangelo. As much as such painting can be taxing to the eye, portions of this opera can be as disappointing to the ear. Except for several arias and the two sinfonias, the music has a touch and taste of the 1800's, but not of the baroque settecento. The juxtaposition of the restorative style is also distractive, and just does not work. It makes at times the orchestration devoid of the Vivaldi unf , charm, and texture.   Nonetheless, Motezuma's musical beauty can be found in great arias such as D'ira e Furor Armato, La Figlia Lo Sposo, Gl'otraggi della Sorte, D'ove La Figlia?, S'impugni La Spada, and performances by Vito Priante, Inga Kalna, and Marijana Mijanovic. Bravo for Vito Priante and his interpretation of GI'otraggi della Sorte, and D'ove la Figlia. He does a great ornamentation in the da capos, and turns up the volume in all the right notes. Just like "Terribile lo Sento", and "Orribile lo Scempio", "GI'otraggi" shares the same musicalization. Somehow, this version of the score is especially more dramatic and  subtlely more melodic. +music
A First For John & Yoko+N+Well, unless you are a hardcore collector like myself (had it originally on vinyl all those years ago), stay clear of this album. If you want to hear noise that you & your wife/girlfriend/boyfriend could do yourself, then forget this album & make your own noise. The best track on the album is the bonus track. That tells you that this album has nothing to do with Beatles music. I give it one star for being terrible & one star for the packaging ;-).    Search Judemac Forever" on msn+music
DO NOT BUY IF PLANNING TO PLAY ON PC+N+This is a copy of the review on Amazon.com for Van Zant's Get Right With The Man which is another Sony corrupted title.  "This CD secretly installs DRM (digital rights management) software on your PC without your permission. Not only does it do this, but the software then hides itself by installing as a "root kit."

Sounds intriguing but needs work...+N+I don't see the comparison to Jeff Buckley AT ALL! That was a singer who had more talent in his little pinky than this band has on the entire album. All the songs are much too similar, the guy's voice gets boring to listen to after a while and, if you remember London Suede, has a very similar sound to them (though I will say that London Suede was MUCH better). No one has come close to the pipes of J. Buckley (or even Tim B., for that matter) in years and this doesn't count any where near that, either+music
pure proof that the 90's are greatly missed+N+i feel that a lot of bands were good in the 90's. this band was one of them. while yes, they were a bit poppy and sellout-ish on americana and conspiracy, they still had enough bad@ss in them to put on a rad song.  i think they should have just did a "da hui" single with "the noose" and maybe "cant get my head around you" on it. this sucks really bad. it makes the average conspiracy of one look like a bad religion album!! if you must hear, download or borrow.  please guys. quit or make good music. its pretty pathetic hearing "hit that" next to the godawful creed and nickelbland!!  so we go from a punk-ish hard rock band that is inspired by TSOL and The Damned and plays punk shows with pennywise to this...a corporate radio rock album that is loved by teenybopper frat boys and the mtv mindless+music
Not the voice she once had.....+N+As a contemporary of Joan Baez (age-wise), I loved her early music and the power of her incredible voice.  I even empathize with much of her politics, but unfortunately it's time she rested on her laurels.  Her voice on this CD is quite far removed from what she was once capable of, and in fact I would have to say that there is no comparison between her vocal ability on Bowery Songs, and her earlier quality.  Like some professional athletes, she seems to not know when to quit...+music
agree with everyone else on here+N+I just purchased my sacd player and picked up Boston and Billy Joel's the Stranger at the same time.  After listening to the Stranger, my mouth dropped.  Billy's voice coming from the center speaker and all the other instruments and melodies coming from every different direction.  Then I put in Boston and couldn't tell a difference from the cd version I already own.  I think it's one of the best albums, but if you already own it on cd, don't bother upgrading - there's nothing special about the SACD version+music
A wonderful fiasco+N+It' curious how an interesting history can be not well told by a modern music. In some cases the music go to the hand with the story, but not in this CD, in which we say the music that it is not for the story. I didn't ejoyed with that C+music
The King's New Suit+N+I would call this the musical equivalent of the worst of abstract art.  There are those that "appreciate" unintelligable works for fear of being thought stupid if they don't . . . just as the emporer's subjects "Ooh"ed and "Ah"ed in admiration of his clothing as he paraded naked in front of them+music
This single cost Britney's knee!+N+There's nothing outrageous about the title song - it's a lame, mind-numbing piece of crap compared to many other songs found on the "In the Zone" album: Imagine "Breathe on Me", "Touch of My Hand" or "Shadow" on constant radio play or running on MTV. And no, we're not apparently going to have that because Britney's precious time was wasted in incorporating this bore of a song into a single and even attempting a video out of it, like we know ended up in Britney's injury. For nothing.  Fortunately for this single, it's got the already legendary "Toxic" and a marvelous vocal mix version of "Everytime" - another star for that.  +music
DickDale-King of the Surf Guitar+N+Don't think Dale can play a song the same way twice. Didn't like the selection of songs nor  the  way they produced. +music
Not the Cheetah Girls singing+N+My 8 year old daughter was very dissappointed after receiving this CD for Christmas.  It is advertised as the Cheetah Girls 2 - however these vocals are not sung by the original Cheetah Girls who are in the movie.  The songs just don't sound the same.  It's very dissappointing that Disney doesn't tell you this on the CD+music
Buyer beware+N+Just be sure to read up on this closely... it's not the orchestra you hear in the movie, and you may be especially disappointed when you hear the vocal tracts - gone are great talents Enya and Annie Lennox, replaced by no-name voices.  This is not BAD music, but don't think you're a genius for capturing the music of the movies on one inexpensive 2-CD set+music
POP GARBAGE+N+Something that someone who claims to be COUNTRY should NOT do. Even though these girls are already pop, remixing it to make it even more pop was a HUGE mistake! Then again, they have to do something to sell more cd's! LOL!!+music
It's been a month and it still has not shipped out.+N+never shipped. I ordered this before Christmas. They said it was in stock. WHERE IS IT+music
Cruel Brittania+N+Britain, circa 1997.  Tony Blair is elected P.M.  Princess Di perishes.  And the Spice Girls are unleashed to an unsuspecting public.  This effort is an attempt to cash in on the phenomenon before a fickle populace turns their attention to the next best thing.  To be fair, the girls are not to blame for what a tedious flick this is.  Rather, they are appealing and prove to be the film's lone redeeming factor.  The fault lies in the script that tries to do for the Spice Girls what "A Hard Days' Night" did for the Beatles.  Whereas the Fab Four's film was full of wit and cogent commentary on Beatlemania this flick is unfunny and basically incoherent about what it's trying to say about the Spice craze.  I was reminded more of the Monkees' "Head" than I was of "A Hard Days' Night".  Lots of celeb cameos (Roger Moore, Elton John, et al) that amount to naught.  Oh, well.  On to "From Justin to Kelly"+music
vote it off the island+N+Vote this one off the island: 19 overproduced prog-tropical instrumentals consisting entirely of primitive thumping, chanting and grunting - sort of a new age tribal orgy with pygmy porn music composed by Phil Collins. It's all supposed to convey the drama, intrigue and relevance of a TV show (Survivor Yell, Mud Bath, Chase Race, Tally the Vote, I Can See It, Buzzed) with no drama, intrigue and relevance. A desperate last ditch dig for one of the most unimportant moments in television+music
Too bad there's no "Zero Stars" rating+N+This disc is BAD!!! Right at the 2" mark the sound of the "rock water" is join by what sounds like a slow draining bathtub. This sound is more or less present throughout the entire hour. Other discs of this type that I've heard don't do this+music
boring+N+NOTHING NEW HERE.  I like reading the ridiculous reviews of these cds where people gush all over the screens over how much they love Patton.  This cd is dull.  Suffering from Patton overexposure.  Maybe he should actually spend some time and make an awesome album (Like Secret Chiefs 3 - Book of Horizons)  rather than dozens of merely adequate ones+music
Sound like an artist still maturing.+N+When I played the first composition on this CD, I started thinking that  perhaps I had purchased a really stellar CD because the first song was  really jumping. But after that, this CD is disapointing to me. There are  maybe three pretty good compositions with the rest being totally  unmemorable. With the three good cuts from this disc and a few from her  first CD, Joyce Cooling could have made one good CD. But, in my opinion,  there aren't enough good songs here to warrant a release of this CD. Joyce  certainly has potential, but she needs to work on her creativity. She sound  here like an artist still maturing in style+music
stirrer is right, but way too generous+N+on the liner notes to one of the two blues albums (i think it is shaker) it is said that the original idea was just to perform some of these songs in a one night concert. that should have been as far as it went.  to foist these songs on an unsuspecting public at 19 bucks a crack is highway robbery.  if these are blues songs, then i am robert johnson's illegitimate son. "death letter" is good, maybe even great, but cannot compare to the original or to any of the covers i have previously heard.  the rest is a waste of time.  the cover art is excellent but hardly the reason you would be expected to buy the cd.  these are my first 2 reviews by the way, but all these 5-star reviews for both cd's finally got me motivated.  go buy a muddy waters or lightning hopkins cd and save 10 bucks in the bargain+music
So-so CD+N+There are only a couple of songs I did like on this cd. I did enjoy Ice Cube and Aaliyah, but the rest of the cd left me cold. I do think that if you can just find the two songs and pay to download them, it would have been better! I suggest borrowing first from a friend and seeing if you actually like it first before you buy.+music
meh+N+i like a little bit of it, doesent mean its good, i wont throw it away or anything, ill just let it sift...wait...and look at the album cover most of the time. slayer is getting better though+music
Bah Humbug+N+The worst Christmas album I ever heard.  I just bought it, played it once, and will NEVER play it again+music
Read this review before buying ANY ultra lounge CD+N+I can't believe none of the other reviews of the Ultra Lounge series state that these CD's contain almost all instrumental music, with very few songs that feature vocals.  I expect a lounge music CD to have a mix of both vocal and instrumental tracks, and of the four Ultra Lounge CD's I purchased, I count only three songs with vocals on all four of them.  While the instrumental songs do fit the genre of lounge music, they tend to blend into one another and become mundane after hearing several of them.  The titles of the Ultra Lounge CD's (such as Bachelor Pad or Bossanova) mean very little, as each CD fails to distinguish itself from any other because of all of the instrumental tracks.  The best lounge CD I have heard so far is from an unlikely source.  I purchased it at Pottery Barn, and it has a great mix of vocal and instrumental songs.  Keep this in mind when buying lounge music CD's so that you won't be disappointed the way I was with the Ultra Lounge series+music
20th Century Masters-A Poor Series+N+Buddy Holly has a number of collections that are superior to the one put out under the 20th Century Masters series.  Every one of the CDs in this series is skimpy in content and superfluous.  This one is no exception.   Look elsewhere+music
poppers folly+N+This CD had the makings of a great recording. The problem was telling Popper where they were performing!Butch,please record another one but leave Popper at home.He's full of a lot of things,but TALENT isn't one of them+music
I like AC/DC but I hate this+N+I like most of AC/DC's music, but I can't stand their latest album Stiff Upper Lip.  Stiff Upper Lip is the only AC/DC album where you can play it all the way through, and not even hear one good song.  Stiff Upper Lip doesn't even come close to being as good as Back in Black or Highway to Hell.  Every song on it just bugs the heck out of me.  Listening to one song off this album is enough to test my patience; but enduring all 12 of these musical abominations is enough to drive me crazy!  The overall sound is very similar to their earlier albums like Highway to Hell or Back in Black.  BUT...those CDs had variety, they were semi original, and they were actually pretty good.  THIS CD is just completely worthless.  I have heard some cra ppy CDs in my lifetime, but none of them were more pain to listen to than this.  The vocalist sounds about 10 times worse than he did on their earlier albums, the music is chunky, repetitive, dull, and boring, and most of the songs sound the same. Stiff Upper Lip is so bland and dull sounding that it sounds more like the monotonous droning of an electric fan than a rock n roll band.  The music is so repetitive and similar sounding that its more like listening to the same annoying song for 60 minutes than 12 separate tracks.  This CD is just unbelievaby terrible.  It is a disgrace to this band's legacy, and the band members should be embarrased by it.  Oh well, I guess they probably only made this album because they needed to fulfill their record contract, so I guess they don't care about how awful it is anyway.  All I can tell you potential buyers is to stay as far away from this piece of garbage as possible.  It is a TOTAL piece of cr ap and it is not fit to listen to.  Go buy a GOOD AC/DC CD like Let there Be Rock, High Voltage, Powerage, Highway to Hell, or Back in Black.  Stiff Upper Lip suc ks so hard it leaves a big purple bruise.  It's so awful I'd rather listen to the new Nickelback CD than this!+music
Song not on CD+N+To those of you interested in this CD in lieu of finding the &quot;songs with lyrics&quot; in the movie ICE AGE, got bad news for you. They are NOT here!  I really do hate it when a soundtrack is put out for a movie and they don't include the best or features songs in the movie.  Anyway, the song that pretty much everyone wants when Manny, Sid, Diego and the baby are together and walking towards Half Peak is called &quot;Send Me On My Way&quot; by Rusted Root. It is on their latest album &quot;When I Woke&quot;. Put Rusted Root in the Amazon search engine and you should find it.  Hope this helps those looking for this song+music
Ok but not a bel canto singer+N+Anna Netrebko's I Puritani selections are way below the art and skill of Callas, Sills, Sutherland, Caballe, and Gencer. She has no passion, no trills, no high notes that are deep and rich. Her best is in the Russian repertoire and possibley some undemanding Mozart.   Her broadcast from the Met Live of the I Puritani was alright, but scooping, avoidance of repetitions, running through passages like a locomotive, and an ending that would have brought the wrath of most opera houses in the world..scooping again, and a tight awful sounding high note. The same tentativenes is also here on this CD.She should know this. Her beauty and acting and allure are what interest the masses, not the voice, which is forgiven everything.  Too bad; she could be a lovely Tatyana some day.Also too, the Traviata is not that great; Anna Moffo , Renee Fleming, M. Caballe, and of course Maria Callas..Listen to these and hear the difference+music
Sorry Pac, I know your turnin in your grave for this+N+Yo Nu-Mixx sux i hate when people make cd's like this to make some money off of great artist like Pac. This cd is disrespecting Pac and nobody should get this if your a Pac fan. They take great songs and make crappy beats. Get this if you want to support Pac haters or waste your money+music
One Star For the One Track I Liked+N+I'm going to the trouble of writing this review to warn you: this cd is not like the other Putumayo cds. No, it is not fun, hip, relaxing, good to dance to, or stimulating. It is a selection of hackneyed Sinatra-style slop sung by a variety of leery-sounding men with fake deep voices. I have this rule for music: if it makes me think of animated dogs kissing over pasta, it sucks. Consider yourself warned. If you like good music, try French Cafe instead+music
Gut bustin humor for people who miss "hee haw"! NOT!+N+This is humor? When does the humor begin? Is it close to the end cause I reckon that this ain't funny. Maybe the fans of this guy can go home and beat there spouses with banjos and leave the rest of us alone, I reckin+music
Extremely Borrrrrrriiiiiinnnnnnngggggg+N+This Air Supply should've been cut off a very long time ago.  Whenever any of their songs comes on the radio I immediately shut it off.  Bad ear candy is all they ever recorded.  Mindless, sappy garbage.  Even Bread's music  was more interesting than this+music
Please turn them down !+N+This cd its just horrible, they sold only 10,000 copies enough to pay for their instruments lol ! There are better bands than this an example is bleeding through so i think no one cares about a re release peace out+music
Rockin Randall????+N+At no point in my following review am I by any means intentionally downing Hank Jr. I am just trying to give an honest review of this cd.  At the time this album was realeased, Hank Jr. was riding high, winning big at the CMA's and ACM's.  He was also releasing some of the most critically aclaimed country records of his recording career.  But then for some reason he decided he needed to record some rock and roll.  To me this cd is a studio recorded version of a Hank Williams Jr. live concert.  The only difference is he didn't botch the vocals as he does on his live show.  The music is decidedly 80% not country, it drifts towards eighties rock.    If you trace Hank Jr.'s recording career, you can point at this cd at the one that started the downward spiral that he has only began to pull himself out of.    I must say though, this cd contains one of Hanks last top 10 hits, "If the South Woulda Won," which is an hard to find recording on his compilations.  I'd say this cd is kinda essential collecion wise, just because of that song. +music
Surprised+N+I wanted to give this CD as a gift to my 7 year old niece who loves the movie.  I listened to it first to make sure the quality was good. I was so surprised when all I heard was music and no words.  Although the music is nice, I know she would not be too impressed. We had seen the movie together and we loved Mr. Ray's song and wanted to know the words.  It's too bad that I'll have to return or sell it+music
One of the worst mixes I've ever heard+N+This never should've been pressed.  They should've taken the mix and thrown it out.  DO NOT BUY!!+music
Yikes!!  Singing is  way out of tune!+N+The singing is terrible on "Fly Me To The Moon".  Don't take my word for it.  Listen to the free sample supplied by Amazon.com .  At 16 seconds into it, when she sings "all I worship and adore", she goes almost a whole note sharp for several notes!  Even someone with no musical training can hear it.  The rest of the pieces sound fine+music
Your stupid mouth will get you in trouble. +P+I just want to put it out there...Audra McDonald is an absolute genious. Everything she touches turns to gold, and I just want to smack some of you for saying that she failed in her attempt to make a great record. This may not be the audra that we are used to, but if you listen closely she's near by. So this CD is a little less difficult vocally. So what? My favorite quality of Ms. McDonald's is that she is emotionally connected to whatever she is singing. She could record twinkle twinkle little star and I would want to listen to it over and over again because she tells a story. So if you buy this CD, listen to it more than once. Let it grow on you. Let Audra do her thang children. Let her do her thang.+music
best brit album of 04+P+if you do not own this album you must get your hand on a copy. It is the best debut album since definatly mayby. Tracks like &quot;golden touch&quot; &quot;V.I.C.E&quot; well lets just say every song on the album is a bonnifide hit including the banging&quot;stumbble and fall&quot; which will have you tapping your toes from the first 2 seconds. If you like the libretines or the others or are just looking for a solid cd this is a must have+music
I'm feelin these+P+I won't say to everybody this greatest hits is highly recommended. Being that I never heard all of her albums, so a true fan may feel like some songs is missin'. However for me, who is just really startin to seriously get into pop is somewhat satisfied with these and this is a 5 star collection to me. Some of the tracks I love, a couple I don't like at all and the rest I just like. My favorite ones are in order; Erotica Ray of Light Beautiful Stranger The power of goodbye Deeper and Deeper The prodution is excellent and I love the vocals. If your new to Madonna, my opinion would be to start here. But a true fan can give me lessons.+music
Iron Butterfly Live+P+As one of the founding fathers of today's heavy metal rock music, Iron Butterfly has them power, drive, and sound that made them unique in the world of rock music. This live album serves as a testament to that fact. Eventhough the recordings of live concerts from the late 1960's through the mid 1980's was primative at best (by today's standards), this live recording of Iron Butterfly captures most of the groups best music durring their prime as a chart-topping group of that era. This is a "must-have" for all Iron Butterfly fans+music
Trippy+P+I bought this CD before going to see MMW (with John Scofield) for the first time at First Avenue in Minneapolis Dec 7, 2006.  I had never heard of them before and liked the clip on the venue's website.  So I bought a ticket and wanted to get "Out Louder", which I knew they were going to play, to familiarize myself, but the store I was at was out of it.  So I bought "End of the World" instead.  While some of it was a little too spacey for my liking at first, I still liked the overall funkiness of it all.    THEN....I saw them PLAY.  You MUST see them PLAY!!  I didn't ever want it to end! I immediately wanted to see them again!  It's less than a week later and I have 2 more CD's ("Out Louder" and Scofield's "A-Go-Go" which they "back" him on) and 4 more on the way from amazon as I'm writing this.  I'm like an ADDICT now!  I HAVE to have them on in the car and in the house.  I get back in the car after having been in a store or whatever and they're on and all is right with my world again.    I must say I like "Out Louder" and even "A-Go-Go" better than "End of the World", but only slightly.  It IS trippy with the synth and the other guest players, and I do like it better after a few listens.  I just prefer MMW with less guest musicians+music
"Can She Excuse My Wrongs?"  Probably not...+N+While I have no doubt of Sting's genuine admiration and love for Dowland's music, the performances here simply will not do. He has obviously learned the notes very carefully, and he does make it through each of these challenging songs...but just barely.  Never do any of these performances really take off and soar and become true interpretations.  The entire enterprise remains firmly earthbound and doggedly "note-for-note" in its approach.  To be fair, subtlety and nuance never have a chance with the all-too-close "pop" miking of Sting's voice, which makes it sound like he and the excellent lutenist Edin Karamazov weren't even in the same room when performing. Moreover, Sting's proclivity for nasal vocal production and oddly colored vowels tend to render the highly poetic texts almost unintelligible.  Add to this Sting's hokey "Masterpiece Theatre"-style readings from a letter of John Dowland to Sir Robert Cecil, chief adviser to Elizabeth I, and some ill-advised multitracking effects, and the whole experience quickly becomes unlistenable.  In which case, I won't carp about the disc's rather meager running time of 48 minutes, since even at that short measure, it seems much longer.  I'm just glad I didn't shell out for the disc; I borrowed it from my local lending library, and it goes back at the end of the week+music
Please enter a title for your review:+P+I'm going to avoid focusing on the politics involved here and focus on the music. go to the moveon.org and musicforamerica.com sites and judge for yourself whether they're causes worth giving money to. If so, read on, if not, browse for something else.   Though primarily focused on "indie" acts, this album is still pretty diverse, which can be both a good and bad thing (whose idea was it to follow up a typically jazz-pop-rap track by Will.i.am from the Black-eyed Peas with They Might Be Giants' cover of William Henry Harrison's 1840's campaign song?). Highlights include the aforementioned TMBG song, OKGO's surprisingly subtle cover of The Zombies "This Will Be Our Year", former Soul Coughing vocalist Mike Doughty's "Move On",  Laura Cantrell's haunting rendition of country classic "Sam Stone", and the late Elliott Smith's "A Distorted Reality...", soon to be available on his posthumous album From The Basement On The Hill. The problem lies in too many live/alternate versions of things; the "acoustic" rendition of Fountains Of Wayne's "Everything's Ruined" improves on the far too muted original from their debut album, but the Blink 182 remix is barely different from the original (which isn't a good song to begin with), the Bright Eyes live track is gratingly drawn out, and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs live version of "Date With The Night" is too murky to really capture their manic live shows. As a compilation, this album has a few flaws, and is a bit overstuffed with alternate versions and live material, but overall it's got enough good material to warrant purchase if you like at least a handful of the bands involved, and again, you believe in the cause.+music
Nice recap+P+It's no box set and therefore (inevitably) excludes some tunes I wouldn't have, but this is a good sampler of Tom Scott's 70s &quot;heydays,&quot; including the crank-it-up &quot;Gotcha&quot; (Starsky &amp; Hutch TV theme song) and soulful &quot;Shadows,&quot; among others.  I was disappointed more from &quot;Blow It Out&quot; wasn't included, but overall it's a good (not great) single album's worth of Tom Scott.  If you like 70s fusion (for lack of a better term), you should like this.  Certainly worth $..+music
Frank must be turning in his grave...+N+I've been listening to Frank Sinatra for years, and this kind of stuff just leaves me cold - I'd rather here the man himself...  Or, for a completely different take on the material, someone with a completely original approach like Shamus Dark, and his album "Songs For Suicidal Lovers", which sounds like nothing I've heard before, whilst staying true to the fantastic songs. As www.evolutionofmedia.com said: "...aural film noir...delve into the dark side...+music
Another classic album from Prince+P+Prince's 1981 album CONTROVERSY is another classic album in his catalog. The title track is the standout immediately. This longer version than the single version features a prayer. The song is funky and effective. "Sexuality" is a great disco/funk number. "Do Me, Baby" is probably one of the sexiest songs he's ever done. This full length version is the one to hear. "Private Joy" is another funky song which is another favorite on the album. "Ronnie, Talk To Russia" is a short protest kind of song. Same goes for "Annie Christian", which he wrote about the shooting of John Lennon, Ronald Reagan, various Atlanta child murders. Not as effective as "Ronnie, Talk To Russia" but a decent track nonetheless. Overall a highlight in Prince's career+music
very disappointing+N+I bought this CD because it got a lot of good reviews, and the description sounded like something I would enjoy. However, it turned out to be an atrocious CD. It is very repetitive and monotonous throughout. The songs pretty much all sound the same. There's little melodic variation, and the vocals have basically no range. The lyrics are extremely uninspired. I'm glad I bought this used at a cheap price. I don't know if I'm going to give it away or just throw it away; it's that bad.+music
Boring....zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz+N+I purchased this cd expecting a solid group of songs from JMM.  However, this album really lacks when it comes to good material. There really isn't one song that stands out, nothing worth playing over and over.  The entire album is pretty much "blowing flowers out of your [rear end]" types of songs. The title cut, "Pictures" is about a guy that likes to take pictures of his family and looks forward to taking more.  It sounds like something an 8 year old wrote.  Rather than wasting 15 bucks on this cd, get a Pat Green or Brad Paisley cd, they are much more worth your money+music
My kids love it, and yours will, too+P+I have been "making" my kids listen to the music of TMBG for years, but I no longer have to "make" them listen.  My 6 and 7-year-olds actually "want" to listen to songs like "No!," "Clap Your Hands," and "Four of Two."  Although this is not TMBG's best CD (some say it is "Flood"), this is my kid's favorite TMBG's CD+music
Magic Time+P+This CD will really grow on you. So listen to it several times before you make your final judgement. It is one of Van Morrison's best.  This CD appears to be almost Autobiographical at times. Especially STRANDED...JUST LIKE GRETA...THEY SOLD ME OUT. His Jazz background, his Irish background, his Blues  background...are all present on this CD.+music
big disappointment+N+i usually dont add my two cents to highly reviewed music but in this fickle world you are only as good as your last album,and since we usually have to wait half a decade for you to spit out another this makes it worse. Ive seen Sade often in concerts and she has always had a great sound. this album is more pop. If it ain't broke don't fix it+music
WTF?!?!?!?!?+N+Remember the days when we were punks and we'd gather 'round the phonograph and listen to some Puccini on the old Edison cylinders? They held up to 4 minutes of music! Count 'em, 4 minutes! Then that hippie opera singer Enrico Caruso came along and all the young punks would listen to him, including myself. He was quite the singer. When I was a young kid though, the only form of music we had were the concerts. I remember seeing Franz Liszt play the piano in concert, quite an amazing virtuoso, and Johann Strauss Jr. conducting his orchestra, those were the days.   Then they came out with those things called grammophones, which were even more modern, if it was even possible. But it was, because then they came out with a new modified version of the phonograph that all the young punks would listen to, lazy kids. I mean, you didn't even have to crank a handle like you had to with grammophones. And what's this, 1 hour, a full 60 minutes of music, on 1 record? Pshaw! 4 minutes of music was all I needed, and I was still pooped out even after that. In my day, it was bed at 4 p.m., breakfast at 2 a.m., then off to the mines. We didn't have 60 minutes of free time.   I have no idea what form of music they have now. Appearently, they came out with a couple other things after the phonograph. Now all I see these days are kids with their fancy eye-pods (?) and MP3, MP4 players, whatever they're called, listening to that "hip-hop" tomfoolery of theirs. You can't even call it music, it's just noise. Well, gotta get ready for bed now, it's almost 3:45+music
Kut Klose.......Ladies I'll Make You Surrender +P+Tabitha, Athena, and Lavonn, I'll leave all of my women for you three.  Let's talk music, Surrender, I Like, Keep On, Giving You My Love Again, and the songs with Keith Sweat sound great.  These ladies were in the range of groups like SWV and Jade.  That's a good class to be in. +music
this is it,michael jackson is officially more punk than warped tour+N+wow...i look at this track listing and it makes me cringe....i mean i know that warped lost its punk credibility back in 2003, but this is just overkill....relient k, academy is, everytime i die, from first to last, underoath, matchbook romance, saves the day are reasons not to support this tour(for all those people who go just to see NOFX, Casualties, and Time Again)...i REALLY give bad religion and rancid props for not being on here this time around! this is worse than last year's by far....but what could you expect? these tours over the past 3 years have been on a downfall...i mean the bands that are good on this aren't really worth the agony and disgust to want to purchase this and/or purchase a 40$ ticket to one of the shows. to me, that is a scam...im so glad that people stopped referring to warped tour as a "punk" tour...i mean maybe if NOFX gets a hefty amount of boos from those trendy scenester hot topic kids, then maybe even those guys can see what hell this "nu-emo" trend is.  now, i am not going to go off on some explosion about what real punk is, but i will say this....fans of warped 2003 and back...steer clear..this is merely a compilation of green day-esque bands(minus Time Again and Casualties..and maybe 3-5 other decnet bands)....some are turned up a few thousand jolts and some are slowed down a little bit, but i bet any of them will admit that bille joe(brainless) armstrong is a deep inspiring figure.  all we are really missing here to make this the ultimae pile of crap is fallout boy, simple plan, yellowcard, blink 182, good charlotte and new-school afi.  bottom line...avoid like the plague and maybe it will change next year for the better!......most likely it'll be worse, but hey, stranger things have happened+music
not what I remembered+N+i gotta say I used to love this album back in the late 70's . just purchased again thru amazon here and it really isn't as good as I remembered . . .they are quite loose, the songs don't stand the test of time, the playing not nearly as great as I remember it to be. . . surprisingly rough on groove. . . . not a true classic - i thought it wa+music
Get Over Yourself Dude+N+"With 22 tracks sprawling over 74 arse-numbing minutes, Cripple Crow is hopelessly self-indulgent. It's a pity, because on the few occasions when Banhart applies the quality control - as on the short but pretty 'Dragonflies' - he shows flashes of McCartney-esque melodic craft. Generally, though, Banhart is happiest when he's wasting an hour and a quarter of your valuable time with his witless meandering and irritating stoner-drawl. "  "Already this year we have heard the awesome Amadou & Mariam record on which producer Manu Chao brilliantly fuses western pop sensibilities with ethnic sounds to create fresh and invigorating music. In comparison, Banhart's feeble grasp of world/folk music comes across as a shoddy, flashy sweatshop counterfeit."  It's probably this month's top-seller in Tower Records of Goa, however+music
Great follow up album+P+I dont know what the fuss is wether the fans will be accepting to The Killers new sound and look, I for one love it! By the 3rd time i heard the album, i knew there was no way i'd be able to stop listening to it for a very long time, just like Hot Fuss. The songs are great, the hooks are awesome and its so polished to perfection.+music
Bad Halloween Effects+N+I purchased this CD and I was ripped off. The sounds on the CD are pathetic. They are of poor quality, with one person standing in a sound booth. I could have made a better recording with my tape recorder and mic myself. I was looking for a CD to compile a string of sounds for my Haunted house. Now I have to find another means of getting these sounds. DON'T BUY THIS CD. You will not get your moneys worth+music
And now it's time for another hate review+N+Well what the hell to expect from a big cynical misanthrope such as myself?  Flowery bubbly warm rays of sunshine?  HELL NO!  You see folks it's people like Lil Jon that make me think in such a morbid manner.  When I see Special Ed. failures who look and act like mental house rejects make lots of money I tend to get a little pessimistic.  BUT CAN YOU BLAME ME?  Seriously, let's screw our heads on tightly and think about this for a second, why would a sane person actually listen to let alone actually purchase this cd?  This is a complete joke.  I'm simply calling it like I see it.  Lil Jon deserves no respect from any human being, not even his crack head of a mother.    Actually you might as well compare Lil Jon to Elmo, Elmo being a puppet has a MILLION times more skill at what he does.  At least Elmo is a good and wholesome children's icon that kids can have fun with.  If I ever have a kid someday Elmo will still be a hit with the kids but Lil Jon will still be laughed at once all his "fans" grow up and realize how stupid they were to actually buy into his garbage he pans off as "music".  Meh, well who I am kidding this review (like my last 6) probably won't even get posted anyway. +music
DOORNOBS ARE SHINY+N+My alarm clock is set at 3:40. Superhero underwear is cool. CD Drives blink. I got a concussion from the fire alarm. Puppies will conquer the world. Wonder Woman Would beat up Superman. U r the coolest person in the world. Thank you for looking at this useless revie+music
New Age Supertramp Anyone?+P+OK I can't myself here, but this guy really listened to a lot Supertramp growing up or something.  I liked to album, but I can hear hints of Supertramp's style in about half the songs here in different degrees.  "Bad Day" probably the most notable of the bunch really sounds like something that came of the "Breakfast in America" album to me.  Still the album is enjoyable though, especially if you did like Supertramp.  I get the Leo Sayer hook, but I think it's off a bit.  Leo never used that many keyboards+music
have NOT received it+N+i would review it if i got it. come on guys. i placed the order on 1/6/06.+music
I was not  thrilled+N+The songs just did not get me dancing.  I have to say I was disappointed.  But I love Kids Favorite Songs VOl 2 but was never able to buy it as it was not availabl+music
Boiling Water+N+I was listening to water boil this morning. I preferred it to this album+music
Blue October.. instead.+N+Is it true that the lead singer for Hinder only records while he is on the toilet constipated? His voice sounds so. The way he sings "Lips of an Angel" makes me want to punch him in the face! I'd rather pick dried semen out of my pubic hair over listening to this group. I seriously almost tripped and fell at work trying to get to the radio and change the station before I heard the chorus! +music
Not Just for the Kids+P+This music so so wonderful.  It is very high energy and fun.  The kids don't really care that this a "jazz" album- what they do know is that they love the music and it makes them feel happy.  Don't waste your money and insult your kids intelligence and your ears with the what sells as "kids" music, get them something you can both enjoy.  Our favorites are the "Doodle" song and "Potato Chips."  Worth every penny and then some+music
Terrific for kids and parents too!+P+This is one of the best kid CDs I've heard.  The songs are all catchy and fun to listen to.  It's a great intro to jazz+music
Why is the world in love again?+P+This was They Might Be Giants first major label album.  It continued, and expanded upon, the sound they had established on their independant label albums.  It's probably TMBG's most popular album.  It features many classic TMBG songs, like "Birdhouse in Your Soul", "Istanbul" and "Particle Man".  It's chock full of the catchy melodies and silly lyrics that we have come to expect from the Johns.  A must have for all They Might Be Giants fans+music
great music!+P+Our 22 mo. old loves this music much more than the kiddy tunes that mom and dad can hardly bear to listen to.+music
Very catchy album+P+Hot Hot Heat's Make up the Breakdown is a follow-up of Knock Knock Knock. Personally, if you're a big Hot Hot Heat fan, this will be one of your most favorite albums. Each and every song is unique and has catchy beats that will make you want to dance. The first song Naked in the City Again is great.  The second song, No, Not Now, is a popular tune that you can't help but start movin'. Get in or Get out has some of the most rad keyboarding parts. Bandages, one of the biggest hits on the album is sort of what boosted Hot Hot Heat's career and just this one song will make the album worth purchasing. Oh Goddamnit is such an amazing song, with very fun lyrics so you're bound to sing along. The next song Aveda keeps many of us wondering: Ex-Girlfriend or Hair Product? Either way you'll like you'll still enjoy this song. This Town, many believe was written about some crazy fans, you listen and decide for yourself. Talk to Me, Dance with Me was also a very big hit that got fans into Hot Hot Heat. This song makes me dance, sing, and every other thing you can do to your favorite song. On Save us S.O.S. you will love how deep the lead singer, Steve Bays' voice sounds, your heart will melt. Although very different from Hot Hot Heat's normal songs, In Cairo, is also a great song and adds a fabulous ending to Make up the Breakdown. This cd will be in your stereo for hours on end. The songs are addicting so this album is definately worth it's money. +music
Just terrific!+P+Wonderful harmony, great voices, beautiful music.  This group deserves to be better known and to be hugely successful+music
Mediocre Music with Horrible Vibrato+N+The first time I heard about Antony and the Johnsons was from a friend of mine that told me about Rufus Wainwright and was listening to a new artist that was quite incredible.  I decided to do some investigating about this Antony at a local Barnes & Noble and what I discovered was very, very dissapointing.  I find the music to be well written instrumentally and layered quite well, but Antony's voice is very over the top and fake.  By fake, I mean his use of vibrato, which is very rapid and used in a way that comes out as forced and sheeplike (not natural).  Professional voice instructors teach that the correct way to use vibrato is at the right speed: five to six vibrations per second.  It is evident that Antony's "trained" sounding voice is not trained at all in this realm.  Another thing about this band and record that I find very horrible is the lyrics to the songs.  The artist seems confused or regretful of his own gender using a sorrowful and painful delivery of these wailings.  The lyrics hold no attraction or relation to the listening, which lends the listener to a pitiful and almost annoying view of the music itself because of this.  My conclusion is that this is a terrible record and the singer needs to pursue professional voice lessons... and help+music
Energetic+P+St. Elsewhere combines the energy of club beats with the soulful [and at times wistful] voice of Cee-Low and thought-provoking lyrics. I enjoy the variety of styles [from the frentic "Go-Go Gospel" to the introspective "Just a Thought"]. A must-have purchase+music
classy goth type stuff.+N+the music can be explained and defined pretty much as the title itself just think of "classic". I assumed the music was going to be very club material that has a history of songs being played after the years by clubs.. a large portion of the cd i cannot see it as a gothic "club" material esspecially throwing in some type-o.. i been through alot of clubs and i cannot find a way to hit that song in the dance floor.. if not i guess i have been in the wrong places.. it looks to me they ran out of ideas and threw in some mainstream that everyone listens to so they would  i was very dissapointed in the whole cd. listened to a few songs here and there, if you are into the old stuff then this is the stuff for you.. i really dont recomend this cd to any collection besides you want to be blasted in the past.+music
Not Bad....Not Bad At All!+P+Having left my Gothic Club mix CD at home, I decided to buy this one. What hooked me first was the live recording of "Bela Lugosi's Dead" by Bauhaus, which is classic Goth music. Some of the bands I liked, some I didn't, but all in all this is a great CD. My favorite is "Sheryl" on the second CD. This is a great CD for chilling, dancing, or showing the uneducated masses what Goth music really is+music
Not A Very Good Debut...+N+Tony Yayo's "Thoughts of a Predicate Felon" suffers from the fact that Tony Yayo simply doesn't know who he is (or who he is supposed to be) on this album. Before I listened to this album, I expected to hear gritty, descriptive rhymes about Yayo's criminal life. Unfortunately however, I, like many of you, tuned into tracks such as "Tattle Teller," "Curious," and "Project Princess." For an ex-convict, that is not the type of message you want to project to an audience that is expecting something more... hardcore; something better. On tracks such as "Live By The Gun" and "Homicide," Yayo delivers my aforementioned desire for "harder" lyrics, but tracks such as these are few and far between. Hopefully Tony Yayo can focus on doing this for his next album but for now, this debut album is simply a dissapointment+music
Lil Jon and the rehab clinic+N+I think this album is boring. I think it doesnt do its job. I think Lil Jon is a wannabe. I think they needs to get a real job. I think this broke very soon after i got it. I think this won't play in most cd players. i think the cover looks stupid. i think it gave me the idea to scream YEAH! and WHAT! at my brothers wake. i think art is stupid. I think i don't recommend this. I think ive said enough. I think im going to hell now. I think i was anyway, cause i think i sold my soul+music
Bob Dylan-Modern Times+P+This album is a masterpiece by a legend who, at 65 years old, topped the charts. Dylan is an extroadinary talent and seems to get even better with age. Every song is exceptional and showcases his great talent and songwriting ability+music
uplifting summer love song+P+I first heard this song last summer while I was painting our house. Out in the fresh air and the sun (and recently wed), this song immediately caught my attention and only seemed to get more irrestible with every listen. While it's what I guess I would call somewhat of a "rock" song (during the chorus),  it's Alex Band's vocals that conveys the longing, passionate love element of the song. He manages to keep it romantic and unique instead of just making it a another decent rock song. I've also heard Chad's version from the album; while Chad's vocals are actually not *that* much different from Alex's (both manage to be very masculine and strong), I feel that the version with Chad is a "good" song while Alex's delivery makes it a "great" song. While Chad's voice is great for other songs, for this type of song it is overly domineering and angry-sounding. From a woman's perspective, Alex's way would manage to convince me to "get together" while Chad's would scare me off! Sometimes, one vocalist is just "meant" to sing a song and either make it or break it. Think of "Smooth" from 1999. Rob Thomas' delivery helped to make that song the hit it was. In this case, Alex is the perfect man for the job.+music
Excellent, ten-star children's music record!+P+An outstanding set of kid's music with folk scene stalwarts such as Arlo Guthrie, Taj Mahal and Tim O'Brien joined by bluegrassers Tim O'Brien and Rhonda Vincent and blues pickers Keb Mo, Guy Davis and Eric Bibb, as well as Americana-country types such as Rosie Flores... An impressive lineup, sure, but better still is the calibre of songwriting, and the actual kid friendliness of it all.  This is a really fun album!  Fun, as in, little kids might actually like it, and might even sing along if you played it for them.  Plenty of silly songs like "Bling-Blang," "Bananaphone" and "Bellybutton Song."  Some songs are perky, like "Red, Red Robin"; others are instructive, like "Man Named All The Animals," and others still model assertiveness and communication skills, like Taj Mahal's excellent "Don't You Push Me Down," in which various kids stick up for themselves in unpleasant situations.  I like this album a lot, and plan to play it for my kid for years to come+music
I love you Danielle, love Garry+P+You are great on this one Danielle, I love and miss you so much. I wish it was 1982 and you were still on Archie Bunkers Place. You poor thing, I'll be your main reviewer from now on. Why are you hiding that great voice and acting talent in New York. I would love to put you to work for Mirror Vision Inc. Records in Morro Bay CA. I plan to see you in concert soon and hope you are having a good fall. I think of you often and always mention your bright star to other people, I wish I could think of you more, you have never met me, and I know we have become distant, but you are still the mystery of my life, say hello to your dad and mom for me, and I miss you from Morro Bay CAlifornia,(i love you babe) love garr+music
The Jacksons: Re-Invented, or Re-Controlled?+P+In 1975, Joe Jackson was tired of Motown Records controlling his childrens' careers. So he moved them over to Epic Records. The newly Christened "Jacksons" had to prove themselves to not only CBS Records, but to the world that they could produce, write, and perform their own records with plausible credibility.So instead of being controlled by Henry Cosby, Hal Davis, and to a lesser extent, Berry Gordy at Motown, their direction was handed over by Epic to Philidelphia Phunk-Meisters Kenneth Gamble, and Leon Huff. They had a tremendous string of success, with Teddy Pendergrass, MFSB, Harold Melvin, and The Blue Notes, and McFadden and Whitehead to name just a few.  They took the Jacksons' original songs, brought them into the studio, worked their Philly majik, and out came one of the greatest Soul records ever cut on wax. From Start to finish, "The Jacksons" takes you from one Phunkified Phunk Phest top the next, starting with "Enjoy Yourself" and Culminating in the Phunkadelic "Style Of Life". When I was a child I heard this record, and originally thought that "Good Times" was the Jackson's remake of the theme from that TV show. But it was pure slow Phunk. Phunk-da-fied-, Phunkalicious, or just just plain Phantastic, The Jackson's Epic Debut is Phat+music
One of his best+P+I am 68 and a long time Stewart fan, this is one of his best.  Don't know what the problem is with the other reviewers+music
New Wave Dance Classic: A Must Have+P+What would have happened if Ian Curtis had not pulled the plug on his own life?  It is a hard question to ask since I am a very devoted Joy Division Fan but I also am a good fan of New Order.  I have to say that I imagine Joy Division might have recorded one ore two more albums  and broken up: New Order may have never been.  So while it is tragic that Curtis committed suicide it gave the way for the rest of Joy Division the license to effectively reinvent themselves as New Order.  The band is very Different from JD but in "Power, Corruption Lies" , New Order's first, we hear a hint of JD with a burst of new creativity that must have been the results of a painful and cathartic period.    The music on this album is more heavily Synth and Drum based than any of the JD material though maybe not as much as later New Order work.  By 1983 synths and drum machines were just coming into their own and this year saw the invention of the MIDI interface for synths etc. It was also a time when the new wave movement was finally getting solidified.  All history aside, the album is great: it is upbeat, full of poppy dance tracks and a real new wave classic.  If you are buying the album just for "Blue Monday" (a track so good even a horrible band like Orgy could make a hit out of it) you are in for a real surprise. You will find many of the other tracks to be great as well.  "Age of Consent" is among my other favorites.  This is another great track for dancing.  Also "the Village"  is a great track as well.  If you are going to buy two New Order albums get this one and Substance.  Although they share a few tracks they are both great.  I find that this album get far more play though.  This is a must have for the New Order fan of course.  But also fans of new wave/'80's music and Joy Division fans alike should also buy this one.  This album has received so much acclaim and has been so influential in its 20-year life span that it should be a must have for any modern music fan.  I highly recommend it!  -- Ted Murena   +music
FUN!+P+This CD is great for the entire family. The songs are catchy and it's not a big deal if you're caught singing them around strangers!+music
I wanted so badly to like this.+N+I really couldn't wait to get this CD.  I wanted so badly to like it.  But - it is just too bluegrassy for me.  Every single song.  It would be great one or two songs, but every song gets old.  Plus, the recording quality doesn't seem that great.  You can barely hear the words, and most kids want to sing along.  Jenny Jenkins is a fun song, and Shenendoah is hauntingly beautiful, but For the Kids and NO! are way better CD's+music
Great Debut Album+P+I enjoy the album still to this day. All the songs are good, but I listen a couple of songs more than others such as Hold On, You don't have to worry, Don't Go.  This is a great album, which I don't planning on selling or trading anytime soon. +music
A Must+P+The Crusaders Sound Great on this Disc.The Music&amp;Arrangements work very well all the way thru.The Grooves&amp;Smoothness make this Recording very Complete.this Group has been Bad for so long+music
Edwin McCain = Amazing Music+P+If it has the name Edwin McCain on it, trust me its a great product to buy. The songs he writes are heart felt and true to every drop of ink used to write them with..+music
One step forward two steps back+N+Following on from the fantastic 'The Duel' Allison Moorer's latest release 'Getting Somewhere' is a massive, massive  disappointment. Quite simply the material on 'Getting Somewhere' is weak and gutless.  On the rare occasions Moorer tries to emulate the beauty and feel of 'The Duel' - such as on Hallelujah & New Years Day - Earle rips the heart out of the material with such an amateurish, pedestrian and thin production that you feel cheated ! Business and pleasure rarely mix and Moorer should take a long, hard look at this release and give serious consideration to re-installing RS Field next time around.  If Moorer wants a guitar groove that burns , drums that drive and vocals that mesmerise then Earle is simply not the man for the job.  Moorer is a fantastic talent who has one of the finest female voices of any genre (she can write a mean song too ! ) . This CD showcases none of her abilities and should be consigned to the bargain bins immediately+music
Neutral Milk Hotel Ripoff+N+I get the feeling that most of the reviews on here for this album are written by folks who feel special because they think they discovered some new amazing genre and sound that no one else knows about.  Hate to break it to you kids, but this sounds has been around since the mid 90s.  It was called Neutral Milk Hotel and it was vastly superior to these con-artists called the Decemberists.  Before you disagree with me, go pick up Neutral Milk hotel's In the Aeroplane over the Sea (1997), and then try to disagree+music
A gem that shines brighter with each listen+P+Carbon Leaf's sound continues to evolve, and the results are outstanding. The band says it has given up trying to "define" its style of music, since it's a shifting blend of so many influences and original ideas. In the past, Carbon Leaf has played variations of rootsy folk-rock with Celtic, bluegrass, and alt-pop flourishes. This new album is focused more on a clean but no less impressive, straightforward pop-rock sound that's catchy without being cloying, radio-friendly without being superficial. Even with this focus, there's excellent variety: "Block of Wood" has a gorgeous country-rock lilt, for example, while "International Airport" flirts with jazz. All in all, this is a polished gem that deserves to be the band's breakout album.  The songs range from engaging ("Bright Lights," "Love Loss Hope Repeat") to anthemic ("Learn to Fly," "Comfort") to heartbreaking ("Block of Wood") to humorous ("A Girl and Her Horse") to profound ("The War Was in Color"). If you enjoy infectious melodies, stunning harmonies, thought-provoking and often bittersweet lyrics, beautiful instrumentation, and pristine, finely crafted production, you will love this album.   There are acoustic rhythm guitars aplenty, neatly embellished with subtle electric guitar riffs and fills (Terry Clark and Carter Gravatt), anchored by a killer rhythm section (Jordan Medas on bass and Scott Milstead on drums) and some touches of mandolin (Gravatt again). This album also has a bit more keyboard work than some of Carbon Leaf's earlier releases, courtesy of guest musician Tim Lauer. Soaring above it all is the clear, resonant and at times hypnotic voice of lead singer Barry Privett, who also writes all of the band's lyrics.  This is my favorite release of 2006 so far, along with "Ganging Up on the Sun" by Guster. Both new and longtime fans of Carbon Leaf have much to celebrate with "Love, Loss, Hope, Repeat.+music
A Great Place to Start+P+One thing I love about greatest hits packages from groups with only one legitimate hit is that you never grow tired of them. Timbuk 3's greatest hits package is a good place to start enjoying their music and you will not  get tired of hearing songs you've heard a million times on the radio. If  you want more info on the band seach the web because there is a least one  great web site. After buying this CD and the live one you will have to  seach the used bins and I highly recommend the album Eden Alley+music
Better than the movie+P+This soundtrack is excellent. There is not a single song that I skip when listening to the cd.  The mix of recent and older songs sung by familiar and unfamiliar artists is great.  Anita Nalick, Breathe (2a.m.) is worth the price of the album.+music
Marvellous+P+I haven't bought an album for such a long time because who needs to spend the extra cash when there's online piracy? But I have to own this.  Feinstein's voice is so pure and versatile; he is funny at a moment and the next, he can be so heartbreakingly bittersweet. His performance is first class, and one has to consider that he can sing so well at a live concert.  +music
OK for kids, except maybe one song+P+I have maybe a hundred Christmas CDs (it's a hobby) but I think this is the only one with the "Explicit Lyrics" warning!  This is fore just for one song "Here Comes Fatty Claus" which featured a fairly prominent use of the "sh*t" word.  I have a fairly young child and burnt a copy of the CD without that song. She loves it!  As for the CD... it's pretty good. Waters has managed to collect the best of campy Christmas songs, something unique as far as I'm aware.    But it's not just a novelty CD... the songs are good. This isn't intentional camp... it is sincere stuff with MAYBE the exception of the Tiny Time song. (One of my daughter's favorite, because it's well done.+music
More horrible rap...+N+As if Fiddy Cent wasn't enough to make me break some bones, this horrible trend of Kayne West comes in. What is there to be said that hasn't been said? Nothing, really; my work has been done by all the one-star reviewers. All I have to say is that I hope this rapper fades away from the universe sooner or later.  Want good rap? Go for Tupac (R.I.P.) or Public Enemy+music
Thanks, but no thanks.+N+Most people considered this the Cheap Trick &quot;comeback&quot; album.  Sixteen years after the fact I'm forced to admit that it ranks as more of a &quot;go-back&quot; album instead.  While Cheap Trick didn't set the music world on fire with most of their 80's releases, it wasn't until the rot set in on the unbelievably sub-par release &quot;The Doctor&quot; that I actively had to search for something good to say about one of their albums.  On &quot;The Doctor&quot; I searched but came up empty.  &quot;Lap Of Luxury&quot; isn't quite that bad, but it set a bad tone for the releases to follow.  I've made dozens of Cheap Trick compilations over the years and &quot;Let Go&quot; was the only song that I included off of LOL.  The thing that consistently irritated me with each subsequent release in the 80's and early 90's was the press release that was issued saying how this was the album that took the Trick back to their rockin' roots.  Well let me tell ya, this is far from it.  I know.  I remember+music
We all love this one!+P+Dan Zanes is great! My husband and I both enjoy listening to this as well as our 20 month old. Most of the other music CD's that we have for our son I find a little irritating after a bit of listening. Rocket Ship Beach is fun, family music! I highly recommend this to all ages+music
Mythology As A Solution????????????????+N+Wow!!! This is a horrible album. I really enjoyed Comin' From Where I'm From, so I expected good things from this one right here. Wrong. On the title track Anthony Hamilton comes with some potentially positive socially-conscience lyrics, then he starts talking about praying. Of course mythological-minded cult people aren't worried, they think mythical magical people will come out of the sky and fix everything if they just stay on their knees. The four subsequent songs are full on Jesus songs. People want warning labels for albums they deem to be offensive for whatever reason, but they need some kind of cult warning. I would not have purchased this CD had I known it was on some cult mess. In "Preacher's Daughter" he even says "A preacher's daugher so she had common sense." I'm not sure if that's supposed to be a joke, but common sense should tell one magic people don't live in the clouds. Then "Pass Me Over" reminds me of the that two-part skit on Ice Cube's Lethal Injection where the cat is just sitting there waiting for Jesus and gives Ice Cube all his stuff, 'cause he thinks Jesus will give him new stuff. But Anthony Hamilton tries to make it sound like a positive thing to just sit there and wait for mythology to become reality. If people think this type of behavior is a real solution to one's personal problems or the worlds problems then I, for one, am very worried about our future, or probable complete lack there of. That's a very dangerous mind state. "Sista Big Bones" is a good song, but it's not worth purchasing this+music
Incredible Mimick+P+Bubble from Ab Fab sounds exactly like Marilyn Monroe, Billie Holiday, Judy Garland and others.  What a talent.  She needs her own Las Vegas Show.  She would be beyond great!  +music
REALLY GOOD STUFF! +P+Lots and lots of positive and negative reviews about this record in a comparison sense to their previous work it seems. Honestly, I didn't know of any personnel changes to and/or from the band prior to listening to it three times through. Evanescence is the real deal. Enjoy! Five Stars.+music
'Taking me far...far as a rental car can go' Beck rules!!+P+I'm one of those people who didn't really *know* anything about Beck.  Oh sure I knew his hits - "Loser", "Where It's At", "The New Pollution" et al.  Just never really thought much about the guy.  Until...about three months ago when I downloaded a couple tracks from this album from Napster2Go..."E Pro" and "Girl".  After giving them a few listens I downloaded the entire Guero album not long thereafter.  I don't know what to say that hasn't already been said by a lot of others here- it's been voted one of the Best of 2005 for a REASON.  This is an AWESOME album.  During a looong road trip I played some of the tracks for my Better Half and he gradually got addicted...starting with "Earthquake Weather".  Now it's not only this album but pretty much the entire Beck catalog for the two of us :) Even the songs I started out being "meh" about grew on me (and hubby) BIG TIME.  Just a great album...musicianship is spot on, and Beck definitely has a strong sense of humor mixed with a healthy dose of irony!  The tracks which are STANDOUTS (at least in our opinion) are E-Pro (great kick start to the album); Que Onda' Guero (LOVE the lowrider horns throughout, along with the "Hey! Guero!" random shouts); Girl (catchy...this should have been a HUGE hit...); Earthquake Weather (haunting melody, great riff!), Hell Yes (hai!); and I really love Rental Car...just a cute little song - way too short...also catchy riff and verses!  DO check this album out.  Absolutely a gem+music
wonderful stuff..+P+"Alt-country" would indeed be a limiting description,none-the-less an accurate point of reference,as this artist is obviously drawing from past Country musicians.But make no mistake,this is not a tired retread thru the same-old same-old but rather an exceptional modern piece of music.I'm usually more inclined towards the Heavy than the twangy,but this is just so well written and catchy with a distinct melancholic cloud hanging over the proceedings,and this woman can SING.One of the few recent musicians that deserve that designation+music
Good tunes just keep on coming from OCMS+P+After the profound impact of the David Rawlings produced "O.C.M.S.," to my music collection, my pre-order of "Big Iron World" came with pretty high expectations. I've listened to it three times since receiving it in the mail last night and though it doesn't sport tracks with the immediate staying power of "Wagon Wheel," "Big Iron World" does pull some wonderfully surprising punches. Though he doesn't capture OCMS's live act at it's fullest (and who really could), Rawlings' production once again manages to maintain OCMS's authenticity and pushes their "old-time" music into the modern area, without a hint of the tacky, over-produced, artificial, gimmicks, heard on other neo-bluegrass records.   "Big Iron World" is not an album stuck in history, or looking to bite of the accomplishments of the past. With "Big Iron World," OCMS once again displays its own sound, pushing the limits of bluegrass/county/rock/punk/folk forward, while paying its respect and harkening back to the fables of Woody Guthrie, the picking of Muleskinner and the late 60's albums of Dylan. Moreover, the songs of "Big Iron World" comprise a complete body of work. The pro-union, "Union Maid" and folksy "James River Blues" are the standout tracks on an album that works as a whole, with each song complementing the next. As with all of OCMS's albums, "Big Iron World" is a breath of fresh air in comparison to most other albums put out by artists of a similar age.  They have put together a great collection of songs to be enjoyed by fans of numerous genres.+music
my favorite JB cd of all time...+P+by far, Picture This, is my favorite cd from the JB collection...have three copies...one for the home, one for the car, and another he personally signed for me at one of his concerts! Been a fan of his since he appeared on tv talk show back in late 1997...despite our daily hectic schedules, his music always brings us back to a place that is calm, relaxing & peaceful...now that we have small children, they are even accustomed to listening his music, which makes bedtime even sweeter! :)+music
E-40 - My Ghetto Report Card+N+You got to be kidding me right? People actually giving this album 5 stars. Wow people are so blind it isn't even funny. This is all commercialized garbage. E-40 is all on this "hyphy" tip now, lmao how wack is that. Hyphy is straight wack, the lyrics have no concept what so ever. All pointless.  Production, well yea all these commercialized albums got production, like this album. But then again where are the lyrics?   This is one of those albums where you sit there and like it ONLY because of the beat/hook lol. People that listen to this type of music dont like real Hip-Hop, as I said theyre blind. People that arent big Hip-Hop fans, I dont criticize you for listening, but all you people that claim to be Hip-Hop fans, f*** outta here, you aint.   This album is for commercial rap listeners only, if you like underground STAY away from this at all costs. Pick up some real HipHop instead.  Peace. +music
Much overrated+N+When I first bought this cd I really liked it, but unlike most other cd's it sounded worse with time. After 2-3 months it was just sitting in my drawer and I found myself skipping stations on the radio when they played the Killers. After seeing them live at the Virgin Festival this weekend I know they are totally phony, not only is their cd bland but they are the worst live band ever.

Enjoy this tasty acoustic treat... It's HOT!!+P+When I make a long night drive home after a loud concert,      I like to listen to something quiet and soothing.  THE PIZZA TAPES is one of my favorite quiet and soothing picks, it's a sweet masterpiece of acoustic jamming and inspired playing.  During two days in February of 1993 Garcia, Grisman and Rice got together to fiddle around with some tunes and see how they came out on tape.  As we all know, the recordings were stolen by the infamous "Pizza boy" and soon they became property of the formidable Grateful Dead tape and CD trading community.  Several years later Grisman remastered the recordings and put out the best takes on this album.  This isn't an album of electric jams, it's rather impromptu, quiet and easygoing.  Some people might dismiss it as "background music."  However if you take a closer listen, the trio handles the traditional tunes and Bob Dylan tunes and the Gershwin (!) tunes with such skill, there's hardly an uninspired or false note anywhere to be found.  Garcia screws up here and there but even those mistakes are a pleasure to listen to.  Definitely a classic album and something I received with anticipation.  I still enjoy putting this on and it gets better with successive listenings.  By the way, I love the cover art... the CD case is made to resemble a pizza box.  Open it up and the disc is a pizza pie with all the toppings.  On the back is a menu of all the treats including some spicy items (choice words from Garcia!)  I actually get the craving for pizza when I'm listening to the album.  The PIZZA TAPES sure is one tasty album. Great music and great pizza, what a winning combination!+music
Woke Up (?) With A Monster Bomb...but at least it's not a bad as In Colour (or was it black and white) or Busted!+N+Pls. Rick Nielsen, "Tell Me Everything"! Why did  you guys get a sorry Producer like Ted Templeman  to Produce what could have been a great comeback  LP? If you Trick fans wanna be in 'My Gang' then  you gotta spread the news to pray for better ef- forts than this in the future if the Tricksters  are gonna stay employed!  'You're All I Wanna Do' and the title track, with it's "Mommy and Daddy" chorus, is kinda  cool and retro for 'Surrender' - now the mar- riage is on the rocks! Like Cheap Trick's ca- reer after this disgrace! It's enough to make  you 'Cry Baby'...Pls. bring back Brant!+music
An Embarrasment to Reggae+N+I bought this disk on the strength of the reviews here at Amazon.  What a major disappointment this disk is.  Embarrasingly amateur, with keyboard loop drums and keyboard basses, it is difficult to believe that these are well-known professional reggae singers as well.  Another case of &quot;dumbing-down&quot; music for children, something definitely not required to fully engage kids with music (the outstanding Putamayo series for example is presented no frills, no dumbing-down).  Good &quot;children's music&quot; inspires both parents and kids, and kids react positively to that in their parents. A shame to pay $... for this disk+music
FOOD AND LIQUOR IS AN CLASSIC HANDS DOWN!!!!!+P+I MUST SAY THAT WHEN I FIRST HEARD "KICK PUSH" I THOUGHT TO MYSELF THAT THIS GUY REALLY HAD SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT BECAUSE HE IS SUCH A METAPHORIC RHYMER AND HIS DELIVERY IS VERY STRONG SO I KNOW I HAD TO BUY LUPE FIASCO'S DEBUT ALBUM "FOOD AND LIQUOR". AFTER LISTENING TO THIS ALBUM FROM BEGINNING TO END I WAS NOT AT ALL DISAPPOINTED BUT INDEED THIS ALBUM REALLY LET ME KNOW THAT THERE ARE STILL A FEW RAPPERS OUT THERE THAT ARE STILL KICKING RHYMES ABOUT ISSUES THAT WE DEAL WITH IN EVERYDAY LIFE INSTEAD OF HEARING THESE OTHER MC'S THAT DONT RAP ABOUT ANYTHING EXCEPT CARS, CLOTHES, JEWELRY, AND WOMEN. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM TO ANYONE THAT IS A FAN OF REAL RAP BECAUSE THIS ALBUM WILL OPEN YOUR EYES TO ALOT OF THINGS IN LIFE.  MY 5 FAVORITE TRACKS ARE: 1."THE COOL"- THIS SONG IS BASICALLY ABOUT A YOUNG MAN WHO HAD DIED(NOT LITERALLY) BUT HE WAS ABLE TO COME BACK TO LIFE AND TRY TO MAKE A CHANGE FOR THE BETTER BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE CHOSE TO LIVE HIS LIFE THE SAME WAY HE HAD LIVED IT ONCE BEFORE. SONG IS VERY METAPHOR AND DEEP. 2."HE SAY SHE SAY"- THIS SONG IS ABOUT A LITTLE BOY WHO DOESNT HAVE A VISIBLE FATHER AND IT IS AFFECTING HIM DEEPLY. 3."HURT ME SOUL"- THIS SONG TALKS JUST ABOUT ANY ISSUE YOU CAN THINK OF FROM WOMEN BEING DEGRADED IN RAP MUSIC, DRUG DEALING, CROOKED COPS, GOVERNMENT NOT OFFERING BLACK PEOPLE WELFARE AND OVERCHARGING HEALTHCARE, JOHNS AND PROSTITUTES. SONG ALSO HAS A VERY NICE HOOK. 4."SUNSHINE"- THIS SONG IS ABOUT THIS GIRL THAT HE FALLS IN LOVE WITH IN A CLUB EVENTHOUGH HE'S NOT LOOKING FOR LOVE HE CANNOT RESIST IT WITH THIS GIRL. 5."PRESSURE" FEATURING JAY-Z- VERY NICE CONCEPT TO IT FROM LUPE'S STANDPOINT AND EVENTHOUGH IM NOT A BIG JAY-Z FAN HE STILL PUT DOWN A NICE VERSE.  OTHER SONGS I LIKE ARE "JUST MIGHT BE OK", "DAYDREAMININ", "KICK PUSH", "I GOTCHA","INSTRUMENTAL", AND "AMERICAN TERRORISTS".  I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM TO ANYONE WHO IS A TRUE FAN OF REAL RAP BECAUSE IT WILL NOT DISAPPOINT YOU AT ALL!!!!+music
His best yet+P+I can't rate this one highly enough. It's certainly in a vein with his last couple, but, as has been oft noted, it's more political and full of social commentary. Some people will like it a little less than the two preceding ones, as a result. I expected to have that reaction, but I found the socially conscious elements surprisingly compelling after all, and Rodney melds them well with his more personal insights, which ultimately predominate in the end. Also, focusing on the social commentary can obscure the fact that a good number of these songs are just a lot of fun, like a slightly angrier and more introspective version of the wonderful stuff he did with the Notorious Cherry Bombs.  By the way, if you like this album, you may want to pick up the book "Rednecks & Bluenecks: The Politics of Country Music." It's not just about the country you hear on the radio but also alternative country and Americana. And Rodney shows up prominently throughout the book; there's a whole section just about this album+music
Oh, Lord...+N+I was looking at the Billboard Hot 100 last year like I do every week, and at one point I noticed a song that was making moves was "Grind With Me" by Pretty Ricky. I had never heard of the song, and after I listened to it, I wished I still hadn't heard of the song. I don't know what possessed me to listen to the full-length album, Bluestars, but I did and, well, I couldn't get the CD out of my stereo fast enough.  I agree with reviewer Hakeem when he said that all these five-star reviews must be from people that are on the group's street team or something. Pretty Ricky consists of four people: three rappers (Spectacular, Diamond "Baby Blue", and Slick -- and I use the term "rapper" loosely) and one singer (Pleasure). The problem with this album is that these are the horniest AND most talentless guys I have ever heard of, and that is a terrible combination. The lead single "Grind With Me" is really called "Grind On Me", and it's one of the nastiest things I have ever heard, but "Playhouse" isn't far behind. And "Nothing But a Number" is very, very statutory.  Also annoying is their use of dated lyrics, like "If lovin' you is wrong, I don't wanna be right" on "Grind On Me", or "If I'm lyin', I'm flyin'" on "Grill `Em" (what does that even mean, anyway?). The guys also have a habit of continually yelling certain adlibs, like "FROM THE BACK!" on "Get a Little Closer", and "Yes, sir!" on "Your Body". Also, while Pleasure's singing isn't HORRIBLE, it's hard to listen to after all that wack rapping. Actually, his chorus on "Shorty Be Mine" is sure to cause you DISpleasure.  Speaking of that song, things are equally unimpressive when the guys DON'T talk about sex, like on "Never Let You Go", "Can't Live Without You", and the obligatory bling-blingin' songs "Chevy" and "Grill `Em". But in the long run I guess all that doesn't matter because nobody cares about Pretty Ricky any more and as my brother said, they're probably now back to working at Wendy's. If I ever come across the Bluestars CD again, in the words of "Your Body", dammit, I'll beat it up.  Anthony Ruper+music
incredible ...  worthy of more than 5 stars+P+Wow...what a great collection of songs, a wonderful album. I am a fan of the Church, but even if you have never heard of them, you will find this disc amazing. I am at a loss of words to decribe the songs. My only regret is that there is not a DVD of performances of these songs. I would go upstairs and watch it all night+music
Incredible Soundtrack+P+Really well done. This is an extremely well crafted CD. Six Days is probably the best song on here.  Note: The song when they're waiting for bow wow's car is       Ooh Aah - Grit+music
CD not compatible with car CD player. +N+I was unable to play in my car CD player, so only choice I got is to listen at home using my home DVD player.+music
John Fogerty Premonition Is The Best DVD To Own A Dream Come True+N+I have listened to this cd, also watched the dvd, of John Fogerty's long road home on amazon. Nothing can compare to his Dvd of Premonition.I own It love it, Put it on and  makes me  rock out, With one of the best entertainers In his prime time of life.The guitars and Instruments he plays is awesome to watch a legend of great talent.His voice Is so excellent & clear.Had some friends over with John's Premonition dvd playing.It took all of us back to that time In history.They all went to amazon and bought Premonition.I know soon they will all be gone.I went back to buy one more the price is so reasonable.As I consider Premonition to be a Collector's dvd.If you see it again.Do not wait buy it while they are available. I know its a Import as most dvds are today.Mine plays excellent In audio and picture.You feel like you are sitting in the audience with John performing.Give Premonition 10 Stars.Anything after John's Premonition dvd can not compare to it.No matter how hard they try to bring back his music on a Cd or a dvd.Premonition Is the best dvd  of all of times. All the rest get 1 Star for trying. Though not coming close to what I call  my Collector's Edition  dvd of John Fogerty's Prmonition. +music
Chopin or Lang Lang?+N+Just listening to few extracts of Chopin Sonata on Amazon.com made it clear to me - I don't want to hear the rest. Let's take the Scherzo (2nd movement), for example. Lang Lang plays the middle episode not just "a little slow" but at least twice as slow. Whereas if you look in the score you'll see a strikingly different picture - Chopin (the composer!) asked for no tempo change, he never canceled Molto Vivace. Unfortunately, it is very common when a performer changes things here and there, so it sounds so called original and "deep", rather then trying to read attentively the composer's code, understand and make sense of it. I trust Chopin's genius and never those who put their ego above the existing Beauty.     +music
Hello people this is a mixtape not an album!+N+I dont see how anybody can call this an album. This is a mixtape. Lil Wayne basically freestyled through the whole album! The beats are bland and only a few of Wayne's freestyles are tight. Standout freestyles: THE MOBB, MONEY ON MY MIND, FIREMAN, OH NO, HIT EM'UP and IM A DBOY. Filler freestyles: shooter, receipt, grown man, feel me, hustler music, mo fire etc. lock and load is a boring track and Kurupt is whispering in the hook (WTF!). Its obvious that he was trying to get an up north fanbase to buy this s---. The majority of reviewers who gave him five stars come from up north. Lil Wayne's best albums are LIGHTS OUT AND THE CARTER. Lil Wayne at his worst: THE BLOCK IS HOT, 500 DEGREES and THE CARTER 2.+music
so let down+N+I normally don't write reviews that are negative on amazon because they usually get nothing but negative feedback/unhelpful votes or whatever. So I shall try to be as fair as possible. I got Leonard Cohen's compilation "i'm your man" and there is this amazing, incredible rendition of "if it be your will" that Antony does. It was my favorite track on this record and the whole Leonard Cohen tribute concert in general, 'come so far for beauty' is really good. "If It be your will" was performed with such a soulful voice and i loved how it built inself until the end with the background vocals wailing and him stating the title words over and over. So I went to the library and waited a month to borrow this debut record by Antony; it was always checked out or on reserve. Yes, it was the same voice, and yes, I will say, Antony does have a very interesting and even somewhat beautiful voice. The album's sleeve put me off at first (and continued to do so). I am someone who often puts music together with its cover art (check out This Mortal Coil's 'song to the siren' with that perfect 23 envelope sleeve, for example). So I listened to this album a few times and was put off by the silly lyrics that actually made me grimace and cringe. "mr muscles forcing bursting stingy little thingy into me . . ." or "i am so very happy, so please hit me" or "river of sorrow, don't swallow" or the breathy way he says the word "twilight" don't know, it just made a little uncomfortable. So it seemed I didn't like the record.   Then I read an article in INTERVIEW magazine with Elton John about new music in 2005, he was praising Antony's second record. So I gave it another try and after three songs, couldn't handle it anymore. The images of the cd and the things he sings about or his presentation of the words ruin it. Maybe if he just sang songs by poets like Leonard Cohen it would be better? In the Elton John article, he said Antony sings a lot about sexuality, which I gathered from the lyrics, and but he presents his sexuality in such a pathetic way that almost says "if you don't like me, or if you are not drawn to this sad life I am presenting to you, it's because you don't like gay/transgendered people". In my case, that couldn't be further from the truth. I would not recommend this record to anyone, but when I mention it to people, I can't help but say how much I loved "if it be your will" and how disappointed I was in his solo effort.+music
eh, so so+N+Sounds just like the last record if you ask me.  Always has a great band, arrangements, and mixing, but Bob's still trying to paint the picture of natural disasters, old cars, the dustbowl, Annie, Frannie, Sarah, Ruth and whatever other old timey nonsense he can come up with.  God bless him+music
The worst of all Tosca+N+I don't care what others stated...Sabata rushed the opera to fit the LP capability, Maria screamed at all times, no pianissimis, and everyone was super high charged like they must finish the recording on time to fit the album.  Best Tosca is Maria Callas with Pretre recording.  Don't buy this mono recording.  Maria did not understand who Tosca was during this moment+music
Uh, yeah....+N+Aside from having what is possibly the most laughably awful name for a band I've ever heard, these guys just really don't do it for me.  A lot of the music is fairly decent, but the singer is just incredibly annoying.  Now, I am certainly not a stickler on vocal perfection, but this dude is really bad.  I've heard drunk guys in karaoke bars that I'd rather listen to.    But like I said, the band overall isn't completely terrible.  They're decent musicians, and I like a lot of the music, but I just really cannot get around that singer.  Ordinarily, it's not a good idea to judge a band by their name, but um...this isn't one of those times+music
overrated+N+perhaps it's a bit unfair because lucinda engenders such high expectations, but i was really disappointed with this record the songwriting is weak, the singing is weak, and the arrangements are dull  something kicked all the life out of the music--the songs are not all the same, but for some reason they all sound the same--and embarrassingly, you can sing most of them after one listen, they are so simplistic and cliched+music
This is an entertaining new CD from Amos Lee+P+I love this new CD from Amos Lee.    The first single is entitled Shout Out Loud.  This song really puts me in a great mood.  His guitar playing is so energetic here.  My favorite track is Long Line Of Pain though.  It is a beautiful song about personal loss and loneliness. Sympathize is an another highlight on this disc.  Amos Lee's subtle voice is filled with compassion for people who are down on their luck.  Southern Girl is Amos' tribute to the  charm of a girl from the south.  Night Train is a very pretty love song. Skipping Stone is a bluesy sounding song about trying to move on after the loss of a loved one.  Freedom is an interesting track.  It is a reminder that the pursuit of  freedom should not lead to violence.  The lyrics of this song are true and thought provoking. Sweet Pea is a simple and sweet song about coming home to someone special.  Careless is an excellent song about the betrayal of a friend.  I love the feeling of loss and sense of  hurt in Amos' voice on this track.   Supply and Demand is a very entertaining CD by a talented young musician and song writer+music
I Can't Take It!+N+I got these CDs based on some reviews, but I can not take the singing.  There are far too many little kids singing, and the adults are no better.  It is WAY too gimmicky.  If you want just traditional songs sung nicely, this is not the set for you!  I am going to copy the songs I like and make my own CD - I think there are maybe 2 songs per CD I'll use!  BAD+music
Another home run +P+Once again, Audra McDonald proves that she's the best musical theatre singer since Streisand. While many fans might quibble with her selections (mostly covers of rock and pop songs), her voice and her intepretations are seocnd to none+music
Number Ones-The Bee Gees+N+Although I'm a great fan of the brothers work, I feel this album an insult to the serious Bee Gees collector.  The tracks here are not rare, new or even unavailable.  Time for Barry & Robin to get back in there and give their army of fans a treat instead of another compilation rip-off.  Even Robin's latest redition "A Live CD" whoooooopie doo, again songs of old hat.....I'm hungry for new material not oldies.  And please don't get me wrong, it broke my heart when Maurice died, my world stopped and I do sympathise with Barry, Robin and the rest of their family.  Being a fan for 30 something years I've loved their music since the beginning and will carry on doing so for years to come....But please some new songs are needed from the brothers.  So come on Barry get together with Robin and show us the great writing talent you still have.  A devoted listener talisman, Dundee +music
The worst CD in History!+N+The Black Eyed Peas are the WORST group is rap HISTORY! Its hard to believe that anyone could make music worse than the Black Eyed Peas. This group is an embarasment to Rap, Hip-Hop, R&B, and any other type of music ever created. How and why people continue to support these lame, extremely non-talented rejects of the rap world is completely unbelievable. I thought thier last CD was trash, but this has incredibly surpassed the low mark set by Elephunk, which should have been called, "Hey let'sell out and attempt to create the worst music ever known to man". The only good news is that theyll soon be forgotten about as they have just murdered thier musical careers, and will have to resort to doing jingles for commmercials in order to survive. These three unoriginal, talentless, boring, annoying, sellout, fake wanna-bes should stop making ANY kind of music and get completely out of the music business. Tonight I willl pray very hard that these bafoons of the music industry NEVER make another song EVER!!!! To say that they SUCK would be a compliment, they would have to practice constantly for the next 1,000 years THEN make a deal with the devil just to scrape up enough talent to suck! Theyre just that HORRIBLE!!+music
One thing is predictable: this is lame!+N+Jamie Foxx might be best known as a mediocre actor (with one good performance as "Ray.").  But now he can best known now as a mediocre singer/writer.  While he has a good voice, he's either corny or has no hooks.  Basically, there is no substance but he figures he can capitalize after the movie "Ray."  And to anyone who says that he can write good songs, let's look at a song and see his wonderful poetic lyrics:   Yo you sleep  Naw I just um, I think I want some more  Yea I know we just got through  But its just so good, I just caint help it tho'  Its something about your body  Naw it aint all I think about  Well to be honest, oh   Im startin' to believe,  Something's wrong wit me,  Cause everyday, every night, every hour, every minute  I'm thinkin' `bout it  I can be at my job, in my car, up in church  And when I try to pray it off, it won't work  It seems that I caint get enough of   [Chorus:]  (Sex) All the time  (Sex) On my mind  (Sex) Everywhere I go  (Sex) I'm tryna let you know  (Sex) It's stronger than any drug even love  S-E-X ohhheee  (Sex) Can make you crazy  (Sex) Can make a baby  (Sex) All night long  (Sex) It's the perfect song  (Sex) Stronger than any drug even love  S-E-X oh   Its getting to the point where I (where I)  I watch it on TV when I buy DVDs  Thirty-nine ninety-nine for the new releases (39.99 for the new releases)  I aint proud of it, cause it's getting in the way of love for me  And I caint help it, caint shake it  (You know what) Sometimes I hear it calling me   [Chorus:]  (Sex) All the time  (Sex) On my mind  (Sex) Everywhere I go  (Sex) I'm tryna let you know  (Sex) It's stronger than any drug even love  S-E-X ohhheee  (Sex) Can make you crazy  (Sex) Can make a baby  (Sex) All night long  (Sex) It's the perfect song  (Sex) Stronger than any drug even love  S-E-X oh   Some call it bad, some call it good  Some do it bourgeois, some do it hood  I do it hood (can I say that one more time) girl I do it hood ohh   Some like it slow, some like it fast  It don't matter the tempo long as it lasts  I make it last (can I say that one more time) girl I make it last ohh    -Wow, that's a big pile of garbage!  Lyrics like that should easily win him a Grammy.  Keep it up, Jamie! +music
3 or 4 good songs+N+There are 3 or 4 good songs on this CD. If you want to purchase it to make your own compilation for your kids they will love a few of them. Others are WAY to slow and boring for kids to get excited about. There are a couple of them that make no sense at all on a chilren's CD. It seems like they couldn't decide whether to make a CD to put kids to sleep or to pep them up so they did both on one CD. That doesn't work for my kids. John Lithgow "Singin in the Bathtub" is a MUCH better choice. The songs are upbeat and lively. My kids ask for that one all the time+music
Breathtaking Simplicity...+P+Like all of Antony's Music, this EP has a chilling and superhuman quality to it. Unlike his other stuff, the production is toned down on the non-album tracks ("The Lake" and "The Horror Is Gone") to a stark, white-faced beauty that for me defines the core of Antony & The Johnsons. The album track, "Fistful of Love", is one of my favourite Antony songs, a soulful and grooving lament that makes a convincing argument for masochism as an uplifting and redemptive fetish.  Though the price is a bit steep, this is a great addition to any Antony fan's library+music
In His Element...+P+I am not a CLAY-MATE... howver, Clay Aiken is without-a-doubt the best runner-up from any season of AI.  That being said...I still wasn't sure if I would like this CD.  And I didn't---at first.  But then, after hearing it a few more times, I actually grew to like most of the songs.  Not all of them, which is why I didn't give him 5 stars, but it is a very good album.  My favorite happens to be the title track.  But, there are several more good songs on the CD.  Whether or not you are into this style of music, you can't argue that Clay Aiken has one of the best male voices around.  Probably the best male voice of his age.  I would recommend this CD to any one who is into Adult Contemporary.  Of course, if you are a Clay-mate, then I don't have to tell you anything :+music
Jimmy: Please Stick with the Postal Service!+N+As a big fan of the Postal Service (their "Give Up" easily makes the cut on my top 10 albums), I had high expectations for this Dntel record, as Jimmy Tamberello is one half of the Postal Service. BIG mistake. Listen to the samples: if you like what you hear, then buy it; if you don't like what you hear, don't make my mistake of thinking that the songs get better beyond the 30 seconds given. Worthwhile songs on this CD: 1)"(This Is) The Dream of Evan and Chan" (The Postal Service remix is available on iTunes, and is a better version than what's on the CD), sung by Ben Gibbard of Death Cab and Postal Service. 2)"Last Songs" is if anything, relaxing. I recommend getting these two songs on iTunes and leaving it at that, save some money.  The CD's too expensive for two decent songs.  Jimmy Tamberello has another digital project that he works called Figurine and (more recently) James Figurine, it's essentially a catchier, poppier version of Dntel, more in line with Postal Service+music
Not your father's Paul Simon album.+P+This is a very different sounding Paul Simon album.  The influence of Brian Eno is obvious and at times over-the-top.  My conclusion, now that I've had this album for a while, is that it's not one that I'm constantly listening to but, when I'm in the mood, this is really an interesting and fun album.  Occasionally, Paul reaches heights I don't feel he's reached since Graceland.  There are some great songs on here.  If you're looking for "Still Crazy after all these years" or "50 Ways to Leave Your Lover" - type songs, you're not going to find them here.  If you're interested in hearing Paul push the envelope, however, this is the one.  Paul hits the mark more often than he misses it on this one+music
Sometimes experiments are failures+N+I have always admired the experimental spirit in any artist. As a visual artist I am constantly trying new things in my work and every once in a while I stumble upon some new element or concept that withstands the "look at it a week from now and see how you feel" test. Other times I churn out pieces of junk which I spare the world from looking at. Animal Collective should have reconsidered releasing this often silly and pointless collection of sounds. It is an artistic experiment that failed. I hope this is only true about this particular disc (the only AC I have heard) as it would be a shame for someone to be consistently putting out pieces of artistic crap for any length of time and still be getting away with it.+music
They were labelled "creative" as children+N+I have decided to compose an album of mostly kindergarten children yelling about cats while someone opens and closes the door to a beginner's music class, and I will call it art.  People will write many reviews about the music, and they will say it is wonderful, and that it captures the essence of youth while retaining the wisdom of the ages.  They will do this because they are afraid to say that is stinks.  Music is not suppossed to hurt the ears.  To call this good music is an insult to good musicians.    I will give them credit for being brave enough to buy massive quantities of drugs from some dealer, for clearly they were higher than a kite, no, make that a weather ballon, when they composed the album.  Creative; maybe.  Listenable, enjoyable, humable, playable when company is over; no+music
Even for ALW, this is pretty bad+N+I'm going to start this off by saying that I am NOT the biggest Andrew Lloyd Webber fan.  Some of his works are amazing, like Joseph and various songs from each of his musicals, yet overall he tries to incorporate a very fake sounding pop opera into most of his shows.  Unfortunately, The Woman in White, his first try at gothic opera, is even worse. Webber obviously tried to pretend that the score for the musical was quality, thought-provoking work by jam-packing it with dissonant chords and loud orchestrations, but they only show how little he truly knows about music.  Half of the show's score is little short of random notes that seem to have no connection (almost as if he tried to imitate the genius of Sondheim).  The tunes are bland, the book is boring and confusing, and many of the performances are sub-par.  For instance, the actrees portraying the Woman in White simply shrieks throughout the entire CD.  Even when she sings, her screaming din hurts one's ears.  It seems as if she decided to cover the underdevelopment of her character with noise.  The other actors are generally adequite, yet they have so little to work with that their portrayals seem dull. Admittedly, there are some highlights to this CD, such as Crawford's amazing portrayal of Count Fosco (especially the live version of You Can Get Away With Anything...it is HILARIOUS!), but overall, the CD is hard to take in.  Some songs are quite beautiful, yet the track on which they resign are also full of shrieking, dull dialogue, and loud music.  I think it is a tell-tale sign of a flop when on a live-version CD of a musical, only one song is accompanied by reaction from the audience+music
Trash On Top of Garbage+N+Boy, and I thought "Cats" was bad. This is the single most boring, stupid, pointless and utterly awful piece of music garbage that has ever had the misfortune to befoul my ears. There is no story line, no range in music, no feeling, no lyrics to back up the awful music. I mean, the list could go on forever. I warn you, it's the biggest waste of $25.00 that you might, no, will ever spend. PLEASE, do yourself a favor and trust me. DON"T BUY THE CD!!! And if you do, when you put it on, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.You've been warned. Now please, spend your well earned money on something that actually has a purpose in life+music
Bad Company is good company+P+If you like this album, if you like the title track, it might inspire a few hard core fans to know that the original inspiration for both the name of the band, and especially the title track, is the masterpiece of a western, "Bad Company"- 1972.  The whole piano instrumental is practically lifted from the film's soundtrack, by "Fantasticks" Harvey Schmidt.  The song is a very haunting one which was a bit of an enigma for me until I saw the film itself.  It stars Barry Brown and Jeff Bridges.  It's worthwhile for not only western fans of every considerable imagination, but to fans of the band itself, to help make the song more meaningful, as it has for me!!  I highly recommend them both+music
Fantastic Captain and the Kid+P+I have held back from doing an online review because I recognize that my objectivity isn't well, very objective when it comes to Elton John.  I love everything he does (even "Victim of Love"!).  But I could no longer resist.  This CD is magnificent.  Elton John and Bernie Taupin have crafted a work that spans generations, bridges gaps and even pays homage to personal and artistic lapses over the years.  It is an honest, courageous and celebratory reflection of the terrain these two geniuses have traversed over some 37 years.  That's the depth of "The Captain and the Kid."  But let's not get lost in the depths here, either.  This CD is one great listen.  Even if you're not interested in the history...even if you're just a casual fan (can one just be a casual Elton John fan??)  or just like good music, "The Captain and the Kid" is great entertainment.  It has it all...great arrangements, great piano playing from Elton and of course, hooks abound.  No one...that's right, no one can write a hook like Elton.  These songs stay with you...they become your companions on YOUR journey, and like good wine, they get better and better.  I must also write a word of support for all who have written regarding so many artists doing retreads of old standards/hits.  I know, I know, this stuff is selling like there's no tomorrow.  I suppose, as much as I can't bear another Rod Stewart retread CD ( I loved Rod though most of his career...I just can't stand what he's done over the last five years...Rod...please STOP!) I guess the attraction/appeal of these CD's is that the buyer knows they're going to get a full CD's worth of good (or at least known) songs from a reliable artist.  True, it is not as easy as it used to be to find many CD's today that are original and good from start to finish...CD's tend to be longer than LP's and therefore run the risk of running out of steam, and let's face it...many do. Oh, the classic CD's, they're out there, you might have to do some mining before striking gold, however.  Sadly, "The Captain and the Kid" did not ignite the charts.  I cannot understand it. And I do realize that popularity has nothing to do with greatness. Yet, this IS truly a great CD, a work of art that deserves to be heard.  It is a throw back to the glory days, yet it is not dated in the least. And one listen...just one puts you right back on the yellow brick road, platform shoes and all! No, I suppose you can't go back...not totally anyway, but it is oh so nice take one more sweet ride with The Captain and the Kid. +music
Album Stinks+N+Hank III has done nothing but prove what a whiner he is by trashing other artists.  I have not heard one song on here that suggests any artistic ability.  This guy needs to clean up his mouth and worry about himself instead of trashing others+music
One or possibly two songs are good+N+Because I like faster music with a beat that makes me tap a foot, I only liked the cut "Lucky To Know You."  "Seeing Through You" is all right, too.  Perhaps Reynolds will independently release a CD of his own with more songs like "Lucky To Know You." +music
No Worries Here!+P+Be Human does not disappoint! It has sound quality mixed in with sound fx and acoustic and classical and when I say 4stars I mean it. When I say 5stars I usually mean a ten. Were I to do sound for a futuristic play I would feel gratified in using some of this. I think Yoko Kanno knows the Secret of Life and she shares her formula...with us, time-and-time again. I happened to be spoiled on her earlier works and always long for those type masterpieces; but if I had to choose american rhythm or Yoko Kanno, I would choose Yoko Kanno. I wonder if she's ever been nominated for a grammy? In my book she's world-class!As-I-said-before this cd does not disappoint and there are enough tracks on it to justify  four-stars. No worries here+music
Hip hop is a live and well!!!!!+P+This is one of my favorite releases from Common. This chi town warrior crafted an underground release that will bring a vibrant smile to the hardcore hip hop head and even awaken the minds of some of the fake commercial rap artist lovers. Songs like I used to love h.e.r and ressurection start the classic album and take you on the road to classic chicago hip hop. Not only the lyrics are dope but also the beats and the hooks. This is a pivotal album that needs to be in everyone's collectio+music
I thought he was a changed man.+N+This must be the record for quickest backslide I've ever seen.  He went from U Saved Me to a potty-mouthed melodramatic soap opera that has already gotten old. This all shows he wasn't sincere about his spirituality. All the praise and glorifying was just relief of being given a free pass for using the wrong thing as a urinal.  I admit I was intrigued and entertained with Trapped in the Closet; but the continuations are just getting more and more ridiculous. To continue to extend the installments until you eventually get to Chapter 100 (which seems to be his plan to hear him tell it) is unacceptable+music
wack+N+I have always liked R. Kelly's music.  When he produced "Trapped in the Closet", I thought it was a joke.  This is one of the stupidest, corniest, and blandest song I heard.+music
Juvi Needs His OWN Reality Check After Putting This Out!+N+Juvenile has been at the bottom and the top in his career.  He marinated on the underground until Cash Money exploded into the rap arena as well as mainstream radio in the mid-to-late 90s.  But then people got tired of hearing the same ole product that the label had to offer.  Even labelmates were getting sick of each other and the politics that was going down, leaving some to either depart or find other ways of getting their name out there.  B.G. went the independent route, holding on to a small fraction of the fans he had when he was a Hot Boy.  Turk followed suit, but soon found himself behind bars instead of spitting bars.  Juvenile found himself going the solo route, although he did briefly return in 2003 for Juve The Great.  Now with Atlantic, Juvi has some catching up to do with his newest release Reality Check.  "Get Your Hustle On" is the perfect track to start off the album because it shows that Juvenile knows what he needs to do to get ahead.  "I Know You Know" with Trey Songz is a good contender for the radio.  "Around The Way" is a song for the hood to know that he ain't never left and he doesn't plan to either.  "Sets Go Up" with Wacko is so-so, while his first single "Rodeo" is the millennium version of "Back That [...] Up" only with a more subdued approach.  Unfortunately the album takes a nosedive from there.  "What's Happenin'" is nothing to write home about, "Loose Booty" is another song devoted to the [...]-shaking community, and "Break A Brick Down" deliberately borrows a beat from another Cash Money track. "Who's Ya Daddy" is pointless, along with the annoying "Keep Talkin'" with Skip and Redd Eyezz and "Why Not."  Bun B makes another poor decision by collaborating on "Rock Like That."  The biggest shocker has to be "Addicted" with Brian McKnight making a dumb career move. Not only does Brian sing vulgar lyrics for the first time (and hopefully his last,) but Juvenile decides to talk his verses instead of rapping them (think Oran Juice Jones when he was cussing the chick out at the end of "The Rain.")    There are a lot of other dreadful songs on Reality Check that I'm not even going to bother mentioning.  This has to be the worst disc that Juvenile has ever put together in recent memory.  With an occasional track here and there that is even tolerable, Reality Check is not something you want to cop unless you are his biggest fan and can't live with yourself if you don't buy the album.  One thing is for sure...Juvenile better consider a legitimate reality check if he wants to stay in the rap game for years to come. +music
Long fall from Longfall+N+There are a couple OK tracks on this disc but this is far and away NOT the same Lost Trailers that put out some of my favorite music of the past few years.  Gone are the well crafted, story like lyrics and any sound of Southern rock. Those great stories (Longfall, Pontchartrain, Love & War, West End, Dougherty County, Under FM Waves and SO many more) and great music (See above as well as Red Sun, Sitting on Top of the World and Down in the Valley) have been replaced by Gravy, Dixie Boy Special & I'm a Country Man and the same old radio friendly country sound you can hear from anyone.  The sad irony in this are the lyrics to Under FM Waves (from New Age Cowboy) and how they talk about how much great music resides off radio--and look at what has happened: songs to created to make it on radio (which granted, should make them big).  Try their other 3 available cd's (Story of the New Age Cowboy, Trailer Trash and Welcome to the Woods). They have some other very hard to find music out there but these 3 should be available (Trailer Trash is a mix of songs from Rock Band, songs that ended up on Welcome, etc).  P.S. to the last review--Ryder Lee is the lead vocalist. Geoffrey Stokes Neilson is the guitarist and lead songwriter. +music
Wow!!!!!!+N+BE doesn't live up to the hype?  Whoever wrote that editorial needs to be punished. The court jester doesn't deserve to live.  Not only does BE live up to the hype; BE is the hype.  Common and Kanye reminiscent of Quincy and Michael, the early years.  When Michael was still black and male.  Simply stated, BE flows.  If BE were any tighter we couldn't afford it.  No need to skip or go back. Just enuff songs to make you listen to it again.  Great work of art.  Common and Kanye - damn!!!!+music
Please make it stop!!+N+I read recently that Sheryl Crow's song "Good is Good" a song from her new album, was nominated for a Grammy award. Seriously,how much time and effort could it possibly take to come up with that. TNMC, also won a Grammy when it was released. I still can not understand why, but I do have a theory. Simply put, the music industry is more interested in image than musical talent and integrity. While only a mediocre talent at best,Sheryl Crow is deified. I realize that this is only my opinion(and I have a right to state it) this type of music nauseates me. There is so much music throughout the world to be explored and appreciated. Do not let some in the music industry to bombard and assault you with this type of musical drek. I do have a solution: all the record producers and industry personnel responsible for the above-mentioned "crimes" should all be sentenced to a jail term for however long it takes them to recognize true talent and get some "SOUL." Peace+music
One of the worst products of current folk 'revivalism'+N+And folk revivalism is what it is, folks; I'll label it even if the populists fume at me because I know of more than 5 genres.  Meloy admits in interview after interview his taste for the Fairport Convention, Pentangle, and above all Shirely Collins.  He even did an album of "covers" of Shirley Collins' arrangements of British traditionals, a ridiculous concept if I ever heard of one.  Why cover another singer's versions of TRADITIONAL songs?  This idiocy should evince Meloy's alienation from a long tradition of reinterpretations of British folk music, and indeed most of his oeuvre consists of feeble attempts at ballad composition.  With no prosodic skill, he goes about constructing narratives modeled on such work as Shirley Collins' repertoire.  Evidently Meloy believes he can pen ballads as if he were a Walter Scott, S.T.C. or John Keats, but his weak stories show throughout the imaginative poverty of an American desperately attempting to beat an escape to the land of faerie.  The wistfulness and Romantic nostalgia of Meloy's work come off as trite and calculated for NPR yuppies.  Moreover, his vocal range consists entirely of yelp, melancholy warble and nasal whine--this whingeing troubadour sounds as if he constantly has a cold.  I'll admit the band is at least competent, but do yourself a favor: buy Comus' "First Utterance," the Incredible String Band's "The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter" or Shirley Collins' "No Roses" instead+music
amazing+P+This album showcases Collin Raye's amazing tenor to the fullest. Hits like "Love Me," "Little Rock," "My Kind of Girl," "Not That Different," and "I Can Still Feel You" are featured on this brilliant album. Raye's vocals are well done, as is the song selection. Most of the songs are ballads, Raye's specialty. If you are a fan of Collin Raye, then this album is a must-have.+music
Wanted: For wack rhymes!!!!!!!+N+I'm sorry but children that try to rap are just horrible. They are just a gimmick like the old school r and b artists that would come out called teeny boppers. I guess this lil one wants to be a "hip hop teeny bopper". Well guess what? You don't get teeny bopper reviews, you get grown up one's. Please stop rapping and go to college (or work as a mechanic) like a normal kid should+music
Bob Dylan Rocks with the Band+P+Though Dylan and the Band had played together a lot before this record (the Basement tapes and the 1967 tour), this is the first recording of them together that was released and I must say the Band's playing on this record is vastly different than those times, different than the live "Before the Flood" as well. I get almost a lose, playful feeling from them here, driven by Garth's excellent keyboards and Robbie's stunning guitar work. Love songs, dirges, uplifting songs, tough songs and torch songs, this is a record for the ages. Yes, it was overshadowed by "Blood on the Tracks," but it's been years now and still "Planet Waves" stands the test of time. I really like this record+music
Imagine a world without this band's boredom.....+N+Believe it or not, I had actually expected to hate this because it just doesn't suit me for the good kind of music. It sounds just the way I thought it would sound: crappy. It isn't hard enough to be all that good if you ask me. It is just too calm. {And now you probably think I'm a hypocrite because I like Enya}. At least Enya doesn't sound like someone who sounds like they are in a garage band attempting to record bad music. Not my style.+music
A "Not Necessary" remake - the Originals are better+N+Sorry, I thought this would be a great updated version of the classic SHR music - and I was really disappointed. I don't really understand the point of this album - why "remake" music that was timeless and pretty much perfect in the first place?  I can't imagine my own kids actually learning anything from these remakes (and bottom line, wasn't that the point?)... and listening to "No More Kings" was downright depressing - when SHR has always had the exact-opposite effect!+music
This is not good, don't believe the hype!+N+Now I have heard a lot of people say that this is a classic, and that it may be the most creative CD of all time, but when I take a listen, I just laugh. There are so many better rappers who have a million times the talent that Missy Elliot has and are so much more creative. Honestly, and the lyrics are awful, only a couple of the beats are okay, but after listening to Missy Elliot's annoying voice, then you will be very frustrated like I was that I bought this+music
Supa dupa garbage.+N+What a thought provoking and creative album title.I wonder how long it took her to come up with that name?I cant believe the trendy garbage people listen to these days.All the songs sound the same and have the same pointless lyrics to them.She cant produce,rap write or do much of anything of value.I saw this trash at tower records and it was just collecting dust.Save your money and dont buy any of her worthless junk ever again.Listen to some real artists like black sabbath,judas priest or iron maiden.Dont forget to vote for my review+music
Good for a general Iggy collection+P+If you are looking for just a general overview of Iggy's career, I'd say this is a pretty good way to go.  It contains a bit of music from each section of his career+music
The GREATEST soundtrack of all time!+P+This motion picture soundtrack is the best! That`s my opinion anyway; the movie (National Treasure - Starring: Nicolas Cage) has been one of my top favorites ever since it came out. I also recommend the "Titanic" soundtrack as well if you are interested in this one. And if you have doubts as to whether or not to buy this CD, try listening to the clips. My personal favorite is: "National Treasure Suite" (Track 1). The Tracks: "Library of Congress" (Track 4), and "Declaration of Independence" (Track 2) are nice slower ones. Track: "Spectacle Discovery" (Track 10) is another one of my favorites also. Some of the tracks on this CD can be a little repetitive, but all in all, I think this CD is worth the money+music
Off the Chain+P+This CD is a must have if you are a Hot Boys (Old school Cash Money) fan+music
If you actually want to listen to punk...+N+...don't buy this CD.  Most of this is emo, and quite a bit of it is meandering and not particularly catchy.  There are a few good bands on this CD--enough to merit maybe listening to it once or twice, but it's not worth your time if you're an actual punk fan.  It has an interesting mix of music, but it doesn't fit together too well.  The upsides to this compilation are as follows:  one, the Dropkick Murphys song, and two, it's inexpensive.  However, it's even less expensive to just forget about buying this CD at all+music
WORST OF PUNK-O-RAMA+N+How can they even call this punk. Were's six feet under or slayer. Maybe some cibo matto. These are the bands they need to add....... Not yellowcard and other crummy emo band+music
Why RBX? Why didnt you bring the skills  you have?+N+RBX is one of my favorite rappers, he has a dark, sinister style. Instead of dropping a unique, straight hip hop album(which is what I was expecting). He decided to make a g-funk album co-starring his whole muthaf@$#ing family.This is more of a compilation because RBX only does a small handfull of songs solo, and predictably, those ones are basicly the best tracks with the exception of the snoop and daz collabos. So RBX I ask you, why would you try to make an album featuring mostly talentless artists on your record label, when you could have done a REAL DOPE solo album (how do I miss Heatmizer) and package a compilation of your artists with the album? I could not be more disappointed. I would rather spend my 11.99 on anything but this cd, Sorry X, you wasted your talent on this album, dont be mad at me+music
great cd+P+Seth Maheu "College Student"....your high. remedy is probably the song i like LEAST on this album. i hate it. the rest of the songs are awesome though, my favs are "because of me" "world falls away" "tongue" and "simplest mistake". this cd is a solid effort.  and seth, you know Ef all about music. the fact u like remedy the best, and suggested that anything by lloyd banks is worth buying shows you have terrible taste. Jurrassic 5 are good, but "amazing lyricism"?? no. jurrasic 5 are good because they are fun, and keep the forumla simple and old school. true hip hop. but there are LEGIONS of more talented emcees.   dont EVER say anything about lloyd banks again. he is terrible and makes outdated, gangster BS. he should get over himself and stop furthering the stereotypes everyone has of hip-hop. hip-hop has a terrible name becuase of losers like him, 50, ja, and eminem (yeah he USED to be good).  BUY THIS SEETHER ALBUM+music
YUCK, YUCK, YUCK+N+I am only in my 20's but I did grow up listening to the original album of A Chorus Line (my mom used to play it while we were cleaning) and I gotta say that this remake is awful.  The original cast had great passion in their voices and the new cast is very blah.  I don't recomend this at all.  If you really love and appreciate the music find a copy of the orginal and I know that you will enjoy it much better+music
Some really curious musical choices hamstring this recording.+N+There are several questions I have after listening to this CD.  Why are the tempos so crazy?  The opening number plods along like a funeral march, while At The Ballet zips past as if the performers are on crank.  Part of me suspects that cast is performing against a pre-recorded accompaniment track.  Why does everything sound so thin?  These orchestrations were created to achieve maximum resonance in live acoustic settings.  On this CD, it's like every single instrument is separately mic'ed and mixed to within an inch of its life, sometimes to the detriment of the overall sound.  Sometimes, obviously live instruments sound like MIDI.  Usually it's the sound engineer's job to make the opposite happen!  Why are the vocals so "hot"?  In the OBC, there were occasions when the entire chorus would get overwhelmed by reverb and full-sounding orchestra.  Now it's the vocals that tear at the balance.  Who cast this show?  I'm not going to single any one cast member out because it would rude, but -- oh screw it.  You deserve to know.  This Cassie is some serious vocal ugly.  I didn't once wonder along with Zach why she was stuck auditioning on the line, like I did with Ms. Donna McKechnie's fabulous triple threat.  Why not update some of the orchestrations?  I have a deep and abiding respect for Jonathan Tunick (who is among my top three favorite Broadway creative types), but it's 2006.  Wah wah pedals are out.  Overall, although this CD is good for completists, it's not going to knock the OBC recording out of it's slot as the definitive A CHORUS LINE recording.  If you don't have a Chorus Line CD and are trying to decide which one to buy, track down the re-mastered version of the original broadway cast.  It's vintage, but it has a raw warmth that is missing from the revival cast+music
SOAD at its worst+N+That moron who said their music hasent changed is so dumb and obviousley not a true SOAD fan. Ive been a SOAD fan since they were just a small band with loads of potential. SOAD was a great album and Toxicity was sweet and Steal This Album was really a great musical adventure but this album just isnt SOAD at all. Ok in all fairness if I was writing this review and this was their debut album great album overall reallly a 4.5/5 truthfully. But compared to their earlier work this just doenst cut it, their older stuff was way way better then this crap. And Daron should stop trying to get so much singing time in he really isnt that good of a singer and Serj is much better+music
A.J. is a Super Songwriter - Duh!+P+Absolutely great collection of Alan Jackson's best, without the filler.  A must-have.  By the way, is everyone laughing yet at the 9/2/01 reviewer who suggested that Alan Jackson's "songwriting skills need work"?!+music
Yay ESP!+P+In 1987 Barry, Robin, and Maurice were reunited! Or at least that's how new distributor Warner Brothers tried to sell it.  Even though the brothers never really left themselves or us, but  I digress.  I only have this album on cdr, since Warner's seemed to make the release very scarce.  The cover is cool, though.  The boys look totally different from when audiences remembered them last. No white, no hair, well not as much anyway.  Black. Dark, edgy.  I'm Pip and I've come to play!          ESP is naturally the song to lead off the album.  It is different from any other project the Brothers did at the time.  Better than Walls Have Eyes, more polished than Now Voyager.  However, ESP is also very stand alone on this album and nothing else here sounds like it.  (Not that I mind that of course.)  We heard some of Robin's coming out voice party on Living Eyes, but in songs shared with Baz.  Barry moved onto some heavy producing, but without Robin.  ESP brings them together again and slams both powerhouses.  There is so much going on in this song, you can imagine this is what a telepath hears. Noise, each trying to have its own say, competing with everything else that is heard, and all of it's important.  Brilliant.          Ah, You Win Again.  Although not as well know in the US as the Fever Monsters, this song is indeed one of those monster songs that you just have to love.  There are so many hooks, lines, and sinkers musically, lyrically, vocally. From the whole second verse's play on `Nobody stops this body' to Robin's Oh Baby! wail to that bombing drum throughout.  Hot damn.  This song did actually even encroach the US charts, imagine that!         Live Or Die (Hold Me Like A Child)  (What is it with them and parenthesis?) is the first slow song presented.  Barry returns to his shrill notes and sometimes the versus are tough to understand.  The chorus is strong and the lyrics as always are top notch.  The ad-libbed over the top ending is perfect eighties power ballad fashion.  The music and high voices are a little dated, but you can't help but try and sing along when your driving home alone late at night, or is that just me?          Giving Up The Ghost  sound a bit more like the tracks on Walls Have Eyes, but that's ok. Great music rifts.  Some of the refrains are a bit much, and one of the times where I might say the chorus is the weaker part of the song. Then again, the boys hold out `Ghooooost!' and it sounds cool again.  Robin sounds great in the verses, since you can understand him seventy percent of the time.  ;0)        The Longest Night is one of the hotter Bee Gees songs in my opinion, just like Bodyguard.  After their solo and side projects in the early eighties, the brothers came back for ESP stronger again.  Robin with this song has somehow managed to combine the weeping Joke sound with the booming voice he developed post Fever.  The vibrato was always there, but the five o'clock shadow eighties sounds fit Robin's haunting lyrics as the sixties mellow sound did.   Indeed ESP together with Walls Have Eyes is a dang good hunk of Gibb material that it seems everyone missed. Pity.          Every album has to have a fun song and This Is Your Life is ESP's.   It's nice to see the Brothers come back and kind of laugh off and yet embrace their past music.  The lyrics `line-drop' titles of other Bee Gees songs during the interlude.  Can I tell you this is the only time I sing to `JJJive Talkin'!  It's Barry rapping but with dribs and drabs from the old songs cutting in and out. Very cool.  I could recommend the entire album on that interlude alone if I had to, but I don't.         Outside of its sweet and soft lyrics and vocals, Angela  is in my mind a little bit of a statement song.   Sometimes it feels like you can almost exchange `Angela' for `America'.  Followed by the line `I'm still alive', I wonder if the boys were making a veiled statement at us stubborn Yanks.  Indeed they were still alive, and maybe this is also a pun on Stayin' Alive. The New York times effect a man, remember.  ;0)  The feel of the song is so innocent and easy feeling, but I suspect more!  The girl that got away? I think not.          Maurice brings this album to a standstill with Overnight.  It's the closest in vein to the song ESP.  Maurice, however, adds not telepathy, but animal magnetism.  It's a different kind of psychic sense.  The lyrics  are so detailed and the interlude combining the echo of all three voices is exceptional.  The music has, if there is such a thing, a predatory feeling that's good.  By the end of the song you are totally sold and yelling back, "All right I'll stay!"         In the eighties and later on High Civilization, The Brothers seem to have a little Motown tribute revival thing going. Crazy For Your Love is fascinating in that it is has a Motown throwback vibe and at the same time, it's straight eighties bubblegum pop.  (Tiffany, anyone?)  I would cringe if I heard some tween today singing any song about love and ice cream .  However, play Crazy for a kid today, they will like it, and never know it is old men singing in 1987!  How ingenious is it to find such a timeless song here?!         Backtafunk  is not your traditional Gibb song.  It sounds a bit...I want to say New Edition! Naturally the brothers master all the hip beats and singing, even if the lyrics are slightly bland.  Again however, the breakaway interlude makes the song.  The harmony and fun of the boys come in and the song kicks up to another level.  Is Barry scatting? Incredible!         ESP ends with the ESP Vocal Reprise, and I don't really know why.  Its  just the opening echo of the voices on the first track, but it does sound cool. Allow me to mention the oddities associated with ESP, as you knew there would be some! Young Love is an unreleased cut that didn't make the album.  I managed to download a piece that cuts short, but it's heavy in the low key Maurice vein.  Honestly I don't know why it was cut.  The 1989 compilation Tales From The Brothers Gibb contains an ESP Demo that is very similar to the final version, just missing a few production marks.  Fans should also check out The One For All Tour VHS and DVD for concert footage of the boys singing Giving Up The Ghost and extras from One.          Warner Brothers does not realize The Bee Gees quality they possess, and they should re-release ESP.  I wonder if this album planned to have any sort of theme to it? Each song touches a different type of emotion and vibe, and aren't songs in a way a psychic connection from one person to another? Interesting theory, Kristin. Interesting. +music
another loser band+N+Hooba...stank...stinks and will always stink. I don't know about the rest of the CD, but listening to The Reason is about as pleasant as sticking your hand into a running garbage disposal.  I'm not a perfect perrrrsssonn. Egad+music
Damn, another underdone turd, send it back!+N+I was just speechless when i first heard this. What was known as the best heavy metal band on earth 10 years prior, has become a lion without balls or teeth. Country-influenced tunes!? Slow, blues-influenced songs? NO way, NO thanks.  Also a very overrated album. The Black Album was OKAY but 3 stars in my book..but man this was a sharp right turn for them and the beginning of the end for Metallica.PS: The Memory Remains and Unforgiven 2 are HORRIBLE SONGS.+music
Best rap group since N.W.A.+P+These guys are the best group out right now. Every single rapper is AMAZING even Bizarre who is not great so far as flow but probably has the funniest lyrics. This album brought me some of my favorite songs to date including Sh*t Can Happen, Pistol Pistol, Ain't Nuttin' But Music, American Psycho, Fight Music & Revelation. My favorite rappers are Swifty & Eminem but the fact is every one should have a solo album out by now (besides Em, only Proof (R.I.P.) & Bizarre do... which are my least favorite rappers in the group) Every song is great even the skits are enjoyable. If you don't have this yet, you are missing out on one of the best cds ever+music
Carmen Miranda!  Ay! Ay! Ay!+P+OK...there may be alot of songs on here that you don't know from her Hollywood films, but don't let that stop you.  She is marvelous and fun!  Another reviewer said they were disappointed with this...ignore them and buy it+music
Great musical+P+The music in this musical uncannily remains faithful to ABBA music and the story line which was written to showcase the music.  I saw the Las Vegas production, not the the original London production yet the music sung and played in the LV production was just as fantastic as that within the original production. If you like ABBA,(and who does not?) and cannot spring for the price of a ticket, this DVD is the next best thing+music
Puts Nashville Commercial Establishment to shame!!!+P+My only regret was not getting this album sooner.  The music and lyrics are real and unpretentious.  Wayne Hancock is a true American gem+music
I LOVE MAYSA!!![.]+N+let's just get this out of the way now. maysa? i'm on your team babes, but this cd just hasn't done it for me. i got your 1st cd & was hooked. i waited for the next & was floored! not in a good way! the cd jacket was so drab & tired, just like damn near every song inside the case. i let it sit on my shelf & decided to give it a listen again. still i didn't feel it. it's in my car right now & i still can't get through it all. i'm still on your team though. i have your latest & i play it 2 death. over & over. cd's 1 & 3 are both must haves. but this 1 stinks+music
Jerry, te queremos mucho, pero...+N+Jerry, si estas leyendo esto: Creo que todos estamos de acuerdo en decir que eres un cantante excepcional. Te queremos mucho!!!  Pero queremos que vuelvas a cantar salsa, como la del tiempo de "Cuenta Conmigo", "Cara de Nino", y "Magia"...  No te dejes influenciar por la musica que esta de moda hoy, el reggaeton no te va!!! No me malinterpretes: hasta tu disco "Vuela muy alto" me encanto, pero creo que ahora es tiempo de volver a la musica que mejor te queda. Seguire escuchando tus discos de salsa anteriores hasta que vuelvas a sacar uno nuevo.  Vamos, por favor, te lo rogamos!!! Te quiere tu fan DJ LOLA, desde Montreal, Canada+music
Psychedelia Classic!+P+"The Who Sell Out" is one among ( at least 3 ) several Who master pieces. With its build up as a commercial radio station program with commercials in between the songs and overall great songwriting, the album may very well be the most varied and most entertaining Who album.  1967 was a year of psychedelia in rock music and the Who were among the pioneers of that trend. This is obvious from the first track of the album "Armenia in the Sky". The outstanding single "I Can See For Miles" is among the very best psychelia songs recorded.   The acoustic "Mary Anne With the Shaky Hand" is another Who favourite - beautiful melody, great rhythm and intelligent lyrics.  Actually the lyrics are overall great on this album  - with wit and homour.  Songs like "Odorono" and "Tattoo" are rarely included on Who compilations - and they're both bound to be great positive surprises to the first-time listener of the album.   "Our Love Was" and "I Can't Reach" are other fine tracks - both more in the style of their previous album "A Quick One".   I might be expected that the short commercials ( most of them musically done ) would be annoying after the first couple listens - but this is really not the case. These short tracks works great in the context of the album.   Only the final two tracks of the original album seem a little out of place. Townshend's acoustic "Sunrise" is quite beautiful, but "Rael" feels somewhat longwinded and dated.  Most of the bonus-tracks are great - most of the apparently were only left out due to lack of space on the vinyl format.   Try to shuffle the tracks - the bonus-tracks really fit in nicely with the originals.+music
Easily one of the most talented groups to come out of UK+P+This album demonstrates the musical mastery of the legendary Who. It's also interesting how today's groups like Green Day and Limp Bizkit don't even close to the Who. And to Orion, a reviewer on this forum, you're a sad case, my friend. I sincerely hope that you successfully seek out the psychological help that you so desperately are in need of+music
WORST ALBUMS OF ALL TIME...THE WHO GREATEST HITS+N+The Who don't have any talent. They are overrated, and only made 1 decent song in Wont Get Fooled Again. Avoid this lousy compilation and get Dire Straits Making Movies insted+music
Great release, a little raw....+P+I was introduced to MCR through Three cheers for sweet revenge, which is one of the best albums to ever be released. I brought you my bullets, you brought me your love is a very, very good release. All the songs are awesome, and the intensity and ferocity that drew me MCR in the first place is well in place on this album. But, it seems that they were still finding their sound and direction on this album. Very good album, but the recording is very raw, semi-okay production. But nevertheless a great release that you must check out...My favorite song is Drowning lessons+music
this is supposed to b gangsta?+N+how all yall fools gonna come up in here calling this trash gangsta.. Kali is where the real ridas live and die notthe dirty.. DIRTY... south or the LEAST coast.. everyone since the mid 90's has bitten the west coast and this is no exception.. tha frontlinerz have a track called ''gangsta in me'' and they put it right on these so-called gangsta's callin themselves trap ni66az.. this is a joke.. like everything else and whoever said this isnt commercial.. give it up.. this record is sitting on wal-marts shelves!!! i heard this and had one serious laugh.. boyz n da hood... another example of how you suckers bite the west..+music
Founder of Wendy's makes rock'n'roll!+P+Few people are aware that Dave Thomas, in addition to being the founder and spokesman of the Wendy's hamburger chain, was also the leader of Pere Ubu. Clearly Mr. Thomas wasn't in it for the money, since he made his fortune selling good old-fashioned hamburgers, and so he was free to pursue his own musical muse. The results are sometimes splendid, sometimes things go awry, but it's always the unique stylings of Dave Thomas that characterize this raw, passionate music. Kinda makes you wonder what would have happened if Carl Karcher, founder of Carl's Junior, had also pursued music with such abandon and freedom from financial considerations+music
This may have been their breakthrough on the charts but.....+N+It sucks big time!!!!!!! Alot of this was experienced in my ears those first few months in Hell...I mean Florida. The first song I heard from this was "Today", and I thought it was good the first time I heard it as it was only a 30 second snipet that I heard, but then when I heard the entire song it was depressing, and then there was "Disarm" which I hated from day one, and the same with "Cherub Rock". I just felt like I shouldn't have even bought this at this particular time in my life, but I guess I was trying to give them the benefit of the doubt. However, with one song barely tolerable which is "Mayonaise" I'm ready to dismiss this as one of the worst of the 90's+music
Good only for filling in the blanks+N+This CD is a total misrepresentation.  MANY of the songs are VERY poorly done concert versions of songs.  They even use the exact same audience cheering track on several songs.  Buy it only if you are a fan looking to fill in missing songs in your collection.  Don't buy it thinking you are getting all the original hits.  14 songs are live.  One appears to be re-recorded.  The rest are the originals.  Also, on CD #2 many of the media tags are incorrect.  When you play "All I Really Need Is You" (Live) the title "Heartbreak Hotel" shows.  When you play "Headed for the Future" the song title "All I Really Need Is You" shows.  When you play "Heartbreak Hotel" the song title "Headed for the Future" shows.  Overall, a VERY sloppy project they obviously just rushed to market not caring about quality+music
So-So CD....Terrible Band+N+As a well-educated rock music,especially emo-punk,person,I was sickened every time i tried to listen to this CD all the way through.Why? It's definitely one of the less-than-great emo albums ever (not completely horrible,though)and the fact that this band is led by a singer who shouldn't be bragging about his "musical genius" when he should first realize how disgusting his voice sounds compared to most other emo singers,isn't sweetening the deal.When i bought this album,it had a sticker on it that read:"If you like Taking Back Sunday,Brand New and The Used,you'll love Matchbook Romance!"I should have known how desperate they were when i read that.But more disturbing is the fact that they dared compared themselves to Taking Back Sunday? TBS is actually an emo band that doesn't sound recicled.And Brand New?Have they heard Deja Entendu?That album is not only the best emo album,but definitely one of the best albums of all time-in any genre+music
Where's the beef, Alf?+P+I'm afraid Alfonso Lozada has missed the point. The film is about a span of time in the life of one person, Tony Wilson, and is thus structured around his experiences. At the same time, the film is not a documentary but a fictionalized account. On top of all this, the &quot;Tony&quot; character does mention the short shrift the Stone Roses get. Is it really a surprise to find the soundtrack album bereft of artists which did not appear in the film+music
One of the few....+P+For me, there have always been those bands where I like them but can only listen to a few of the songs because of the lead singers voice. This would include Maroon 5, Billy Talent, and Clap Your Hands Say Yea. While I applaud these bands for being unique, it is hard to listen to an entire cd of it. Hot Hot Heat is one of the only exceptions I have ever had. I can listen to their cd's over and over and not have to stop after the 3rd or 4th track. While anything can become irritating, it takes Hot Hot Heat quite a while to get to me. I am also not a huge fan of these new English bands like Snow Patrol and Arctic Monkeys, but yet again Hot Hot Heat has something that just sticks with me. I recommend this cd as well as Make Up The Breakdown. Very good, upbeat songs that you will enjoy full-heartedly on a car ride home+music
Hell yeah!!!+P+This is the best R&B female album out this year. I listen to this CD all day. Although it has 10 songs like the other chick... Monica has something to say and relates to many women out there. I love this CD. My favorite is Hell No. If you have not done so go and get this immediatley especially if you wasted your money on BDay like I did+music
Hey, it was good...+P+Well Crossfade may just be another modern rock Alt Metal band but that doesn't make them bad. Sure, they don't really add anything new to the music out now but that shouldn't take away from the music itself. All I know is from what I heard they have some really good tracks. I first heard the track "Cold" on the radio and it was just one of those songs that I love instantly. I just had to go out and get the album. After getting the album It turned out to be pretty good. I pretty much enjoyed everything on here. Although, my favorite tracks would have to be "Cold", "Starless", "Colors", and "Dead Skin". Here's the track ratings...  1. Starless - 9.5/10  2. Cold - 10/10  3. So Far Away - 9.5/10  4. Colors - 10/10  5. Death Trend Setta - 10/10   6. The Deep End - 9/10 7. No Giving Up - 9.5/10 8. Dead Skin - 10/10 9. Disco - 7/10  10. The Unknown - 9/10  Overall: 93% A-  Sure, it's not really anything new but It is good and a nice listen. I enjoyed this album very much and am very curious to see what Crossfade has done with their new album that was just released. Anyway, anyone who's into this style of music will probably end up finding a bunch of other good tracks for their music collection. +music
Worthy sophomore effort+P+Out of Exile, like the debut, rocks out of the blocks riding a rolling riff that once again confirms that these guys are actually steeped in classic hard rock folklore. Again we see Rick Rubin twiddling the knobs for a fine selection of mature hard rock. Chris Cornell is again in full possession of a voice capable of putting all sorts of feeling into his lyrics. Indeed the fact that Cornell writes all the lyrics is interesting - the fact that this band has had to work out how to operate after their still talked about former bands was another hurdle these dudes had to get over. Lucky for us that they did.  This second instalment of the Audioslave story sounds much like the first which is no bad thing. The riffs are so smooth - who let the 70's back in? - and the band show full well the way to alternate rockers with mellower stuff. This album does fell a little mellower overall. Not sure if that's why the album flopped to a certain extent in certain territories but the band have corrected the slight problem of too many tracks that affected the debut.  This ablum probably shut some of the naysayers up. Sure it's sales weren't up there with the debut but it's as consistent as the first album and it's showed that this band were a serious proposition and not just a one off project and that's a good thing as hard rock needs such gimmick free bands in the mix as a foil to some of the more hysterical bands out there. In the final analysis this is a four star release for those who like their hard rock from talented players and full off rollicking riffs for the melodies to ride along.  Token non musical gripe - why the dull/crap cover+music
Awesome Music!  Some of the best I've ever heard!+P+The movie is awesome, but the cd is equally amazing.  Awe-inspiring, from quiet, peaceful music to the full orchestra in the finale at the end, this is one of the best soundtracks ever written!  A great gift to yourself or friends+music
One good song.+N+I absolutely loved that song "Carry On Wayward Son" which sounds like one of the greatest stuff in history. Rest of the other songs on this album are not that good. 2-stars+music
Language, context and music+P+This is a somewhat interesting exploration of language, semantics and rhythm.  It is more surreal in it's use of deconstructed conversations placed with new and different contexts.  Some of it reminds one greatly of Korean Samul-nori music, which relies mostly upon percussion and rhythm that is based upon the Korean language (listen to No. 6, "An Animated Description of Mr. Maps" for a very clear example of such.  While some tracks are very ingaging and suggest a different musical line of exploration from much conventional music, there is a problematic sameness in instrumentation that is sometimes very uninteresting due to a lack of musical development. The Books could end up doing very well if they were to invest more time in their musical development of their ideas and instrumentation.  Layering samples can only go so far before it is boring+music
vague noodling+N+Knopfler has once again fallen far short of the promise inherent in those long ago days of Dire Straits. Perhaps he is attempting to be Mr. Atkins reincarnate, but if that is the case then he should  buy the white shoes and move to Florida. Simply put, a terrible album with little to recommend it.+music
Ouch!+N+I feel sorry for those who thought this was more great YES-Jon Anderson Christmas music.  I'm one of the few fortunate souls who actually found a 3 Ships CD after it was out of print.  Paid some $30+ for it, but worth every penny.  Too bad ripping and passing out mp3's is illegal, because I'd share!  Add my name to the "Bring Back 3 Ships!" petition+music
Nicks Version of Tragic Kingdom+P+On What's Left of Me, Nick Lachey sings about lost love and heartbreak for they whole duration of the CD.  This is his version of No Doubt's Tragic Kingdom CD.  Every song is about a broken relationship.  The Lyrics are very good and the songs are also very well done.  Don't buy this CD if you are looking for his SoulO upbeat fluff.  The tone of this CD is sad.  Most of the songs are ballads.  But not slow ballads more like pop rock power ballads.  He has a great voice.  It is strong and has a great tone.  Out of every boy-bander I have ever heard I would say he has the most talent.  Not only is his voice strong but it is also great because he sounds like a man not a girl, (i.e. Justin Timberlake).  The stand out tracks are: I Can't Hate You Anymore, On Your Own, and Beautiful.  The rest of the songs are good too.  This CD finally makes him a legitimate music star+music
I got what I expected+N+I recieved this CD as a present, not thinking much about it since its southern rap  This CD has almost no lyrical talent  The reason I gave it 2 stars, is because I enjoyed the production of some songs that were done by the Neptunes.  Like almost all southern rap now, its got heavy bass but no lyrical talent.  So if your one of those clueless kids that like rap (mainstream rap) I would say you could possible enjoy this cd+music
Boring+N+The show rocks, the soundtrack sucks. I didn't recognize any of the songs from the show, that alone tells you how memorable this soundtrack is. Dismal and dissapointing :+music
Fnak - this is bad.+N+I liked the first album and I won't pretend to be an aficionado of this genre, but some things I have learned:  1) Don't rap with a touch of laryngitis 2) Maybe sing/rap with the beat and not just near it 3) Drop the "my life sucks" and "everyone hates me" tracks - whoops that is the entire album 4) I don't think the world can stand more than one rapped sad piano ballad 5) If every background singer has a better voice, perhaps your are done  Anyone want to buy a used CD+music
Bush's weakest effort.+N+Kate Bush's second album, "Lionheart", may be the weakest in her catalog.  Its clear Bush did not want to fall into the trap of constructing "The Kick Inside Part Two", and instead reaches in a number of different directions, some successful, some less so.  Musically, the album takes stabs at ballads similar to the first record ("In Search of Peter Pan", "In the Warm Room"), a more pop structure ("Wow"), rhythmic shifts ("Don't Put Your Foot on the Heartbrake") an almost shuffle ("Fullhouse") and a gret rock song ("Hammer Horror").  Lyrically, Bush has added a level of sensuality to her work ("Symphony in Blue") and shows no sign of shying away from controversial subjects ("Kashka from Baghdad").  The problem is that it doesn't hang together well to my mind-- admittedly, my rating for the album is in many ways relative to Bush's other work, no album with the absolutelyu amazing "Kashka from Baghdad" can be all that bad, and certainly "Symphony in Blue" is strong enough to stop you in your tracks, but the album just doesn't work for me.  For early Bush, try her debut ("The Kick Inside") or the stunning "Never For Ever"+music
I'm a fan...but+N+this CD is not good.  Luckily, I only paid 5 bucks for the used copy.  I mean do we really want to hear incomplete songs?  I don't.  The couple of actual completed songs are pretty good so it gets 2 stars as opposed to the one star it probably deserves.  Bruce really took a page from Gene's book here and went after the money.  Should be an EP and nothing more+music
poorly produced+N+This cd just doesnt sound good which means it was poorly produced. Any 1999 cd should have better sound quality. Like the other reviewers stated,i too found it dissapointing that the wrestlers theme songs were approximately 1 minute long each.Gotta hit the repeat button to enjoy them a little longer. They could have been longer and the cd could have done without the irrelevant remarks made here and there by the commentators. Curiously too,where is the NWO's music+music
A flavor of the month past its due date+N+Painful to hear and painful to watch.  A yester-year pop singer who doesn't have the courage to quit.  There is nothing left to do so she keeps throwing out pointless album after pointless album to stay in the spotlight; if that isn't the highest form of egoism I don't know what is.  She's got fame she's got fortune she had her hits why not just go now please?  What she use to do for shock value in the early days now seems so trite and pathetic.  The woman is nothing more then a spectacle with very little substance.  She uses anything from sex to religion to self promote.  Yes I was a fan in the days of Like a prayer and Vogue but I have moved on, why Madonna doesn't come to the same conclusion I will never understand.  This CD is good for the flavor of the month but its shelf life is way past due.  I challenge Madonna to put on a concert without all the antics and overt sexual malarkey that dominates her shows; she would be booed right off the stage if that were to happen.  And please enough with the crucifixion stunts all ready.  +music
This is what its all about+P+This album is what the goo is all about.......they were at their BEST here!!!!!!!!!!  This was the classic album they will never ever be able to pruduce again+music
Another round of this...+N+Nelly's sophomore album was just as bad as his first one. The song Hot In Herre was a decent lead off single, so I thought that he might have came to his senses a little bit. Boy was I wrong. More singing and this time with Kelly Rowland from Destiny's Child on the song Delimma and a song with Justin Timberlake. Now he makes a somewhat attempt to impress me by taking Beanie Siegel's Roc Tha Mic (Remix) and puts it on his CD, not to mention taking a shot a hip hop legend KRS-One. Another track worth listening to is #1 and possibly the only song that he has made by himself worth listening to. Everything else, just a big no no. Once again he has appealed himself to the people who hardly listening to rap, because I even hear that song with Kelly Rowland on oldies radio stations. This right here has got to stop, because I had enough of it.+music
From Start to Finish. . . a Killer Album!+P+Bob is the King!  The KING!  Get this disc, you will dig it.  You can really sense the urgency in this CD.  Go to Bob's site, check out some of his notes on the Album.  If you can make to Austin, TX, spend about 2 weeks going to Bob's shows and you will understand.  From Joe Rockhead to Texas Bluegrass Masacre, Bob's the real deal, always pushing boundries, coming up with new sounds, un-corporate, straight ahead Rock and Roll+music
the man in black+P+I'm trying to get everything he ever did, a real her+music
Don't stop Badu+P+Don''t waste anymore time in reading reviews.  Go and get this album+music
Low Point  for Springsteen+N+I'm not the biggest fan of Springsteen, but I have liked a lot of what he's done in the past. I wasted my money on this one. It sounds like uninspired mumbling. Not much musical or vocal variation at all among the songs. Nothing stands out. No experimentation. There might be some good story lines in the songs, but I usually can't understand him anyway. I liked two songs, but not enough to get the album out and turn it on. I never desire to play it after a few listenings. So beware, unless your a huge fan and want all his music, this one may let you down.+music
long time fan, very mad.+N+bought this cd quite a while ago. it is probably very good, but how can i tell when it won't play on my stereo? this dual disc format is the music industries way of screwing long time fans. this sticking it to the fan is about as low as it gets. after buying the disc, i noticed the tiny warning on the back that says "audio side of disc does not conform to cd specifications and therefor not all cd players will play the audio side of this disc." WHAT A GREAT IDEA: SELL A DISC TO PEOPLE THAT WON'T PLAY FOR EVERYBODY. THANKS A..HOLES+music
wow!!!+P+I AM A TRUE SMOOTH JAZZ FAN AND I HAVE TO SAY THIS IS THE BEST CD BRIAN HAS EVER MADE." COME ON UP " IS GOOD BUT "NICE AND SLOW" IS AS GOOD AS IT GETS.LISTEN ONE TIME AND YOU WILL BE HOOKED I KNOW I WAS.                                   +music
Richness in vocal style and upbeat melody...+P+Nicholas Reyes has the absolutely perfect voice for this music...a fantastic collection of energetic rhythms to  keep you moving!!  +music
ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ+N+For a group that exudes such passion in their music (LIVE FROM BUFFALO anybody?) this song is like a funeral dirge. I can only hope that they haven't released the full album because they are trying to rekindle the passion that has made them the fan-favorite that they are.  Take your time guys - let's get your BEST work.   T+music
Murs Does it Again+P+I rated this album 5 stars because it wouldn't let me do a 4.9 star. 3:16 was the perfect LP. This is very close. There is no one song that stands out like there was on 3:16 with, Walk Like A Man, but still, the cd is one of the best yet.  Let me say this, I have 3 Murs CDs, The end of the beginning, 3:16, and now Murray's Revenge. This is the second best of the 3. Track 6, Dreamchaser, is definately worth putting on repeat all day. That is my favorite song on the cd.  All of the tracks on here are solid.   For someone trying to get a feel for Murs and his style, he uses a lot of samples in his beats like Kanye West, and his flow, well, hes in a league of his own. One of the best lyricists out there today and maybe of all time. He is not underground, but not big yet either. He deserves air time. His tracks aren't aimed for that like say, a Nelly or Little Jon.  All I can say is, Murs deserves to be one of the TOP emcees in the business. And in my opinion, he is, by far. It would be interesting to see a colaboration between Murs and say, Mos Def or The Roots.  All in all, BUY THIS CD+music
Listen to the Samples to get an Idea if Your'e Unfamiliar+P+Bow Wow Wow is not a Household Name, They Charted Once in the USA with "I want Candy" (Top 50), and released only 3 Proper Albums...Their Sound is Tribal, the Lead Singer Annabella often Yelps to Percussive Drumming and throbbing Bass, The Mixture yields Many Great Tunes, but it can take getting used to, as it did for Me, I was not a Fan untill much listening...If You don't know a lot of the Group's Songs, I suggest listening to as many 30 second Samples as possible to get a feeling of whether this stuff is digestible...Most of the Songs here are first-rate, I particularly Love "TV Savage", "Golly Golly Go Buddy!" and "Louis Qatorze", along with Annabella's Solo Turn "Fever"....If You want to explore further, I suggest the CD "Girl Bites Dog: Your Compact Disc Pet" to round out Your Collection, it includes more Gems, such as "Sexy Effiel Tower" (Where 14 Year-Old Annabella Pants Orgasmically...and more authentically than Donna Summer)and "Radio G String", as well as 3 Cuts from this CD in different versions; But begin here, and don't go further unless You Adore this CD....+music
Awesome album+P+One of my top fave Rasputina albums. Tons of great songs, very few joke songs, and great art work+music
Blew My Mind+P+I've been listening to Chris Cornell for about two years, after discovering him in Audioslave. Then I heard "Black Hole Sun" and "Spoonman" and after that more or less forgot about Soundgarden. My friend lent me this CD one day and I forgot about it for a month or two and finally listened to it yesterday and well...Wow. First off, Chris Cornell has one of the strongest, most recognizable voices in rock and he has such range it's amazing. These songs are all hard, raw, catchy, and all have a great guitar & drum sound. "Outshined" is probably my favorite Soundgarden song of all time. No rock fan should pass this up:  1. Rusty Cage-5/5-One of my favorite Soundgarden songs. It's fu**ing great; Chris Cornell hits some great notes too. 2. Outshined-5/5-Fu**ing killer! The chorus is catchy as hell. 3. Slaves & Bulldozers-5/5-Chris Cornell has an awesome screaming voice. This song has some good lyrics, guitar solo is good, and Matt Cameron's drumming stands out. 4. Jesus Christ Pose-5/5-I don't know what this song is about, but it kicks  a$$. The music (guitar & drumming anyway) is really good. 5. Face Pollution-5/5-Great title, the song is OK. The shortest song on the album. I know I'm probably hallucinating but it sounds like Maynard James Keenan (lead singer of Tool) is singing gibberish at the end. 6. Somewhere-5/5-The most harmonious song on the album, but there's still some "screamage". 7. Searching With My Good Eye Closed-5/5-The opening of the song with a man naming animals and what they say and finally stating "The devil sounds like this" and then Cornell begins singing is great. Really good lyrics too. 8. Room a Thousand Years Wide-4/5-The music is good, but the vocals are kind of overshadowed by the music;  hence 4/5 9. Mind Riot-5/5-Easily has the least amount of screaming of any of the songs. Cornell sings the song perfectly. 10. Drawing Flies-5/5-Lyrics are good. 11. Holy Water-5/5-(No Comment) 12. New Damage-5/5-One of the best on the album. The album goes out with a bang!  +music
Excellent+P+I have to say my fav songs are when Amy Lee sits down at the piano and isn't up running around, she sounds *wonderful*. +music
Much, Much Better!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!+P+I first listened to this CD on my work sound system which does not do it justice.  I was only mildly impressed and was preparing to submit a scathing review with the main focus being "mediocrity at its best."  But then I took it home and put it on a real sound system. VOILA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  While I still contend that Gerald is infinitely more viable as a premiere session man than a solo artist, this second outing with GRP is far superior to "Groovology;"  the former project seemed to be a classic example of an artist suffering from musician's block. "Kickin' It" is the exact opposite - with help from the likes of Jeff Lorber and George Duke, it appears creativity was at an all-time high with the end result being a wonderful project that you will enjoy over and over again.  The arrangements are tight with fresh interpretations, a nice ode to Jr. Walker and some oh so nice tunes in collaboration with Lorber.  Quite honestly, I haven't been this impressed with a Gerald Albright project in quite a whie.  It appears he is finally hittinhg his stride and I could not be more pleased.  Niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiice, Gerald!!!+music
First Melodic Death Album+P+Originally released in 1993, Dark Tranquility's Skydancer remains a masterpiece.  Along with At the Gates, In Flames, Carcass, Death and Edge of Sanity, Dark Tranquility created the genre known as melodic death metal. Everything expected of a good melodic death album is here. Aggresive sounds juxtaposed with acoustic parts, an inteligent concept and growled vocals.  Mikeal Stanne is one of the only vocalists who can sound pissed off and peaceful all at the same time.  Many of the ideas such as using female vocals for different effects were way ahead of their time as well. Can't give a perfect rating though because while it's original, the production isn't very well done and they hadn't quite hit the peak of their skills yet+music
Surprised and disappointed+N+I was not pleased with the quality of this recording.  The McGarrigles are just wonderful, but the sound engineering of the album is a disaster.  The first and last cuts seem OK, but the ones in between are overridden so badly by the heavy-handed instruments that it all just seem noisy!  The piano in particular was so loud that the songs were unintelligible.  I also didn't appreciate the sisters' reworking of several songs I already love from "The Bells of Dublin" (some of the best Christmas music ever recorded).  The sparkle I longed for just isn't there in this one+music
all the drama that you crave+P+Sleater-Kinney's Dig Me Out is not only one of the finest records of the 1990's, it's a pivotal cross-section of 90's music - spitfire women striking independence on one end, vulnerable earthy types pow-wowing on the other.  It may be a masterful sonic assault of punk fury, but it's punk fury mixed with intimacy and fragility.  When Corin Tucker wails in the title track to dig her, "out of my body, out of my skin," you feel wounded alright, but it's in the humanity of such a line and the honesty of its production.  The songs don't let down from there - the sad love-triangle crackdown of "One More Hour," the fury of "Words and Guitar," the sexiness of "Dance Song '97."  This is the moment that a very good band became a great one with the capacity to topple over rock's foundation by aiming for its heart+music
really good cd+P+hes great to listen to, his songs are really good and are easy to sing along to especially manifesto # 1 is my fave+music
Definitely Definitive but Where's "Josie"?+P+While Steely Dan has received the compilation treatment on more than one occassion, the latest "Definitive Collection" brings some of the band's best known work onto a single disc. Also, for completeness, one track each from their 'reunion' CDs are included here. Steely classics such as "Do It Again", "Reelin' In The Years", "Rikki Don't Lose That Number", "Black Friday", "Deacon Blues", "Peg" and "Hey Nineteen" are all included here and sound just as fresh and unique as they did back in the day. While this collection is an ideal place to start for the beginning Dan fan because of its songs and low price, it should be noted that there is one glaring omission to this Definitive Collection - the all-time classic "Josie". Granted, this CD is already packed to its limits with close to 78-minutes of music and is excellent from start to finish. However, including "Josie" and dropping a track like, say "Dirty Work" (writer's opinion) would have made this collection a lot stronger and cohesive overall. I guess this is how the band wanted it because they were indeed involved with the compilation of this collection.  Apart from this, Steely Dan's "Definitive Collection" is a great introduction to the band. For a more comprehensive overview, check out the double-disc compilation "Show Biz Kids" which includes all of the tracks included here (minus the two 'reunion' tracks) plus many many more.+music
T-Bone's Spiritual Sons+P+If you've ever liked the T-Bone Walker style, or drooled over the pure T-Bone licks that both Ronnie and Duke have graced us with over the years, "Two Bones and a Pick" is eight minutes of pure jump-blues-guitar-heaven.  I can, and do listen to this for hours on end.  If any two white guys have got that jump-blues-guitar-thang down, it's these two.  T-Bone is grinning like a Cheshire cat+music
Good stuff+P+First off; I really appreciate artists or labels that give you at least 60 minutes of play time and don't cut out lengthy guitar solos.  This CD certainly delivers in this regard as Ronnie Earl and the Duke trade guitar jams in creative duets for a solid 70 plus minutes.  This is a close 5 star recommendation but it isn't a classic and it isn't groundbreaking; although I would think some reviewers would seriously disagree with that point.  It's just damn good music by two pros whose different styles compliment one another.  Highly recommended.+music
The Cold Vein+P+The first time I heard Cannibal Ox was last winter in my friends snowboard video. He did the intro over the first and in my opinion BEST track on the CD Iron Galaxy. Basically that got me interested in the group and I later found out that they were correlated with one of my favorite groups ever Company Flow.  I copped their CD, but waited a really long time to listen to it. It's pretty futuristic, kind of abstract like Deltron 3030 (another one of my favs), while the lyrical content is nowhere near Deltron (hell, what is?) it is very good. I mean obviously you should expect to hear a LOT of Co-Flow when you listen to this, so if you're not a fan it might not be the best idea to pick this one up. The CD has some very good songs A B-Boys Alpha, Atom, and another one of my favorites, The Battle For Asgard. However I think some songs on here tanked the whole album. For one- a couple of the tracks on the CD are weakly produced, Stress Rap & Painkillers. And a couple tracks seems like they just sorted started thinking of words that rhymed in the studio and went with that, Vein & Real Earth.  Basically this CD is 80% genius, so 4 stars is what it gets-and to be honest I'd like to just give it 3.5 because I feel they coulda done a lot better+music
One of the reasons I hate radio...+N+Nelly is one of the most annoying ignorant rappers I have ever heard. I do give him props on his first album, but he went downhill and started that whole "I can make great club beats, but write bubblegum lyrics over it" trend. This sadly created all the Chingys, Lil Johns and so on. The guy doesn't add any substance to his music, yet he sells millions thanks to MTV. Just save your money on real artist that makes real music+music
CARS SUCK, ACDC SUCK, BOSTON SUCK, AND STEVE MILLER SUCK+N+THE CARS HAVE TO BE ONE OF THE MOST OVERRATED BANDS OF ALL TIME. THEY HAVE ONLY MADE 1 DECENT SONG IN BYE BYE LOVE. REST OF THEIR SONGS JUST PLAIN SUCK. I MEAN WHY DO PEOPLE LOVE LOUSY BANDS IN QUEEN, CARS, ACDC, BEATLES, STONES, WHO, STEVE MILLER, AND BOSTON? GOOD BANDS ARE REQUIRED TO BE DIRE STRAITS, FOREIGNER, GUNS N' ROSES, NIRVANA, GREEN DAY, AEROSMITH, AND JOE WALSH. DON'T READ THE 5 STAR REVIEWERS FOR THIS TERRIBLE COMPILATION. GO GET A BETTER ALBUM FROM NIRVANA INSTED. PS THE CARS SUCK+music
ahh why why why?+N+paul what were you thinking? you do so good on mixtapes lyricly and on get ya mind correct but on this no effort! ok first im a playa taken from still tippin, internet goiong nutz from still tippin all with corny flows repeatative terms but some songs were good sittin sideways was already rammed into my head like a year before it came out so what does that leave you with? surp sippin bugz bunny? what? chick magnet or how to be a player should have been re released instead of this cd! big ballin was pretty good but still the cd is just not worth listenen to buy the paul wall mixtape its got all the good songs and more the mixtape is way better trust me! he needs some new flows! fo real! oh yeah this tracklist aint right atleast with the cd i got.+music
My ears are throwing up!+N+Wack rhymes make me puke via my ear canal. That's how wack Paul Wall is. After I have eaten a full meal and listened to Paul wall, My dinner is regurgitated through my ears. I am sooooooooooo tired of these garbage rappers polluting the airwaves with garbage. This guy wouldn't know lyrical content if I slapped him with a Mos Def CD+music
Give the drummer some; some REAL DRUMS.+N+Kim Waters is one of the nicest persons one could meet, but that still does not prevent me from giving a brutally frank review that will hopefully help him in the future. While I could tell that considerable time was put in this project, that drum machine killed this effort. The music here is so mechanical and irritating from that drum machine, I just can't stand to listen to it. The drum machine cheapens the sound so much that I cannot recommend this CD to real music lovers especially those with decent audio systems. The only composition that sounds like real music is "Daydreaming", but this too is somewhat marred by that mechanical drum machine although less than the others. Kim, please use real drums from now on. You are a seasoned smooth jazz artist with great talent, but you cheapen your production relying on a drum machine. That machine sounds mechanical with no spontaneity. You are too advance as an artist to have to rely on it. It may cost a little more for a real drummer, but you are in a class where real drums are indispensible+music
One of my all time favorite CD's+P+This is an excellent CD.  It is fun to dance to, sing to, and drive to.  It doesn't matter if you like country music or not-you can enjoy Keith Urban's music.  Even better than his CD's are his live shows.  Well worth the ticket price and one of the best concerts you will see. +music
Superb live CD that will draw you in.+P+Well, I have to confess that I had never heard of Chris until I was taken to a concert back in 2004. Of all the bands that played that night, I have to admit Chris really reached me.  This CD has a good balance between worshipful songs and ones that rock. Chris' lead guitarist often sounds somewhat similar to U2's 'the Edge' especially on 'Forever' which really adds a great dimension to the song.  I had never fully appreciated worship songs until I heard Chris do 'How Great is Our God' which gave me a whole new perspective and is very effectively captured on this CD.  Besides those tunes, the CD becomes a must-buy with the inclusion of a superb energetic version of 'Indescribable' and other popular songs such as 'Famous One' & 'Raise Up Holy Hands.'  I had been hoping since that concert that he would release a CD from that tour, and my hope has now been answered (imagine that).   2/06 update: eight of us just saw Chris again in Saginaw, MI and days later we all agreed that it was one of the best worship experiences of our lives.  It's certainly difficult for a CD to fully match the experience of being there, but with the right perspective, it can get you pretty close.  Be sure to try and see Chris on his current tour w/Matt Redman & speaker Louie Giglio+music
Lyrically brilliant, musically great too!+P+I have to admit, it took me awhile to actually enjoy Relient K. I used to think their music was very generic and their lyrics were cheesy. But this album changed everything for me. Matt Thiessen is such a clever lyricist, using enough word plays to delight the wordsmith in me, but also making me think more deeply about my relationship with God and others.  The band sticks to their standard pop-punk riffs on this album, though I believe they use smoother speed and instrumental transitions on this album. Example: Be My Escape starts with screaming guitars and a fast beat, softens down to keyboards, vocals and light drumming during the verses, back up to rocking during the bridge and chorus, and slows right down for a touching finish. There are several other songs that vary in a like manner.  Lyrically, I really enjoyed Be My Escape (but the beauty of grace is that it makes life not fair), Which to Bury, Us or the Hatchet (I move you, but you just wouldn't budge, I tried to hold your hand but you'd rather hold your grudge), When I Go Down (When I go down, I'll lift my eyes to You, but I won't look too far, 'Cause You'll be there with open arms, to lift me up again...). What a beautiful way to end the album!  Musically, many songs stand out - High of 75 is probably the most original song, starting with acoustic guitar, and including a drum loop in the chorus. Other highlights include Who I am Hates Who I've Been, and Life After Death & Taxes, which combines great vocals with some cool screaming!  Relient K has made a fan out of me, and if you buy this album, it will do the same for you+music
boringest band ever+N+I have seen these guys twice, once opening for six feet under, and the other for strapping young lad. And god almighty both times i wanted to bash my head in concrete to keep from hearing these guys. Overall these guys suck even the heavy parts and the melodic parts will put you to sleep. Stop trying to be unearth and opeth and make good music like they do..+music
Average songs, average voice+N+If you've listened to Alison Krauss, you've heard the best.  Rhonda's arrangements and voice were adequate, but nothing special, and I doubt I'll listen to the CD again. +music
Obnoxious and embarrassing+N+This musician, if you can call him that, should be embarrassed.  If he has something to say, more people would listen if he didn't use such vulgar language and stopped talking about his body parts.  I won't be buying this and my kids won't either.  Repulsive+music
Dissapointment+N+In the past few months, I have gotten super into all of Devendra's other works, and was excited for another little delicious surprise like the others when I first picked this album up.  Oh, what a dissapointment I was in for.  The album does not carry through it's energy as many of Banhart's other albums do so well.  Also, having already heard many other versions of the same songs that are on here on his split album with Jana Hunter, I found these to be much more dull, and did not carry forward their emotion in the way that the other recordings do.  That being said, Devendra is always quite alright, if not wonderful.  I find his voice to be entirely charming, and he is generally a very talented song writer.    So, the moral?  If you couldn't really get into this recording, please don't give up on Devendra yet.  I highly recommend "Cripple Crow", his split album with Jana Hunter, and, if you are into music that is slightly more raw, "The Black Babies", which is my personal favorite+music
Wonderful experience+P+I had the opportunity to see Tom Braxton play for an extremely happy crowd at his almamader, Dunbar Middle School (then Dunbar High School). "Julian's Smile" and "Bounce" are superbly played, smoothe and fresh sound. See him live if you get the chance, buy the CD anyway+music
Awful Compilation CD - No Original Artists +N+Drew's Famous Party Music is a joke. I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased this cd. In the past 3 weeks, I have probably ordered 8 or 9 compilation cd's looking for great music from the 70s, 80s and 90's for a party I am hosting. I read the reviews for the other cd's and they were great, but in my excitement about finding Whoomp there it is and Love Train, I didn't check the reviews for this cd. This CD is not at all what I thought it would be. Trust me, THIS IS NOT THE ONE, it's not even on the list. I was looking for Whoomp there it is, and especially Love Train by the Ojays. Not what I got. I excitedly listened to Whoomp, and I kept saying this doesn't sound right. Something sounds like its missing from the song. So I listened to Love Train, and immediately, I knew that it was not the Ojays singing. I realized that none of the original artists were singing. This is a terrible misrepresentation. I was so disappointed! Thank goodness I listened to the cd before I played it at the party. I would have been horrified. I wish I could give it less than one star and get a refund. Please, please, please DON'T waste your money+music
Simply Awesome...Wonderfully Blessed!+P+This album further compliments the astonishing work the artist has done along with the spectacular singing of The Love Fellowship Choir! I must say when I hear the work of this ensemble I am all ears because I'm never disappointed in knowing they will always "Bring it" !!  God Bless!!+music
WOW!!!!!!!!+P+TERMINAL HEAVEN'S ROCK IS A GREAT SONG! Sick Vibration and OVER AMP are pretty good too. OVER AMP has usual weird english lyrics. "She lives by fake slide away".  I highly recomend you get this. It's 12 minutes, 8 seconds a pure good songs. You will listen to them at least three times each time you pop it into your CD player+music
Very Good CD+P+I like every song.  Unlike many other bands, this CD is just as good as their previous CD+music
yeah this isnt a good hits album...+N+all of the songs on this album are very good, however it doesn't live up to standards. sublimes a much better band than this album shows. if your a casual fan, i would not recomoned this to start. instead, i'd recomend "40 oz. to Freedom" thats my personal favorite Sublime album. it may not have all the hits on it, but is much better than robbin the hood and self-titled. great songs, terrible compilatio+music
Well, At Least It's Better Than Brave New World!!!+N+When I listened to this CD I actually expected to hear Gloria Estafan singing on some of these songs.  Some of them seem like they were written for her.  Wild Card has a few good songs on it.  The title track is okay.  Moonlight and King Of Hearts are better.  The last good CD by the Rippington's was Weekend In Monaco.  Changes in personnel, locations, and labels haven't proved to be too good for Russ's music.  He's made his money and can experiment with various ideas.  Wild Card is loser in my opinion, but at least it's better than Brave New World+music
Electric Version+P+This album was released three years after the New Pornographers awesome debut album. This album is similar, but has a more glossy feel than the previous album. The album is definately more polished. Great synths and percussion throughout the album. Electric Version is an enjoyable and easy listen, chock-full of hungry hooks and brimming with indie rock's classic humility+music
Could have been better, but it does still give you the hits.+P+Guns N'Roses are one of my all time favorite bands, so this album is a little disappointing, don't get me wrong, nearly every song on here is great there are just other songs that are more deserving. It just so happens though that record labels never get greatest hits album right, just look at Led Zeppelin's Greatist hits. The only reason the record label released this anyways was because Axl was taking way to long for Chinese Domocracy and they wanted some money, so they put this out, and it has gathered a good deal of money. This Album does do a good job of confirming what all real rock fans already know, that Guns N' Roses are one of the biggest and best rock bands of all time. They came at a time when rock and roll needed a savior, and they did just that, they brought some soul and attitude back in to the music. Songs like november rain, welcome to the jungle, and paradise city really highlight the bands strong points, thus making this album a good starting point for a new fan. I would reccomend buying all their albums though, because all of them are genius, except for the spaghetti incident, which was just a cover album anyways.  This album did fail to include classic cuts like Mr.Brownstone, It Ain't easy, Nighttrain, Rocket Queen, and others and for that I am angry. Also, how on earth did the sympathy for the devil cover get on here, it is simply terrible, possibly the worst Guns N' Roses song ever. So, if you are already a huge fan and have all the albums, don't get this, save your money for chinese democracy it is going to come, there have been rumors of a release before the year's end. I have heard live versions of songs from the album and they are incredible, cuts like madagascar, the blues, Rhiad and the Bedouins reaffirmed my belief in Axl, and I think if this album ever hits the light of day it will be huge. Also check out a band called Rose hill Drive, they are the most exciting band out today and any true fan of rock and roll should enjoy them.+music
Helps baby nap!!!  Helps calm her as well.+P+A great white noise kind of CD.  Just plain rain.  Well I must admit it sounds a wee bit like frying bacon to me.  Whatever.  My babies both nap really well to it.  I recommend it to my mommy friends.  It's been a must at our house+music
Uninspired+N+This record is not Robben Ford at his best, uninspired playing and singing and the lyrics are really at a low level, not a good record at all.+music
This is OK-Vol. 2 is better+P+This CD is just okay. The early JB ballads are the thing here. Gives you a good idea of a good chitlin' circuit performance as typically done for Black audiecnes in those days with approrpiate audience response. The standouts here include the extended version of &quot;Lost Someone&quot; which leads into &quot;Please Please Please.&quot; Even without being able to see the infamous cape routine, it's quite entertaining. But overall, Vol. 2 is better since that CD plays up the more uptempo stuff that put JB on the map+music
I'm Sick Of It All...+P+Ok, so KS has a similar voice to Conor Oberst. So what? What's the big deal? Blink-182, Good Charlotte, and Simple Plan all sound exactly the same, and they're getting five star reviews! Just lay off of it. And, even though their voices are similar, their music is much different, they sound different. They even use orchestras and accordions and brass and woodwinds and... well, that's it. But this is not your ordinary rip off folk/indie band. And, maybe his voice naturally sounds like Conor Oberst's. You can't help that. An Angle are very talented and experiment with different sounds. I pop this CD in from time to time, not my favorite, but it's very good! So, just give this a chance without thinking it as a Bright Eyes rip-off, because that's just what it's not+music
The most eclectic album I've heard in years, and the best.+P+I came to beastie boys on the back of vague recommendations from a mate, not knowing what to expect. Initially, i got licensed to ill, which i enjoyed for what it is, but it was not the stuff i had been recommended. I moved to check your head, and was pleasantly surprised at songs like pass the mic, so what'cha want, live at pjs. Since then, I have been ABSOLUTELY blown away by this album. There is no other album i know of that combines punk-rock, metal, acid jazz, funk, world beats, and hip-hop, in the same album, sometimes even in the same song. And it makes for a great mix.  Not only is this album a great mix of styles, but it is produced crisply, with the vocals mixed down slightly to become an accompaniment to the rest of the instruments, synths blending seamlessly in and out of the music, and the tribal beats laying the foundation for some great songs. The beasties manage to record and mix accordingly for the style of each song style they attempt.  And they attempt a lot. Songs like 'The Update', 'Futterman's Rule' are a psychedelic funk-fest, with tribal world beats as a backbone,synths everywhere and funky guitar licks, i cant help but love them. Songs like 'Sabotage' and 'Heart Attack Man' make for a change of pace, with great punk metal riffs, and fast heavy drum beats. My personal favourite simply for its ingenuity and awesome sound is flute loop; who else but the Beasties could take a folk sounding flute riff, and bring it into the hip-hop world with funky beats, mad scratches and mad lyrics? No one, thats who.  Ultimately, there is something here for a fan of every type of music.I recommend this album to anyone who loves funk, punk, hip-hop, or jazz.  My recommendations are: The Update, Futterman's Rule, Flute Loop, Sure Shot, Heart Attack Man, B-Boys making with the Freak Freak.  Enjoy+music
Ack! I Like Children's Music!+P+I'm ashamed to say that, even as an adult, I love the music on this CD! The kids listen to it in the car and on their little CD player. They are older (8 and 11), so they already knew the lower times tables, but all the songs are great so we listen to them anyway and now they can remember all the numbers. (They go up to 13.)  It's a long CD - definately longer than other kids music - but it has a story to it that follows along with the songs. It's like listening to a book on tape. After years of Barney and SpongeBob (neither did much for my kids' brains), I'm so glad to have something that *I* can sing along with too+music
Exquisite+P+I had forgotten over the years just how wonderful this album was, so I was thrilled to find it here at Amazon! Granted, it's not the heavy black vinyl with the faded dog earred cover, but this one fits in my car stereo, makes the commute miles fly by and sounds even better then it did long ago! Thanks+music
I Am DSGB!+N+Troy why did you put your name on this.  This cd has one good song on it and that is about the long and short of it.  I am not going to waste a bunch of time talking about a cd that is not worthy of being pressed, by the way the group was better with Conrad the Colonel (Ehhhh Hehhh!  I AM DSGB!+music
Cementing their standing as hip hop megastar icons+P+OutKast had been out for a minute but this album made me become a true fan and recognize their creativity.  This album is crunk, it's exciting, it's brilliantly put together and a fine example of hip hop at its best.  OutKast is pioneering and yet so fantastic they're almost mainstream now -- but in a good way (OutKast is the anti-Black Eyed Peas, LOL).  Stankonia just continues OutKast's everchanging shape that keeps taking hip hop to higher levels.  If you've listened to Southernplayalisticadilacmuzik, ATLiens and Aquemini, you probably know to expect the unexpected on this album.  Stankonia is one of the hip hop albums I always throw up in debates as proof that good hip hop can still simultaneously make you dance/groove and think at the same time.  That Andre 3000 is deceptively very, very political, but you gotta pay attention or you'll miss his messages.  Highly recommended LP. Fun and crunk with hidden social/political commentary. One of my all-time favorite albums+music
Moron 5+N+This type of music is like a blister on the brain.  You can't get rid of it and it is irritating.  Yes, this is the problem with most FM radio when this CD from 4 years ago is still getting played.  And the tune to "This Love" is beyond annoying as he pauses between each word.  Moron 5 rank up there with Gwen Stefani and Black Eyes Peas for most annoying, successful artists+music
NIN+N+Nine inch nails are the only band on this cd worth listening to, this sound track is crap+music
"O" MY GOD NO!!+N+Before you dismiss me as a stupid hater, hear me out. I personally think Omarion is a reasonably good singer & one helluva great dancer, but I swear to God that this is one of the worst albums I've ever heard.   This album is entirely deprived of emotional depth & there's not a shred of originality in sight or -more importantly- in sound. You've got love, sex & below-average club bangers, but nothing beyond that! If there's anything that annoys me more than the fact that I bothered taking the time to listen to this near-worthless junk, it's knowing that Omarion's fans & groupies were insane enough to blow their hard-earned cash & propel this album into the #1 spot on the Billboard Album Top 200! That says alot about musical standards nowadays.  However, there are some bright spots on the album that show hints of true potential in Omarion. "I Wish" is a beautiful slow jam about wishing he never fell in love with his certain girl, while Omarion's hit single, titled "O", will have any girl melting slowly as they listen to his smooth vocals, regardless of unoriginal subject matter. "Touch" is also another highlight, combining catchy, simplistic, danceable beats with smooth vocals & unoriginal subject matter (in this case, lust & sex). Then again, most club bangers don't need much substance, so it's no big deal in this case. I personally think this track deserved more success. Oh yeah, better not forget "Growing Pains", a touching song that explains Omarion's break-up with former hit R&B/Pop group B2K!  However, 3 great tracks & 1 above-avergae track (Touch) are not enough to save this album from falling apart. The rest of of this album is utter garbage (to put it lightly), and anyone with at least 1/2 a brain will realize how tragic this album really is. Omarion needs to put more thought & substance into his music before anybody truly begins to take him seriously! I hope Omarion improves if he decides to make a 2nd solo album, but until then, definitely skip this!!   NB: In case anybody's wondering why I bothered to review an album I consider to be so bad, it's because I feel that nobody, and I mean NOBODY, should be wasting their hard-earned cash on such ridicious, mentally corruptive Bubblegum cr*p like this. Not only that, but Omarion doesn't deserve the success his album got. There's obviously many more artists out there who are more deserving of success than Omarion in terms of a solo career+music
Gently Overwhelming+P+Time Without Consequence is one of those albums. One of the ones that you can put into your cd player and just feel completely enveloped by the music. The quiet, gentle intensity of this album is just outstanding. Murdoch seems to be singing/playing so effortlessly and at the same time pouring his entire soul into the music. It is a dichotomy that is present throughout the entire album and it works extremely well.   The comparisons between Murdoch and Nick Drake are valid, and that is actually the first time I've said that, which is amazing considering how many artists people compare to Nick Drake. The biggest similarity between the two is the quiet intensity they bring to their music. But Murdoch goes beyond Nick Drake in the sense that he is not just a Drake clone, and his songs showcase Murdoch's own identity and direction.   I won't go into individual songs, because I'm sure others will review the album song by song. I'll just say that I although I have my favorites, there aren't any bad songs on this album. All the songs are quality pieces of music and none deserve to be skipped over. This will probably be the top album of the year for me, and it is definitely the best I've heard so far. Great music.+music
Extraordinary!!!+P+This album is Sting's prophetic masterpiece, a brilliant work of rocknroll genius with a soul, a conscience, and some of the most powerful, beautiful songs written. In this ablum Sting addresses crucial political issues of our time, and timeless subjects like love, redemption, war, and more, in poetry that ranks with the very best. Like others, I loved Dream of the Blue Turtles and Nothing Like the Sun, but Sacred Love truly surpasses them in its depth, maturity, passion, varied range and lyrical beauty. This is as good as rock gets, and it rarely gets close to this good. That said, "Sacred Love" may make some people uncomfortable due to the issues Sting takes on here, and to the new territory he is exploring through his art. And it may go over the heads of those who don't want rock and roll to challenge them, musically, politically or spiritually. Thank God for artists like Sting who follow their muse with unwavering integrity and let the chips fall where they may+music
Power of Marketing!+N+The power of marketing behind Mrs. Souza is incredible! Her previous album, Brazilian Duos, was listed among the Best Jazz Albums of 2001 by New York Times - a critic, Mr. Ben Ratliff, had received an advance CD copy and included the album on his list, although the album only would be officially released in April 2002...Strange? Well, the next year the same Mr. Ratliff, in the same NY Times, included the same CD in his Best Jazz Albums of 2002 list...Then, &quot;Brazilian Duos&quot; got a Grammy nomination in March 2003...And now, in a few days, this horrible &quot;North and South&quot; CD will receive a Grammy nomination for Best Jazz Vocal Album...No more comments+music
Ahead of it's time, excellence in musicianship and production+P+There is not much to say about this album that has not been said already.  It was the first of many albums that solidified the jump of the british psychadelic band pink floyd into the worldwide limelight, unsurpassed Jagernaut that it became.  It has a very timeless sound, and flows effortlessly from one song to another and just takes you through an unsurpassed journey from beginning to end.  Time, Money, Us and Them, and Brain Damage are my amongt my top 20 floyd songs of all time.  If you need to own one floyd album, it should be this album.  Pallatable to all old fans, and to new ones. +music
pretty freaky+P+this is a well done soundtrack...my only complaint about it is that the violin parts can get a bit tedious...but I guess they are really good because I didn't  even notice them when I saw the movie...so...overall...very good! ...also a very creepy them+music
The Entire collection of Fleetwood Mac's best+P+Fleetwood Mac in the 70's and early 80's were the biggest band on the planet. With a new line-up that included Stevie Nicks and Lindsay Buckingham they owned the music world. Rumors is still on the top 5 best sellers of all-time. This compilation includes all their hits and some rare gems as well. Silver Springs was recorded during the Rumors sessions. Stevie Nicks asked if she could use the song for a solo album. Mick Fleetwood did not allow her to use the song. It was later recorded for the Dance and became a major hit for them in the 90's The version you hear on this compilation is the one recorded for Rumors in the 70's Its almost frightening that a song this good was not included on Rumors. Fleetwood Mac continues to tour and record and still makes great music. This is for the serious Fleetwood Mac fan who wants to hear rare gems, and cant not get enough of their classic songs+music
Back to my childhood+P+Oh my goodness....I had this on a vinyl LP back when I was a very young teenager and nearly drove my parents CRAZY with it. I listened to it 3 times a day for about two years....about 700 times or more...when I was 14 and 15.  Now that I listen to it again, I see it was terribly formative for me, a major influence on my life.  I never realized how much the lyrics interweave through my psyche even now, miles away, years later....Buy this and it will change your life+music
He's back and mellowed out BIG TIME+P+just wanted to say my mom liked this album so he has changed tremendiously. thats al+music
Back to the supermarket+N+A terrible, terrible waste of money. All this CD serves in doing is to illustrate what a knuckle-head Paul Godfrey is. Face it: no one gives a sh@t about Morcheeba anymore, we're not interested in who 'inspired' them, (poor Annette Peacock - has anyone told her?). The next time we see Paul Godfrey he'll probably be asking that age-old question: &quot;paper or plastic?&quot+music
Well Worth The Price of Admission+P+As a completist Gram fan since 1969, the alternate versions of We'll Sweep Out the Ashes, Streets of Baltimore, and Hickory Wind are truly otherworldly.  Well worth the price, in and of themselves+music
This brings back memories+P+I was too young to be in love at that time but I remember jamming to " No More Lies" on the radio. In fact, I enjoy the whole album, and listen to them all except "If" and "Special Thanks" - her squeaky voice cracks me up+music
Glen Ballard is The Kiss of Death to All Artists+N+This guy is a pop music clown who ruins careers. OLP have no business working with him and the result shows. OLP is way out of Ballards league and I have no idea why they would limit themselves to his naive view of pop music. Perhaps OLP wanted to have a sell-out sound, otherwise this disc is a disaster. Somewhere out there is pure disposable pop. None of this material would be on "Happiness" or "Spiritual Machines" How can you go from a concept album from a Ray Kurzveil book to a horrible Glen Ballard. over produced, pop record+music
Enjoyable addition to MI series  Captures the spirit of the movies & show+P+Michael Giacchino's score for Mission: Impossible 3 is an excellent blend of action music and a grat adaption of Schiffen's classic music.  As he did with the Incredibles, Giacchino shows the ability to write a classic score that fits perfectly with the film and stands up well on its own.  Probably the best of the three Mission scores.  Elfman's matched his own style, Zimmer's matched his, but Giacchino's matched Mission:Impossibles+music
this album is the reason I got into country music+P+From the pop title track, a duet with Kid rock protege Uncle Kracker,to the heartstring tug of There goes my life, this album has great range and thoughtful lyrics which are absent in many other genres. Chesney is perfectly positioned to become a crossover star, earning the status  more from his music than his pretty boy image. Aside from the title track, most songs refreshingly veer from his beachcombing, young jimmy Buffet beach anthems that are characteristic of his earlier work+music
REM: gate keepers to the dust bin of music history.+N+Here, in all their glory, is REM: the undisputed Pied Pipers of the bedwetters.  While Michael Stipe's nasal delivery evoked all the comfort of a German Stuka dive-bomber, the whimpering and ludicrous lyrical content became a beacon-call to legions of self-absorbed suburban cry-babies everywhere.  In REM, we had a calculating and maudlin brood of cynical mountebanks who lounged in opulence while tormenting their naive minions with a decades-long barrage of unrestrained nonsense and pessimistic doomsaying.  The embarrassing spectacle probably hit its painful peak in 1992, but it obviously has left a cultural skid mark that will take years to eradicate.  This album is a one star stinker that might serve well as a gag gift+music
One of Elton and Bernie's Best: A Complete Quality Album +P+"Honky Chateau" is an example of why Greatest Hits albums just do not work for great artists. This early Elton John effort is an example of when John and Taupin had some edge and grit to their songs with some western influence. The whole album seems interconnected with excellent music, vocals and words that bond to one of their greatest collaborations. "Rocket Man" was the big hit during the albums original debut but the many of the other songs were virtually bigger in quality and longevity. "Honky Cat" starts with a smart jazzy sound with Elton in a cocky voice talking about his "redneck ways" that jumps and hops but in the next song he steps down and eases into the song "Mellow", which slows up to a laid back story of love behind close doors with a lover that makes him sing in a tired but pleased voice "You make me mellow, oh you make me mellow" and the song does make you ease into feeling the mellow he sings about. I like the sound and lyrics of all the songs but the oddly up tempo song about a typical teenager being morose in "I think I am going to Kill Myself" is spritely entertaining sound of a youth complaining about small transgressions like not using the car then he downshifts suddenly  down in a lyrical sound into a slowing middle eight of "Get a little headline news, I'd like to see what the papers say, On the state of teenage blues", particularly when Elton soulfully extends the word blues into a long bluesy wail that just puts this song in a unique category. Salvation is an almost gospel sounding song that starts off slow with "I have to say my friends, this road goes a long, long way" with great guitars and backing harmonies that is virtually uplifting in a sound that is optimistic in spite of the challenges exposed in the lyrics. "Amy" is just a fun tune that sounds like a young man teased by a wild and more mature woman and he sings with pain and but with optimism in his voice "Amy I may not be James Dean, Amy I may not be nineteen, And I may still be in romper boots and jeans, But Amy you're the girl that wrecks my dreams". One of the ultimate classics is "Mona Lisa" an up lifting song about a tough life in NY city that crosses the dimensions of different type of people, the poor and the affluent as Elton mournfully sings "Until you've seen this trash can dream come true, You stand at the edge while people run you through, And I thank the Lord there's people out there like you, I thank the Lord there's people out there like you" that in the end is uplifting, that he has found something and someone in a tough time and place. Finishing with a flourish, "Hercules" is a rollicking tune about being in love with a woman who is unfortunately in love with a muscleman, a "cat named Hercules".  The song has John with an excellent vocal with backing vocals with a touch of beach boys' sound and although the song seems to end in defeat, it sounds like the man will persevere with a touch of humor. "Rocket Man" is the classic song that Elton used to sing for 20 minutes in concert and it is a great song about a man being a long way from home in a cold desolate environment but the whole album is full of great songs and perhaps this is the best John/Taupin collaboration. The additional alternate version of the western sounding "Slave" is more up tempo than the original and is very good but the core 10 songs are just wonderful and always memorable.          +music
Modern Life Is Rubbish.+N+High record sales are often inversely proportionate to the effect on the morale of the bands concerned. Blur became household names in Britain because of this album, especially through cheerful cockney singalong sinle "Parklife", but it messed them up in terms of moving on as a band: it is also the album which was responsible for singer/writer Damon Albarn's mental breakdown.   But what did they expect? This is , after all, the album that summed up Britain's geezer culture: where men are men and women act like men as well. Where the Thatcherism of the 80s has never really gone away, and it's okay to Look After Number 1 and act like a bit or a moron. This album, for better or worse (in my opinion, worse) is more representative of Britain in the 90s and noughties than anything else. If you're American and still think that Britain is all Hugh Grants and tea on the village green, forget it. And here's the proof.  The album itself is cheerful enough, but totally uninspired. It bears none of the influence from American acts of the 80s and 90s, like Nirvana, Sonic Youth, the Meat Puppets or Dinosaur Jr., or Brit acts like My Bloody Valentine. Guitarist Graham Coxon's love of these bands hardly shows in the songs, because they're written by Albarn. Just tunes, many of which are distinctly ordinary. Even much-lauded songs like "This Is a Low" are let-downs, because they don't display any real savvy for what makes modern music any different from the songcraft of the Beatles or the Kinks. Indeed, Blur are just like a modern Kinks. Just without the great songs.  It's sad that with this album, Blur confirmed what the title of their previous album had said. Modern life IS rubbish+music
bad recording+N+I received the first recording and in the final movement there was a bad skipping. I notified Amazon and they sent me another recording which had the same problem. I received a credit and Amazon said the recording was evidently a bad one and they would check it out. Thanks Billy Lede+music
Not All That+N+Dont buy this CD. I dont know what all the hype is about, but boy was I fooled. The lyrics and the flow are below average, and yeah, there are some weird sounds in there, but the beats are nothing special either. I bought this, put it in my car, and within a couple songs I had to turn it off. I tried the next day, same thing. There is a lot of good underground hip-hop out there, so buy some of it instead+music
If The Beach Boys grew up in Compton...+P+Psychedelia and hip-hop. Those are two words I never thought I'd be relating when referring to one of my favorite albums of 2005. I still can't get over it. What a phenomenal idea. The Boston based rapper Edan possesses more than just an untouchable flow. He's also the producer, programmer, engineer, sampler...you name it, he does it all. The production held within is bafflingly perfect. He's successfully brought the feel of a 60s psychedelic record to the form of hip-hop, including the concept. Clocking in at roughly 34 minutes (as most 60s psychedelic records run), there is absolutely no wasted space. This is an album of epic proportions that rides the line of psychedelia and hip-hop cleaner than you can imagine. It's almost puzzling that a hip-hop record including heavy influence of The Beach Boys' "Pet Sounds", The Beatles' "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band", or Pink Floyd's "Piper At The Gates Of Dawn" would come off as such a cohesive set of gems. But it does, and Edan proves he's the man for the job.  The album's intro, "Polite Meeting Intro", starts it off with some music that could be from Sponge Bob Squarepants, then with the addition of trippy sound effects and vintage English vocal samples, we end up in The Beatles' "Yellow Submarine". It sets it off nicely. Then comes "Funky Voltro" featuring Insight, which includes a high-pitched swooping Minimoog played by Edan, and also a funky guitar sample. Then comes "I See Colours", a clear standout featuring a synthesizer played by Edan. Edan proves to have a impenetrable flow here, boasting some imaginative lyrics that work very well with the sweet atmospheric soundscapes and soothing 60s vocal and guitar samples. The next cut, "Fumbling Over Words That Rhyme", is also one of my favorites. Edan pays homage to some of the great innovators in hip-hop, including Run D.M.C., Grandmaster Flash Flash, Melle Mel, Kool Moe Dee, LL Cool J, Slick Rick, Nas and Ultramagnetic MC's among others. It seems that a lot of rappers tend to make an "homage" to old-school emcees, but Edan simply does it better by explaining "why" they were true innovators, which is much better in the eyes of this reviewer. "Murder Mystery" is a sweet track with some music similar to Jimi Hendrix's "Are You Experienced" with that reverse rhythm, then cuts in with instrumentation that sounds like it could be from the old "Odd Couple" tv show. The next cut, "Torture Chamber" featuring flows by Percee P, speeds things up with a dirtier beat, orchestra string arrangements, and a background Pink Floyd sample from "Dark Side Of The Moon". Then comes the best collaborative effort on the album; "Making Planets" featuring Mr. Lif. Lif was actually the one who turned me on to Edan, as he was featuring on Lif's "Emergency Rations" EP and his critically acclaimed "I Phantom". The production is especially creepy here, as Lif jumps in towards the end at the climax of the song. "Time Out (Segue)" is a tripped out interlude that blends perfectly to the next superior cut, "Rock and Roll" featuring Dagha. Which features some cool crunching guitars in it's very memorable production. I also love this lyric - "My mental fabric / to big for Lenny Kravitz / Who imitates Jimi Hendrix in every facet". "Beauty" is up next. This song is really one of my favorites. Like it's title, the soulful production is beautiful. The addictive reverse rhythm, tight drum loops, and soaring flute makes it a huge standout. I also love this lyric - "I use pens like hallucinogens". It mixes beautifully into "The Science of the Two" featuring Insight once again. This is another one of my favorites (it just keeps getting better as it goes). "Smile" is one of the trippier tracks on the album. He couldn't have closed out the album better, than with "Promised Land", definitely a standout. It's got a very memorable production, and some sick lyrical spitting from the one, the only, Edan.  I see some people complaining about the short run time (34 minutes). I on the other hand, think it's perfect. There is so much filler in today's hip-hop (underground included), that it's nice to have 13 powerful, memorable, carefully crafted tracks to concentrate on. I've spent most of my teen years listening to 60s and 70s psychedelic records, along with a wide array of classic rock, so it may be a bit more intriguing to me than the next hip-hop head, but this stuff is truly unique. Edan may have been paying tribute to hip-hop's greatest innovators lyrically, but he's also paid tribute to 60s and 70s psychedelia in one of the most memorable ways possible; through hip-hop+music
Great Follow-up to &quot;I Just Can't Stop It&quot;+P+For whatever reason I bought this album much later on than the other two English Beat albums - something about it &quot;not being as good&quot;. That's complete nonsense. This album is excellent and it was a welcome revelation to hear it years later, after the fact as it were. There's not a weak track on this CD. Plenty of soulful saxophone solos abound. &quot;Dreamhome in NZ&quot;, &quot;Walk Away&quot;, and &quot;Monkey Murders&quot; are lost 80's classics to go along with the better-known &quot;Doors of Your Heart&quot; and &quot;Too Nice to Talk To&quot;. Love the alternate version of &quot;Get-A-Job&quot; found here. I rank this second Beat album in the all-too-short trilogy of albums from these guys right up there next to &quot;I Just Can't Stop It&quot;; it's certainly a stronger album from start to finish than &quot;Special Beat Service&quot; - their final album - where the strain of not having widespread commercial acceptance sounded like it had taken its toll. Looking back, I wish the English Beat had stayed together long enough to record a few more gems like &quot;Wha'ppen?&quot;. They probably do too+music
John Mayer: New to me.+P+Though John Mayer is new to me, I have always liked the 'soft rock' genre. I got drawn in by the easy rock guitar selections, (especially 'Clarity') and listening to the lyrics came later.   John Mayer...easy on my ears. I'll try another CD. I think this music could grow on me.+music
ouch!! hearing this hurt my feelings+N+I'm a huge fan of pretty girls make graves. Their first two albums really rocked the joint. But I'm sorry to report that this album really doesn't add up. It just doesn't make much sense to me at all. There is none of that old magic which really made the other albums rock here!   instead they've gone for a really lazy, laid back style which doesn't hold yer interest. for example one song starts off with a crunchy rocking guitar riff, which sounds promising enough, but then it disappears and is replaced by a dull bass line and doesn't re-appear at all. They then get bored of the bass line and move on to something else at which point the song ends!! the whole album goes like that. Songs barely get going and then promptly end.  The second guitar play has disappeared to! which means you don't get that cool guitar interplay sound which defined their other albums ( I reckon he was the talented one). They've replaced 2nd guitar with a keyboard player who, i kid u not, puts samples of fireworks in one song!! (I've said enough)  C'mon people! lets have a bit of structure/effort/balls. I heard that andrea's vocals are shot n' the doc said she had to cool it down, so I can only assume they are trying to change their direction or something.. But they are heading in the direction of Dido or goldfrapp or something bad like that.   I've listened to the album about 12 times now and can honestly say not a single one really sticks out in my mind.. What d'you guys think about it?  I hope they get their acts together and recover from this droop.  It's like Henry Rollins Said "If you aint gonna put 110% in don't even bother" +music
Ill+P+This was also a very influential Hip Hop album (Biggie Smalls)one of the best rappers ever classic album kane was the biggie of the 80's nobody could touch him+music
Average+N+I only liked one song on the CD - all others were just average+music
Grushecky's  "A Good Life" is a great listen!!!+P+Veteran rocker Joe Grushecky is back with a new CD, entitled A Good Life. In an age where there's possible instant fame with TV shows and slick videos, Grushecky did it the old fashioned way: grinding it out in clubs and theatres over the years. Starting 25 years ago with his band, The Iron City Houserockers, Grushecky's always been part working class hero & part philosopher. It's a combination that has held up over time and this new CD is full of tunes that will make you think as well as crank up the stereo. Gary Borress, NY+music
2 1/2 Stars- What This Musical Lacks+N+I'm sure this won't win me any popular votes but, this musical is one that I feel I have to comment on. What has happened to Broadway? Why has London's West End taking over the musical theatre industry? Well, when Broadway produces musicals such as "Little Women."  As a fan of the book I had high hopes for the show expecting it to be as beautiful as "The Secret Garden" or "Jane Eyre." But, this musical does not enhance the book in fact it morphs it into some kind of mindless garbage.  The songs are mindless garbage with no feeling, depth, or emotion and listening to the CD is what one Broadway fan might consider torture. There are a few exceptions "Take A Chance On Me" and "Small Umbrella In The Rain" somehow manage to stand out but,are not enough to save this show from a slow death on Broadway.   The cast is dim witted and has little to no connection to the actual characters they are meant to play... Susan Foster who is well known as Millie does a decent job as Joe but, misses that magic sparkle and tom-boy nature that one would expect from the character Joe. Danny Gurwin- however makes a breakthrough apperance as Laurie seeming to be just about perfect and should have recieved a Tony nomination ... I can only hope he makes a few CDs after this show.  It's obvious why when you listen to "Little Women"- how it came to die slowly and painfully on Broadway- the songs and the script lack the sentiments in the book- with no real love story... or perfect ending this musical is a truly tragic loss.  Made for the sole purpose of becoming a money maker knowing that fans of the book would stand by the show- the producers seemed to hope to make a quick buck. But, I will not stand by this show- their is something in the story that could be turned into a musical that fans could enjoy. All in all Broadway needs something more and fans need something else..+music
Found writing in the lyrics book+P+Does anyone know about if the second page of the lyrics book is supposed to have writing on it? I was looking through it and it looks as though somone actualy wrote in the golden box on the second page of my lyrics book. Its writen in a blue sparkly pen. Was wondering if Utada herself wrote it, cus it dosen't look like a computer did it. Anyway it says shishunki in kanji wich means puberty basicaly. I got the album in japan on a trip this week. Just wondering if anybody had any insite. Thanks. Oh and Yah this album rocks. Shes my favorite Jp artist+music
Sorry...+N+...but every song on the album sounds the same. And I happen to like them. Disappointed+music
Some good songs+P+For the money this cd is great.  Some good songs, #'s:1,2,8,9,10 and the NOFX song at the end is great.  Its definitelyworth the money. But if it were 13 bucks I would be so sur+music
IT'S NOT VERY GOOD...IT  KIND OF SUCKS+N+ok i've listened to this album quite a few times and still have yet to find a strong point. i didn't get his first album so i'm not comparing like some reviewers may. "on again tonight" is the reason i   bought this album and it's one of the only songs i like on it. some people who really like this cd will say "don't listen to him". or something like that but i'm right. a few of these songs aren't very well written and just trail off. as far as his voice goes, even if he has range, his voice isn't very good. i mean i like his voice on "beer man" and "on again to night" but some of these songs his voice makes sound worse. although some songs are ok none are exactly good. if you don't have the new toby keith, little big town, gary allan, jason aldean, jamey johnson, or brad paisley album(to name a few) get one of those cause ALL of them are much better than this.  don't waste your money on it...i di+music
Hello, I think that Robin Gibb, this making the ridicule+N+Hello, I think that Robin Gibb, this making the ridicule. That he sings their songs like soloist and don't try to imitate the voice of Barry. That it hurts that Robin, this destroying the great called myth: BEE GEES.      Armando Lobos      Chil+music
Fantastic Album+P+Riot Act should have won album of the year!  Although listening to the album 4 years after it was originally released, I am so glad I got back into Pearl Jam.  I have not listened to Pearl Jam since high school--I can't believe I deprived myself for so long!  Pearl Jam is the best rock band of my generation.  Hopefully, they will stick together and put out several more albums down the road.  For those of you not sure if Pearl Jam still has it, trust me THEY DO!!!  Buy this album, you will be in for a pleasant surprise...+music
Excellent! At His Best!+P+This is Najee at his best. I'm glad he's back and better than ever+music
A Victim Of 1 Disc Band Overviews+N+Around the turn of the century, record companies began to released one disc compilations that attempted to take artists with a ton of output and try to make an 80 minute attempt to capture the essentials. Needless to say, all of these attempts have failed. Great songs were overlooked, and instead of giving a quality overview of the band, one got instead the feeling of being ripped off. The Cure's Greatest Hits falls victim to the one disc overview.  A greatet hit album serves two purposes. One is to collect the best for fans who may desire to have many of their favorites on one album. The second is to provide new-comers to the band an overview of their career. The problem with The Cure is that they have released over 30 singles, and no single disc set can truly capture the best of their work.  For instance, how does a Cure best of ignore "Pictures of You"? It would be akin to a Billy Joel best of leaving off "The Stranger". This song is considered one of the Cure's best, and leaving this off for stuff like "The Walk", "High", and "Never Enough" is an insult.  While "Pictures of You" is the biggest example of a song that is missing, there are plenty of other songs of lesser impact that still should have been on there. For instance, the sublime "Catch", the melancholy "A Night Like This", or even "Jumping Someone Else's Train." And what about their break-out single, "Killing An Arab"?  The problem with this album is that it attempts to provide an overview of the Cure but instead only barely touches the surface. Leave this one on the CD racks and spend the extra money to get Staring at the Sea and Galore+music
OH NO ANOTHER BOY BAND+N+OH PLEASE SAVE ME FROM THESE BOY BANDS. THERE ARE WAY TOO MANY BOYBANDS OUT NOW. AND WHO IS THE WORLD IS C-NOTE. THEY ARENT EVEN FAMOUS AND NOBODY EVEN KNOWS WHO THEY ARE. N-E-WAYS THEY DONT SOUND GOOD AT ALL AND IM GLAD I DIDNT WASTE MY MONEY BY BUYING THIS CD. SO IF YOU REALLY WANT TO LISTEN TO A BOY BAND GO AND LISTEN TO NSYNC, BACKSTREET BOYS, OR 98 DEGREES CAUSE AT LEAST THEY KNOW HOW TO SING+music
I agree with a previous reviewer.+N+What they said was that Katy can't rock just yet because she's a raw talent and not yet coherent in theme.  I saw her live on the Chicks with Attitude tour with Liz Phair and the Cardigans and Charlotte Martin and Rose was the worst performer of the night.  The first problem is that her voice just isn't that strong, secondly, her lyrics never come out as if they're honest and as if they are always a pretension that people feel a cool girl growing up should say.  Throughout her set, there was only one song that stuck out as an interesting and unique thing (passingly honest as well) and that was "Snowflake."  It's fitting that the song was preceded by an ironic intro about how she's lived in California for a long time, but she hates warm weather, sounds impossible, but she must be truthful because it's the only song that breaks out of the leaden grunge guitar mix and hits the audience over the head with songcraft.  I'm sure she has potential for the future, but I think on her next album she should take a hint from Beth Orton who's known previous to her most recent album for being a popular artist in the realm of trip hop.  Stripping down your sound brings the utmost fundamentals of your idea and sound out, and I think that could be helpful for her to put on record+music
A Eulogy for the Living+P+Wow, I just received "Reiter In" and am in agreement with other reviewers.  Chris Whitley has always been a favorite of mine, ever since the stunning debut of "Living With the Law".  I saw Chris on tour supporting that album in Seattle, on a double bill with Toad the Wet Sprocket.  The auditorium was packed with young Seattle suburbanites to see Toad, then when Chris took stage, half the place emptied out.  The faithful, knowing remainders witnessed a typical Chris show; searing, passionate, but also flawed and overly amplified.  Chris chain-smoked the entire show, and said little to the audience, but when I left I knew I'd seen an artist with no peer.  "Reiter In" is an amazing cd-probably for the first time, Chris sounds like part of a band and not just a phenomenal solo artist in front of backing musicians.  Although unpolished and recorded to analog, the band is cohesive, lending a jukejoint feel to Chris' guitar playing.  This music doesn't even directly compare to his previous stuff-it's got elements of Led Zeppelin/The Black Keys/"Achtung Baby" U2, with some Depression era blues tossed in between.  Rather than annotating his impending death with dusty acoustic dirges, Chris gave us sweaty, soulful, life-affirming music, a most fitting end-note+music
An objective Bright eyes review+N+Well, before buying this I had never even heard of bright eyes.  Just so you know my background, I generally dislike indie and Emo.  I usually listen to hardcore and Screamo.  But for some reason I became interested in this band.  (or person) Someone compared a CD of their's to A Death Cab CD.  Me being a pretty big Death Cab fan, I decided to go out and buy this EP to see if I liked this band at all.  This review is the result of that listen.  The EP opens up with the slow acoustic guitar picks of "a line allows prgress"...  A few seconds into the song I am greeted with with drums and an organ.  This song sounds like a slower Cursive song.  The guy's voice sounds decent.  I guess the vocal effects he uses are for emotional purposes.  Overall this is a pretty decent song.  It reminds me of hotel california.  Next in line comes one of my favorite tracks on here:  "a perfect sonnet".  I don't know if it's the simple guitar stum or the sense that his voice is going to explode any moment.  Seriously, the whole song I was thinking that everything was about to fall apart...but it didn't.  He keeps going and going.  It must be his voice that creates this mood.  This was also the point of the CD where I realized that it was a bit more than music I was listening to.  Bright eyes will make you feel moods that other music can't.  It's got a unique brand of emotion that is new to me.  It's too bad this song ends so quickly.  As I press on to: "on my way to work" I begin to get the feel for the CD.  He's almost whispering on this track.  There's an odd sounding guitar picking and a country sounding synthesizer.  Quite frankly, I hate this song.  It sounds like an offkey country ballad...  Who wants that?  The next two tracks are more or less the same feel.  A new arrangement provides better quality music than the craptastic on my way to work, but doesn't reach the level of A perfect sonnet.  Finally, the EP is ended with the techno atmospheric: Neely o hara...  I don't know what to say.  It's meaningless.  I don't see how you can like this.  It's just pointless.  Overall this is a half and half EP.  The first two tracks are good...  But the rest of the CD falls between failing and decent.  If Bright Eyes good churn out more tracks like a perfect sonnet, this band would get at least a 4 star.  Sadly thats not the case.  So I don't recommend this for anyone other than the really dedicated fans.  Perhaps the other CD's are better+music
SMOOTH MOVES+P+This ain't your Dad's Santana. Named for original Fleetwood Mac guitarist Peter Green's breathtaking blues instrumental (he also composed BLACK MAGIC WOMAN), here's the album that rescued the entirely deserving Carlos Santana from endless classic rock tour pergatory. Not since Tina Turner's "I've still got legs" comeback in the 80s has the music world witnessed such an unexpected and satisfying resurrection, thanks to the ingenious pairing of Mexico's guitar guru with a half dozen young disciples, and Eric Clapton tacked on for good measure. SMOOTH, the funky, blistering Rob Thomas collaboration that knocked doldrums-drenched radio on its keister at the turn of the century was the catylist, culminating in the Grammy's most decorated album ever (take THAT, Michael). Since Carlos Santana has always utilized a variety of vocalists (from Journey's Gregg Rolie to Buddy Miles to John Lee Hooker) and musical styles, hearing him play rock, hip-hop and jazz in tandem with everyone from Lauryn (Where'd she go, anyhoo?) Hill to Dave Matthews to Everlast is not such a far fetched notion.  MARIA MARIA even has the Product G&B extolling the virtues of "Carlos Santana" by name in their slniky groove-enriched rap. On the strictly Spanish-speaking side, CORAZON ESPINADO (featuring Mana) sounds infectious in ANY language, and the rest is the vintage Latino rock that this cat was blowin' light years before Ricky Martin was even a Menudo. When the musical history books are written, SUPERNATURAL will remain proof positive that, yes Virginia, there really IS a Santana claus. RATING: FIVE FIESTAS+music
Armchair Anthropology+P+I have seen the movie and bought the sound track. Having marinated my bones and psyche with Tibetans for over 25 years this soundtrack unites two ostensiby disparate cultures, America and Mongolia. As music is the one art form that transcends cultures, it is intersteing to hear the Blues united with their Asian cousins. The phenomenon of throat singing is what you have heard in Tibetan Monks chanting with the  ability to produce two tones simultaneously. Paul Pena, a black,  blind, blues singer from California, copped their gig and taught  himself how to do this. He went to Tuva and won their annual throat singing contest in his category. It is an exposure of the  roots. Like Mongolians don't get the Blues. For any armchair anthropoligist, this cd is a must. The movie will make you cry as you see the challenges that Paul faces, distantly empowered by the deceased physicist, Richard Feinman, who went to Tuva on his  last journey. Paul's trip is peppered with stickers that they  paste up, &quot; Feinman Lives&quot; Feinman was a great thinker from Far Rockaway, N.Y. who collected stamps from Tuva as a child. This record is strange and profound. Irresistable for any thinking person+music
The only classic song is a cover song...+N+... this is a subtle tip off that this album is not worth buying. Not for more than fifty cents.  Like I said, the ONLY good song on here is the Rolling Stones cover "I'm Free". And I even like The Soup Dragons' rendition better than the Stones' original. But the fact remains that the rest of this album is a dull drudgery of a mess to get through. This album is practically a single for "I'm Free", but with twelve extra songs of filler you'll never listen to more than once (if at all). Hmmm. What else can I say about "I'm Free"? Oh, yea... the music video for the song is quite awesome. Its so trippy and tie-dyed out! But that still doesn't change my review. Or stoic state of mind.  One star out of five+music
Great Humor+P+Very nice CD, quite different from their other ones but quickly became my favorite+music
Incubus' most Unique Album+P+"Morning View" in my opinion is the most different album by Incubus.  Their traditional sound lies within rock, hard rock, etc.  But this album is the one with the most chilled-out songs on it.  That is one of the reasons for this being my favorite Incubus album: its originality.    Mind you...if you like this album, don't attain the mindset of "omg if I like this one I'll like their other albums too!"  It doesn't work that way; Incubus' other releases are nothing like this, with the exception of a few songs.  And now...let's move on to the song review.  Nice to Know You--A nice opening song.  I like the lyrics a lot, and the constant transission between heavy rock and slow beats gives the song a good rhythm.  8.5/10  Circles--Probably the one song on "Morning View" that is most like Incubus' other albums.  The guitar in the background is especially cool.  The chorus is also nice, and the lyrics really stay true to the song title.  8/10  Wish You Were Here--My favorite song on this CD by far.  The guitar riffs in this song are the greatest on the whole album.  The chorus is also very amazing, and so are the lyrics.  Quite possibly a perfect song.  10/10  Just a Phase--Probably the song with the mose meaningful lyrics on the album.  It starts off as an easy-going song with no lyrics and a catchy, steady beat and then is joined by powerful lyrics that have to do with going through a typical phase and how annoying it is to go through something like that.  9/10  11 A.M.--A song with a mixture of Incubus' rock and the slow beats on this CD.  This track acts as a bridge between the other albums and this album, in my opinion.  8.5/10  Blood on the Ground--Like Circles, this track is like Incubus' songs from other albums.  Not only that, but this song's lyrics are meaningful as well.  It portrays getting in fights, but not saying anything to the other person (hence "Blood in my mouth beats blood on the ground").  8/10  Mexico--The slowest song on here by far.  This is such a big step for incubus, because as far as I can tell, they have never done anything like this before.  This is why they are such an excellent band: they take risks by exploring other genres, and they do a good job at it too.  8.5/10  Warning--My second favorite track on the whole album.  I dunno why, but it is excellent.  The vocals and lyrics are the best here.  Especially the nice-sounding bit in which the vocals go "We'll make millions writing a book on the way it should have been."  Parts of this song like this one portray a great range in the vocals, which is why this is such a great song.  9.5/10  Echo--My favorite slow song.  The vocals sound very nice, especially the chorus.  The chorus alone is a reason to listen to this track over and over again.  9/10  Have you Ever--Not one of my personal favorites, but still a good track.  It resembles a lot of other Incubus songs on the other albums as well.  This song is basically about putting yourself in someone else's position before you judge them.  8/10  Are You In?--The most  pop-like song on the album.  I was surprised and happy to hear this song.  Again: Incubus is awesome at experimenting with new songs, and I must say, this one came out nicely.  9/10  Under my Umbrella--Also a lot like their other songs on albums such as "Make Yourself."  But the beginning vocals ("When I close my eyes...") sound awesome, and so does the main singing.  Overall, a good track.  8.5/10  Aqueous Transmission--The most UNIQUE song ever done by Incubus EVER.  It includes instruments they've never used before, such as a Japanese flute.  It has a "Crouching-Tiger, Hidden-Dragon" feel to it, and it is enjoyable even for the sole reason that it is different from the rest of the songs.  The vocals are also great.  9/10  OVERALL score: 5 stars.  This is definitely the most unique, most laid-back album by Incubus.  It shows a lot of very successful experimentation as well.  I dunno what all this "selling out" talk is, but you should definitely buy this album.  It is much different from the other albums, and still manages to be one of Incubus' best albums+music
not very good at all+N+The Ying Yang Twins are so bad that it is not even funny. Now if they had talent then I could buy this CD, but that is not the case..+music
A Really a good Steve Vai CD!+P+I had lost track of Steve Vai for a while....In the early 90's I bought "Passion and Warfare"(an instant classic!!)but I did not buy anything after that, cause I just felt so good with Passion and Warfare that I didn't want to be let down by his next releases. Deep inside, I must have thoght that might happen... Well resently I stopped by sony's website, and I fell in love with the sound clips for this CD. I bought it, and I have been enchanted ever since! It's a different CD, but no disapointments. Some fans don't like Steve's singing, but what he sings here is ok. It won't hurt. This is a statement, and I can't wait to hear part 2 and 3 when they are released+music
A Little Disappointed+N+I was given this CD from my sister, who knows I love to dig into up and coming bands.  I was not impressed.  The only song I found to be fairly original, in at least the sound, was In the Woods, which I wouldn't list as the fulcrum this album turns on.  The remainder of this album disappointed me with its appeal to emotion that was trying a little too hard (as is the style these days), hammering out repeated chords and vocals that have that familiar deep delicate sound.  Now, I don't like Coldplay.  I don't have any of their albums.  I hate to say this, but it almost sounds like Levy is really trying to pull off some Coldplay covers.  Make sure you listen to the samples before you buy this CD, because I'd hate for someone to accidently buy A Rush of Blood to the Head Part II.+music
Not bad for a 13-year-old+P+Ok, I got this CD about year ago or something, and never got the chance to write a review about it. She is a really good singer, and that's really good for a girl at such a young age. The first song I ever heard by her was "Leave (get out)" and I liked it a little bit then, but now I really like it! She may be a little too young to sing what she sings about, but the songs are still really good! Well, here it is:  1. Breezy - 10/10 A really interesting and creative beginning to the album! She uses loud vocals in this song, too, which makes it stand out a lot.  2. Baby it's you - 10/10 A great single! This song is very sweet, and is pretty easy to understand in some parts.  3. Not that kinda girl - 10/10 This is one of her latest singles on her CD, and it's a very nice song! In this song she basically talks about what she is and what she isn't, and I really like music that does that sort of stuff.  4. The happy song - 8/10 This one is ok, but not my favorite. The tune is a little too orignal in my opinion, but the lyrics are pretty good.  5. Homeboy - 10/10 Great song, although I never really liked the word "homeboy". But, the tune is very familiar and very pretty.  6. City lights - 7.5/10 This one isn't that great, particularly because of the guys that come up some point in this song and start to rap. It just sounds a little werid, and I never liked rap.  7. Leave (Get out) - 10/10 Awesome single! It's one of the only songs on here that stands out, and it's great to dance to! The music video is pretty cool too, check it out!  8. Use my shoulder - 7/10 Ok, I think she could've picked a better chorus tune than this one, cuz this one was just annoying and boring. But as always, the lyrics are good.  9. Never say goodbye - 10/10 Beautiful! This tune is VERY familiar! It sounds to me like she did a remake of it or something, cuz it's got a beautiful tune and beautiful lyrics. This song can also be used as a lullaby to put someone to sleep. :-P  10. Weak - 6/10 UGH! This song is just soooooooo long and boring! Although the lyrics are always good, this song is just too original.  11. Keep on Keepin' on - 9/10 This is the first song on this ablum that's written by JoJo herself! She did a great job on it, too. The lyrics are just so true!  12. Sunshine - 9/10 Another song that she wrote, and it's just as good. I like the tune also, it's very nice.  13. Yes or no - 9/10 This is a good one too, and another one that she wrote (along with others, of course). I really like the beginning, it's one of those beginnings you would'nt expect in a song lol.  14. Fairy Tales - 7/10 I guess this is a nice ending, but the song itself isn't too great. I'm sure she could've made a better tune than this boring one. I'm into pop and energetic music, not usually slow songs like this!  Overall, cool CD. If you've heard any of JoJo's music, I'm sure you'd like her album. Also, keep and eye out for her new album titled "The high road" coming out on October 17th! I can't wait to get it myself, especially after hearing her cool new song, "Too little too late"+music
They are Missiong Songs from The Movie !+N+I would say get this for the Song tommorow by Saif keta but the One song if you Watch the Flim very Closly was when Ali and his brother paid Jamie Fox a visit in the Hotel and Ali riding on the Train  , That Track was By Johnny Farmer a Old school Blues song Called Death Letter , with Great vocals this song is not on Soundtrack "why? It is the best song in the whole damn Movie  I wonder where I can get it like it was song in the Movie ? if you know let me know +music
Simply the Best+P+I don't have much to add.  If you love Seger, get this CD.  LOVE IT+music
Technicial Blunder+N+I cannot imagine what Sony or their sad, sad technicians were thinking - or NOT thinking when they "remastered" this great musical.  I HOPE - and one can only hope - whomever it was that "remastered" this music (and I can't imagine why they would call it re-MASTERED) that they got FIRED afterwards or went back to basic recording school.  MASTERING a musical CD means that you check your levels and balance - something they either forgot to do or were too busy talking while they should have been listening to what they were doing.  Did Sony imagine they'd be able to sell this on it's own merits...that being an attractive, well known, sell-able music CD of a charming musical - while duping the buying public (sadly ME included) that it would be something worth having for any Broadway music collection??  Well I was most assuredly fooled.  Even with my cheap (Sony by the way) 2 track tape deck could have come up with better than this rendition.  I just cannot abide that some highly technical "master" of recording equipment couldn't fix this before the thing was committed to a glass cd master to be cut in quantity, offered and distributed as a "remastered" version that SHOULD have been BETTER than the original but sadly isn't even close.  I thankfully, still have a cassette tape version of this musical from when it was first released many years ago and prefer that to this impossible display of cd "mastering" I have EVER heard - and I've heard a lot of quality remastered CD's - but this isn't one of them.  THE ONLY saving grace of this CD is some of the extras that have been included.  But not at full price..if you ask me.  Think twice or at least understand at the outset what you're getting....a very poorly "rekindled - NOT remastered" CD that has some singers sounding as if the "technicians" forgot to bring up the volume on those tracks.  Pretty sad, pretty sad.  Disappointing.  Love the musical - HATE the lousy CD+music
Another Great Recording, Keep on Playin!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!+P+A recent Rolling Stone issue listed the 100 greatest guitarists and omitted this fine(probably 1 of 10 or so, blues greats) performer. Though it is hard to be totally objective as I have both seen and met this great guy on a few occasions, there really is no one who plays as well or has this TONE. He is a fantastic blues and jazz virtuoso, and is certainly headed for greater recognition. I prefer his own writing and that is what kept me from giving this 5 stars as there are a couple of covers included here that are not of the same caliber. Thank you, Robben for another very good recording/perfomance+music
Sour Cream+N+32 years ago I was so stoked that Clapton was finally coming out with a new album, I walked five miles to Deorsey's Records in Lewiston, Maine the day that it was released to buy this much anticipated record. The still near virgin vinyl remains in my LP collection and has only been played once. Once was enough. Heroin robbed a true master of his creativeness, inspiration and technical ability. Sad.+music
Very disappointed+N+Watched the movie on DVD, loved it so much I immediately got on-line and bought the soundtrack.  One of the things I liked about the movie is the juxtaposition of ballroom music and hiphop.  The soundtrack for this movie about ballroom dancing does not have a single track of the ballroom music on it!  What's up with that?+music
A review and a question+P+First my review:  The recorded legacy of MJH falls into roughly five categories.   (1) his early 1928 recordings on the OKEH label which comprise around 20 tracks. Although they are quite listenable and of historical interest and importance they are not the most enjoyable of his recordings. (2) recordings from 1963 that are available on the Rounder label. The sound quality of these recordings is somewhat disappointing. For that reason alone I don't listen to them much except for the fact that they were heavily relied upon by people who transcribed his songs for instructional materials. (3) The Library of Congress recordings (also from 1963). These are perhaps the best. The sound quality is excellent and there is an informality to the sessions which makes it like having MJH as a house guest for the weekend determined to play you every song he knows. (4) The (these) Vanguard Recordings, which I think were recorded between 1967 and 1969. These rival and sometimes surpass the Library of Congress Recordings as far as the material goes. There is also a palpable sadness as you can detect a man near the end of his life aware of the fact that he may very well be making his final recordings. The audio engineers did a terrible job at Vanguard for a good deal of these recordings. How can you screw up recording just one guy with a guitar? If you try hard enough you can set the levels WAY off. That is how. (5) there is also a Live MJH CD from Vanguard. It's sound quality is pretty good and it is endearing to hear MJH talk to an audience, but I find it less compelling material wise than the studio recordings.  Listening to MJH makes you want to piick up the guitar and learn to play like him. The good thing about this is that if you really want to you probably can. Many of his songs have been transcribed and broken down in intructional books and DVDs. After going through a "beginning fingerpicking" DVD by Stefan Grossman you are probably ready to take on MJH.  Go for it!  And now for my question:  It's not obvious to me from the Vanguard website whether the boxed set is actually a newer digital remaster than the original digital re-masters from the mid 80s. As far as digital remasters go those ones were a bit of a disaster. When you put the disc into your player you would have to crank the volume on your stereo. As you might expect, the careless lack of attention to levels setting in the remastering process resulted in a mushy sounding guitar. I seem to remember that was also a problem with the vinyl Vanguard LPs, particularly the first one. Hopefully these CDs really  are *new* remasters because most CDs re-mastered these days are remastered quite well.  My music management software for encoding MP3s has the capability of looking up CDs in an online database. Whenever I present it with copies of the old mid 1980s vanguard CDs it recognizes them as possibly being from the boxed set, so I hesitate to spring for the "new remasters" without really knowing if they are indeed recently remastered. Perhaps someone else could clear this up+music
Pop Rock Gem!+P+It continues to amaze me to find "new" musicians who record in bedroom studios all across the country. Everyone was amazed when Craig Chaquico pulled this off, Roger takes it to the next level. The closest event I can recall to this release is Steely Dan's 1972 "Can't Buy a Thrill" that put pop/rock on its ear. The influences are many and varied...Beach Boys, Beatles, Osmonds, Neil Sedaka, Jimmy Webb, The Who, Styx, Yes, Chicago, Alan Parsons, ELO/Jeff Lynn, Astrud Giberto, Wondermints, Burt Bacharach, Supertramp, 60's Brit Pop, the list goes on... As for Roger's vocal ability, he's no Bocelli, but he is better than 90% of the front men out there.  He has a unique "honey" styled voice with a smoothness not often heard these days (think Joseph Williams, David Pack, Donnie Osmond, Gerry Beckley).  He doesn't try to imitate anyone, and has learned to be comfortable using his instrument as intended and well trained.  Primarily a keyboardist, his chops on guitars and drums are commendable as well.  Can't think of enough good things to say about this artist.  Not every cut is excellent, but eight of eleven are standouts and addictive.  The three deleted cuts from Solid State Warrior make for eleven very strong songs that could all be at home on the top 40...during some point of time. Buy this CD Now+music
Can't sit still+P+If this music doesn't make you get out of your chair, nothing will!  Not only are the CDs filled with big hits, but even the less widely known tunes will get your heart pounding.  Great for reminiscing, great for exercising, great for making work go faster...just GREAT+music
Not for Audiophiles+N+If you're not anal about sound quality then please skip this review.   That said, this DTS disc sounds terrible. Why?   1- If you're even vaguely familiar with this album or the songs, you will hardly recognize them here. The multi-channel mix is way out of phase from the original stereo mix; in other words, they sound totally different from each other.   2- This disc doesn't have the fidelity of the SONY re-mastered Abraxas. The tape hiss is very noticeable, and the overall sound is very dull. Just compare this disc with the newer re-mastered version and you will hear the difference immediatley.  Save your money and "maybe" someday SONY will release a multi-channel SACD from the same source as the rather excellent re-mastered cd+music
Sweetest melody even for me+P+Borrowed one from library, love it, so does my son+music
It sucks+N+It sucks, she sucks. OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOo big suprise.  She might as well just cry, cause that is what every sane person that listens to this crap will d+music
Such an awesome musical, but it wasn't the cast I saw, but a great soundtrack!+P+I loved this musical when I went to see it in late March of 2006. But unforutunately the only reason why I didn't give this 5 stars is because this soundtrack doesn't have exactly what I saw on stage, and I loved that better. This is an awesome soundtrack though.  When I went to see this musical, only 3 members of the original cast were still on the play: Norbert Leo Butz as "Freddy," Joanna Gleason as "Muriel," and Gregory Jbara as "Andre." But, that night I went to see it, Gergory Jbara was substituted by Dennis Parlato, so I really only saw 2 original cast members.  Normally when you see a musical on stage or on film for the first time, you don't really get the "entire" taste of the music part because you have to concentrate on the story, the characters, and what's going on and what you're looking at. Sometimes its even hard to remember the music you heard until you listen to it again without visual aid, unless the performance of the songs were very memorable. And the song that really stuck out here was Norbert's performance of "Great Big Stuff." His physical comedy and every single word rang with crass wit that was over the top and just begs you for more. Norbert Leo Butz plays "Freddy Benson" by the way.  When I saw the play, Johnathan Pryce was playing the part of "Laurence Jameson." And Pryce is an actual British person, which kind of made his role more believable. His voice really fit the part. John Lithgow at times appears to lose his accent in the soundtrack. John Lithgow isn't bad for the part though, and when he has to impersonate an Austrian Doctor, he does an over the top job.   Dennis Parlato (Jbara's substitute) I believe did a better job at playing a Frenchman. His accent seemed less forced than Gregory's here. Gregory brings a much more "snooty" personality to Andre than Dennis did. Maybe that's what was originally intended perhaps.  Mylinda Hall played Jolene Oaks when I saw it, and in my opinion she did a far more fantastic job than Sara Gettelfinger. Sara sounds a bit too "mature" and a little older too. Jolene is supposed to be young, dumb, and full of fun!  Now Sherie Rene Scott does a fantastic job at playing "Christine Colgate" and better than Rachel York, the girl I saw. Rachel York was good, but Sherie does a good job at being a ditz, like Christine is supposed to be. She hits those high notes with ease and gives a nice flair of innocence in her role.  "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" is a great musical adaptation to a movie, and I believe that you can buy the soundtrack before seeing the play but vice versa. However, if you are listening to the soundtrack before seeing the play, you better take "A Message from John Lithgow" very seriously because you won't enjoy the play as much if you see it after listening to the soundtrack. So do what John Lithgow says!  +music
This CD sucks!+N+No melody, no rhythm; just noise. I'm heading to the used CD store with it as soon as I can. I'd rate it zero stars if I coul+music
It Will Never Get Better Than This+P+Musical genius to the limit. It Ain't No Use it the most beautiful song ever written - I have listened to this over and over and over again for years, and will continue to do so.+music
Why are they so overrated????????????????+N+Led Zeppelin were simply the most overrated band of all time who were just as bad as NIRVANA and ACDC. They only made about a decent song in "Stairway To Heaven". Rest of the songs just STINK!!! Plant sounds more like a big monkey than a real singer and can't sing at all, HE JUST SCREAMS. Like good singers??????? I recommend go with Foreigner, Dire Straits who were equally the greatest bands with the greatest singers in LOU GRAMM, and MARK KNOPFLER. They are a billion times better than LED ZEPPELIN. Don't listen to the five star reviewers of this page, avoid this piece of junk and go with Foreigner insted. They are legends, not ZEPPELIN!!+music
From The Get-Go...+P+"Hey hey mama, said the way you move, Gonna make you sweat gonna mak you groove..." is the opening line to an epic album if there ever was one.  I can not imagine how to sit down and write a song like a Led Zepplin song. To create a song with the charge of "Rock and Roll", or the lyrics to "Battle of Evermore", to create something like these epic songs is something that beyond me; and as for "Stairway" I think that's beyond any of us mortals. The popular "Stairway" had a seemingly unreal start when one day Robert Plant had a pencil and paper and Jimmy Page was just strumming when Plant described it as "my hand just started writing out the words. I just sat there and looked at them and almost leapt out of my seat." The song has gone on to capture immortality in the music world and is the most frequently played song in American history, which is pretty good seeing how it was never released as an actual single. But it is not just a Zepplin CD with "stairway" on it. It is has so much to offer in every track.  I have grown up with these songs, and if you've ever seen a Ford commercial or just listened to the radio, chances are that you have had these songs in your head one way or another even if you don't know who Led Zepplin is. But the one song that has always unrightfully gone in the shadows of "Stairway" is "When the Levee Breaks". I always personally found "Levee" as the strongest song in Zoso; but i dare not compare two songs of their caliber. But "Levee" brings this epic Album to an extraordinary close. After every listen, I find it hard to believe that there is only Eight tracks, because it sucks you into a world of enormous sound and mystery, and after you have listened to ZOSO whether it be the first time or if it's been too many to count, it leaves you with a sense that you have heard something special, done by a band with a sound that is larger than life.   Essential Recording. No exceptions+music
Great album.... if complete+N+This is one of the seminal albums of the Two-Tone movement, but don't buy this castrated version+music
Matt Laughs In The Face Of Declining Popularity Of Disposable Post Grunge+N+Like almost all rock bands to have formed within the past 10 years, 3 Doors Down is disposable, all their songs sound dull and boring (their all the same too), they belong in the same category as Creed and Nickelback in the "Lullaby Rock" subgenre. It's this kind of stuff, along with emo, Limp Bizkit, and ICP, that is killing rock+music
WOW!.............................what a transition..........................+N+Ya know, when i heard that mobb deep signed to g-unit i was MORE suprised that 50 cent was ACTUALLY familiar with a group as great as Mobb Deep. I didn't even think 50 knew mobb deep existed let a lone that they were legends in new york. I mean i know 50's from nyc but think about it....new york IS one of the top 10 most populated cities in the WORLD. N-e-wayz....yo this CD is definately different from their earlier works on "hell on earth" and "the infamous" albums. But just because it's different doesn't mean that i'm impressed. Obviously, mobb deep is tired of rapping about things that are real where they grew up and they've given up by signing with 50 to make more money. I mean....it's all on their titles on the list of songs. Does this all mean that their sellouts? Well....considering i'm a mean critic of true underground hip hop music...I'm really not sure. Every artist/groups have different intentions. I mean...with a group as big as this...maybe theres a motive to their madness??? I'm trying to look at this from different points of views. Mobb Deep HAS been doing it a long time and all throughout the east coast and new york they ARE considered veterans of this game. Doing it since what...1993 right?? I honestly think that their trying to win brand new fans of the mainstream/commercial rap radio listeners. I think once they have new fans they will blow up and come back with the rawness that they had on the HELL ON EARTH album. We may have to wait until their 3rd album or so from G-unit. But hey, i could be wrong and maybe their just submitting their careers to 50, i dunno. Nonetheless....compared to their earlier releases this album is pure garbage. I agree with one of the kid reviewers that prodigy is trying to sound like 50. I suggest you just download or burn a few songs from this CD instead of buying the whole thing. There are no more than 5 good songs on this album. Oh yeah and the album gets better at the end. Too bad they wasted their songs as radio hit singles. Peace+music
Great CD...Great Memories+P+I was very lucky to have seen Cat Stevens during the Majikat tour in 1976.  Since then I have always wanted to have a way to recapture the memories of that great concert.  The DVD and this CD of the Majikat tour are perfect!  Outstanding sound quality, great songs passionately performed.  For those who have Cat's CDs, this is a wonderful addition to your collection. For those just getting into Cat's music, a great way to see and hear the "majik" of his music.  Outstanding!!!+music
No shipment+N+I wouldn't mind writing a review on Riverdance but as of yet I haven't received it. It was ordered 8-16 and as of 10-22 I have not gotten it yet. Is this normal+music
At his Very Best+P+I once owned this CD and some how lost or misplaced it. My CD player has not been the same without it. I plan to purchase another of it ASA+music
Is this what I expected or not?+N+An album of outtakes and rarities is an odd thing.  Obviously, the songs weren't good enough to make the album they were originally intended for.  Either that or the artist felt they didn't fit right.  So how does one go about grading an album of this type?  It's not easy.  Graded as a stand-alone album on its own merits, I'd give this one a single star.  Marked by inconsistencies and a lack of flow, it's a poor effort that starts out extremely strong and ends gasping for breath.  Graded as a complementary album to "Illinois," however, I'd give it three stars.  I can understand why the songs weren't used and find several of them worth repeated listening.  If i could give half stars, this album would get 1.5 simply because of the overwhelming length.  The respective lengths of "Illinois" and "Michigan" weren't an issue as the albums both contained an overwhelming amount of good tracks.  A compilation like this of rarities and b-sides would have been better served as a 35-40 minute production rather than the 75-minute opus this package is+music
Amazin, Reminds me of the Byds+P+An excellent album. I am a fan of "I Can Hear The Heart Beating" and "Then NOthing Turned Into Somethin". This cd is entirely different. Yo La Tengo pulls a complete 180, and sticks mainly to covers mixed with some original stuff. It has a misty, thematic feel to it, a certain aura of perfectly arranged acoustic guitar and slippery vocals. "What Comes Next" evokes the Byrds, especially their "Notorious Byrd Bros." phase. An excellent buy, sit back n enjoy+music
Please Keep Talking, Joan+P+Joan Rivers is an American original and this CD captures her at her peak.  Clever, brilliant, brash, outrageous, controversial, Joan was ahead of her time but stays timelessly hilarious on this CD.  If you like Joan, you absolutely must get this - I am so grateful to have found it on Amazon.com!  I originally heard this &quot;album&quot; when it came out in the early '80s and have loved it ever since.  Joan rules!+music
Personal and Wonderful+P+Bob Dylan and Daniel Lanois work better together, it seems to me, then many of the other people Dylan has worked with. I certainly like the sound of this record better than the stuff Dylan did with Tom Petty, though I like that stuff too. I actually like this record as much as I like "Blood on the Tracks" and often have both of them in my CD changer at the same time (which by the way I never set at random play with a Bob Dylan record, because Dylan records were meant to be played in their entirety, the way Dylan presented them). For me, this record fits nicely between "Tracks" and "Time out of Mind." Sure he did some great stuff in between, but it's these personal songs like "What Good Am I?" that I like so much and, of course, the way Bob Dylan tells a story. There is nobody better+music
Just wonderful!+P+I really loved this CD.  I am not normally a fan of classical music, but this is more like a pop cd.  Andrea's duets are absolutely fabulous.  You forget you are listening to what is classified as classical.  It is very enjoyable & I suggest all Andrea fans get this one, but they probably already have.  Hopefully with this CD, Andrea's music will be introduced to people who are pop fans & they will start to buy his music & become a fan, as I have+music
What happened....+N+...to the frank passion and energy of her first release.  This is pretentious drivel.  Some call it more mature; I find it nearly unlistenable+music
Classic EP from dem Cleveland Boyz+P+Bone's first official release (not counting the rare and hard to find "B.O.N.E. Enterprise" album from 92 or 93). Classic, not much more to say, even though it's only 5 songs, they're all classics or damn good songs. With all 5 members on here, Flesh was still around, you get the beginning to one of the best groups ever in rap, and in their prime, as what they did was something new and orioginal and everone loved it. Production is insane, like on E.1999, and mostly handled by the great DJ Uneek, who's beats fit them so well, and some help from Yella. A must have album   #3 - 10 (CLASSIC their first big song -- great beat)  #4 - 9 (tight beat)  #5 - 9.5 (tight beat)  #6 - 8.5  #7 - 10 (CLASSIC -- f/ Eazy E)   KRAYZIE -- Anthony Henderson -- b. 6/3/74 -- Cleveland, OH  BIZZY -- Bryon Anthony McCane -- b. 9/12/76 -- b.

Skip this one, but see him play live.+N+If you want a good Hank 3 album, go with Lovesick Broke & Driftin'. It's a more impressive and mature work than this one, which seems slapped together and unoriginal.   The best songs on Risin' Outlaw are the three written by Wayne Hancock, who himself has a delivery and style eerily similar to Hank Sr. So what you end up with on this disc is Hank 3 imitating Wayne Hancock imitating Hank Williams, Sr. And since Wayne Hancock is a better singer and songwriter to begin with, and his performances of his own songs are better than Hank 3's, why not just get the original Hancock CDs? The cover of "Thunderstorms and Neon Signs" on Risin' Outlaw seems particularly pointless, as Hank 3 uses an identical delivery, launching into falsettos at the same time, holding certain notes the same way, etc. I can understand why someone would want to cover it--it's a beautiful song--but at least add *something* of your own to it. To use an art analogy, it's like Hank 3 is tracing over a drawing that Wayne Hancock made, but it is apparent that Hank 3 isn't as good of an artist.   Having said this, Risin' Outlaw is still better than 99% of the trash played on country radio. But I think that speaks more to the horrible quality of contemporary country music than it does to the quality of this particular album. Still, if you get the chance to see Hank 3 play live, don't miss it+music
Madea's Family Reunion Soundtrack+P+I was upset to not be able to find any information on Philipa Williams. I love the song "Look in the mirror" and was sorry that it was not on the soundtrack. Although the soundtrack was nice I was left hanging looking for more. Where can I find this song?????????????????+music
IF THIS IS "PUNK"...+N+...then so is "The Rocky Horror Picture Show". Except that's not entirely fair: "Rocky Horror" rocks harder+music
His best+P+This is a great album, my favourite.  Let's Go to Tahiti, Friday,Thirteen Days, Don't Cry Sister, Sensitive Kind.  This was made for CD, 15 years to  early.  Okay I like JJ,but this to me is the peak.  And Eric Clapton hasn't  covered a single track of this+music
A top three disappointment this year.+N+Kasey's foray into the pop genre doesn't really bother me, and she certainly isn't selling-out either.This release however just doesn't have the same quality of songwriting that her three previous country/roots discs had. Not much more to say exept that this, along with Allison Moorer, & Randy Rogers Band are my 3 biggest let-downs of this year+music
What is with all of these lukewarm reviews?+P+I have no idea what people are thinking here. This is one of Wendy and Lisa's strongest albums aside from Eroica. Maybe people just aren't into listening to Lisa sing, since she does most of the vocals for this album. However, I am a huge fan of Lisa, and any time I can get the opportunity to hear her sing, I cherish it. I think she has a marvelous and very sweet voice.    Some people have cited their first album was much stronger, but I disagree. The first album was way to &quot;pop-ish&quot; for my tastes, and they hadn't really come into their own yet. It just didn't have the depth of Eroica or Girl Bros. Waterfall was OK, but it has nothing on &quot;I've Got No Strings&quot;, &quot;Bring You Back&quot;, or &quot;I've Got a Big Bowl of Cherries&quot;.    And for the people complaining about Jonathan's death hanging too much over this album, this album was ALL ABOUT Jonathan's death! The whole reason they wrote the thing was part of their grieving process. The album is DEDICATED to him! Get a clue!    To the reviewer ragging on the hidden track: That's deidcated to Trevor Horn, who screwed the girls over when he was producing (or more accurately, supposed to be producing) their album &quot;Friendly Fire&quot;. He put it off for six years and then sucked the life out of it when he finally finished it and gave it back to them, rendering it a completely unplayable piece. (Lisa said it sounded like &quot;an Italian coffee table&quot; after he got through with it.) They didn't just throw that track in to be trendy or something, you know. If you're going to do a review, at least get your history and your facts straight. For the record, I like the hidden track, with its &quot;delta blues&quot; sound, and the lyrics are pretty scathing.     So anyway, don't listen to these other yahoos here saying that GB isn't all that good. They're wrong. Girl bros is a GREAT album. Definitely one of their top ones. Tchad Blake did a great job on production, and the track lineup is varied and engaging. Every song has great depth and excellent melody+music
Garfunkel Shines+P+A haunting collection of Garfunkels best. A must have for a Folk lovers collectio+music
THIS CD IS HHHOOOTTTT+P+I DONT KNOW WHAT SOME OF THESE PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT UP HERE DISSING MR BOBBY V'S CD'S..THIS CD IS NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH FOR THIS TO BE HIS FIRST SOLO PROJECT AND TO ONLY HAVE ONE GUEST APPERANCE HE HELD THIS CD DOWN VERY WELL AND I GIVE HIM ALL THE PROPS IN THE WORLD HIS AND A FEW OTHER R&B CDS ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT I CAN ACTUALLY LISTEN TO FROM START TO FINISH WITHOUT WANTING TO SKIP ANY TRACKS..AND AS FAR AS THE GIRL BUYING THIS CD OVER HER BOOK FOR SCHOOL YOUR A DUMMY FOR THAT ONE YOU NEED TO GET YOUR PRIORITIES STR8 THEN ....YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN WORRIED ABOUT YOUR DARN EDUCATION MORE SO THAN A DARN CD..YOU MAY HAVE HATED THIS CD..BUT BOBBY HAS ALREADY MADE IT..HAVE YOU+music
The greatest CD on earth !+P+Hey guys,i think this is the best cd I ever hear.And the songs are sooooo cool! Oh,and I love Michael's-Voice,he is so cute !:+music
The Review of The Century.+N+I bought this album determined not to pay attention to any negative reviews from this site or any other. I have never been proven so wrong in my life. This album is inexcusably bad. Ths following review sums it up exactly.  21 of 36 people found the following review helpful:   Deplorable......!, September 20, 2005 Reviewer: Brendan "Bren" (New York) - See all my reviews  Whoever is the creative genius behind this miss matched MESS of a tribute should be fired immediately from whatever label or organization commissioned this album. Nostalgia aside, never have I heard such an amazing, talented group of performers (some of them amongst my favourites - Aretha Franklin, Beyonce, Stevie Wonder, Alicia Keys, John Legend, Patti LaBelle, Angie Stone) sound so unprepared, vocally dull, poorly produced and karaoke-like! Talk about the right singers singing the WRONG SONGS and then the wrong singers singing the RIGHT SONGS - who had the GALL to give 'Never too much' to MARY J. BLIGE??? And 'Superstar' to USHER???? USHER????? Of all the incredible R&B singers in existence, including the completely acceptable version by Ruben Studdard, you will give a classic like 'Superstar' to USHER??? Unreal. This whole project just sounds like/ reeks music biz politics to me....my baby Fantasia, Im sorry, this is the worst thing I have ever heard her sing and I think Fantasia is incredible. And what da *!@#!! is that bunch of musical MESSES in between - Celine Dion (mediocre)/ Donna Summer (a remix nightmare) Wyclef Jean (unspeakable) Beyonce & Stevie (boring, and I LOVE those two) Aretha Franklin (a la Divas Live solo - all over the place)/ Babyface (boring) Patti LaBelle (predictable) - oh my goodness. Too much. BARELY saving the album by sheer musicality and good singing - John Legend - truly an original sound - Angie Stone and JAMIE FOXX (would you believe?). Still - not the right songs to really make them shine. What a headache...  And perhaps the most absymal act of wanton disregard - WHERE WAS LUTHER'S FRIEND, BACKGROUND SINGER, PERFORMER EXTRAORDINAIRE AND CONFIDANTE ON THIS PROJECT - LISA FISCHER????? Abysmal I say again.  Suggestion - next Luther Vandross tribute - and Im sure there will be in a year or two - keep some of Luther's friends...but please take some TIME to match the right song with the right singer....and some NEW, INTERESTING voices please...do some research - there are people out there who are amazing, unrecognised or yet unknown talents that would complement any tribute....LEDISI, RACHELLE FERRELL, RAUL MIDON, MELONIE DANIELS, WILL DOWNING, LEELA JAMES, LIZZ WRIGHT and a couple of undiscovered underground R&B/ Jazz gems right here in New York, Abby Dobson, Cole Williams, R'kardo, Gordon Chambers, Lynn Lockamie, Ryan Shaw, Sasha Allen and the list goes on and on....singers who work tirelessly at their craft and consistently give great work...  I am appalled. May Luther rest in peace, and not turn in his grave at this slapdash atrocity that does not give any valid credence to the magnificent body of work this artiste of standard has left to the world - as his legacy.+music
This Thang Is A Superb Groove....+P+But I never understood why they didn't catch on. They had a bona fide producer in Kay Gee (Naughty by Nature), incredible vocal chemistry, heavy-duty promotion, and catchy singles. This resulted in an impressive debut. So why the snub? I guess that will always be a mystery. Anywho, along with Blackstreet and Age Ain't Nuthin' But A Number, Pronounced Jah-Nay ranks as one of the top five BEST hip-hop/soul debuts of 1994. And here's why.  It was a very cohesive record, consisting of FIVE R&B entries, with "Hey Mr. D.J.", "Groove Thang", and "Sending My Love" making the top five. You think that's the story? NOT!. The story is how good the REST of the album is. In fact, I will say (like other VERY strong debuts) that the album tracks are BETTER than the singles. And that's saying a lot, given there are only a handful of hip-hop/swing albums worthy of such praise in the 1990's. Those tracks are: "Sweet Taste of Love", "Changes", "La La La", "For A Reason" and "Hey Mr. D.J. Remix". That's eight cuts that should get played everytime it's in the CD player. It doesn't get much better than that.  In sum, Zhane turned out an impressive debut amongst an incredible year of hip-hop soul records. However, their fame didn't last long. They would go on to suffer the dreaded sophomore slump three years later and never release another set. But their debut will never be forgotten. It's hip-hop/soul at its peak when it was still relatively fresh. And that's what makes it irresistibly catchy. A hip-hop fan definitely needs to obtain this one, but a casual listener should as well.  Grade: A+music
Slow and squeaky+N+It had been years since I'd heard this and thought I would add it to my collection, now I know why it has been years since I listened to it, I'll continue with my CCW, Bob Seger, Fleetwood Mac..+music

True Love at First Hear+P+LOS LONELY BOYS, the self-titled album by three twenty something brothers from Texas, is jam packed with indescribably beautiful music that's one part rock & roll, one part country, one part Chicano, one part lullaby and 200 parts stone-cold gorgeous.  Because I'm a big hip hop fan who loves Pavoratti, I don't often find myself in this aisle of the music store. (And by the way what aisle is this?) But a friend gave me this CD and after letting it sit, collecting dust for over a year, I popped it into the stereo on a whim.  What a wonderful surprise.  Almost like love at first hear, I found myself bopping along to literally every tune, as though I had grown on this music.    These guys are amazing singers, musicians and song writers.  Bilingual, they often switch back and forth from English lyrics to Spanish ad libs. Plus it contains two versions of More Than Love, one in English and the other in Spanish -- which reminds the listener of their Texican roots.    Double sided, this CD features 12 songs on one side and 8 videos on the other.  Some are acoustic and reveal just how talented (not to mention charming) this band is.  Because I know so little about country, rock & rock and Mexican-twinged music, it is almost impossible for me to accurately liken this band's sound to anyone else's, but if forced to I'd say Sting.   Not because it sounds like Sting's music, but because it has that same soothing lullaby feel that comforts and convinces you've heard these songs all of your life.  Plus the writing is smart and the rhythms infectious.  -- Regina McMenami+music
Zero stars+N+I loved this band. Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy 10 songs? Are you serious. I would never buy this.+music
not original+N+they just sound like coldplay all over again. do we really need another coldplay band? they seem talented enough to defy this genre, so i'm wondering why they haven't+music
R.I.P. COBAIN!!!!!!+N+One of the worst albums of all time from one of the worst bands of all time. That's all I have to say..+music
Sly brings the FUNK again...+P+This album is one of the main reasons why I don't buy the argument that everything recorded by Sly Stone after "Fresh" isn't worth listening to. I bought this disc with low expectations, but after one listen I was convinced that this album was overlooked. To me, "High On You" is like a more upbeat "There's A Riot Goin' On". It almost seems like this album had the same production quality with the funk format of heavy bass, keyboards, backup vocalists, and driving beats. The main difference between the two albums is the lyrics: Sly seemed to be in a much better mood when this one was recorded. This disc seems a little looser and jazzier too. The instrumental "Green Eyed Monster Girl" is a good example, with a funky keyboard solo that sprawls over the entire four minute track. The liner notes indicate that Sly had a heavy hand in the recording of "High On You", stating that he played "Everything - ?!!". It makes sense then that this album was credited to him rather than Sly and the Family Stone. However, this album seems to have been dismissed, which is a shame. This may not have been his most memorable work, but this is a damn funky album and I can't find fault with that.+music
'Kaleidoscope' is 'Good Stuff'+P+I got this CD as soon as it came out. The song "Caught Out There" was catchy and didn't sound like anything I had been hearing on the radio. Kelis intrigued me with her unique vocals and  wild multi-colored hair. I listened to "Kaleidoscope" so much that I got sick of it and sold it. Big mistake! I want it back and I can't seem to find it anywhere. "Kaleidoscope" is definetly a good R&B album and my favorite songs are "Caught Out There," "Game Show," "Suspended," "Ghetto Children," "Roller Rink," and the Spanish-esque "I Want Your Love." This CD also exposed me to The Neptunes and their signature sound, which is well known by now. Overall, this is very good music+music
over hyped shlock+N+The Kaiser Chiefs are supposed to be the next great thing from the UK. Give me a break! These guys are about as stimulating as a coma. Mundane has apparently become mainstream. I am probably older than your average reviewer, having purchased Jimi Hendrix albums when he was still alive, and gone to Replacement shows in Minneapolis when no one had heard of them but this group does nothing to deserve the praise found in these reviews. I thoroughly enjoy UK rock. I wore out copies of Quadrophenia in high school and love Bloc Party, Franz Ferdinand, and The Music as true progressions and successors to the ranks of Who fans who continue to relish British Pop and Rock. Maybe musicianship is not a criteria to go by but I produce more interesting music on my Mac than these guys can with a full studio of gear. I have never written a review before, but my disapointment in this CD has driven me to this rant! I love this UK revival of sorts and solute you all. Long LIve Rock! Kaiser Chiefs... learn to play those instruments You suck!  For those of you looking to find the excitement you found in the likes of The Jam or the Clash look elsewhere. Maybe the Rakes or Maximo Park will fill the need+music
this cd got me into punk+P+when i looked at this cd on the cd rack, it was only 5 bucks so i bought just for the hell of it. so one day i put in that cd and i was blown away. songs like blackeye, can i borrow some ambition, bath of last resistance, true believers, coming down with me are all great. I LOVE THIS CD. ITS WORTH IT TO BUY IT+music
This CD sucks.+N+There are 2 good songs on this disc, Stinkfist and Aenema. The rest are pure crap. Half of the tracks aren't even songs, they're just a bunch of noise. No wonder Tool won't put any of thier music on itunes or napster. They want you to buy the whole cd so they can have your $14 for like four real songs and ten tracks of filler crap. If you gave this CD 5 stars there is something wrong with you and you should be beaten severely+music
Could be better+P+This is a pretty good comp, but it could be a lot better. For one the sellouts(bosstones) shouldn't be on it. A lot of good bands from the warped tour were left out, and this was meant to capture the essence of the tour.  It didn't+music
The song samples proved me right.+N+I've listened to the samples of this Cd, and I was proved right. This Cd, along with this groups other Cds were emotionless, has no depth, originality, or meaning. The songs like "Without You" are just sickening to listen to. Not only do their voices sound sickening to the point where I want to wretch, but the songs on this Cd are just depressing to the point where you want to kill yourself. The originals were depressing, and so are the new versions of these songs. This is really getting old. Buy something from Joseph Vargo instead. Maybe there is something with originality in it. I'm sorry, but the truth hurts, and we need to face it. Don't buy this Cd, or all of Il Divo's Cds unless you want someone to laugh at you+music
Though uneven and definitely not for everyone, "Adventures" is an influential album that ambient fans will love+P+The Orb's "Adventures Beyond The Ultraworld" was essentially one of if not THE first ambient house album (it at least inspired other artists and (somewhat) popularized the genre - "Little Fluffy Clouds" is a very appealing track). It is, admittedly, a little uneven. If you've only heard the song "Little Fluffy Clouds", be prepared for a quick change of pace. The rest of the album is very ambient and very experimental, but for ambient fans and the open-minded it's very interesting stuff to listen to. My personal favorites are the first three tracks, and the rest I don't think are as fun to listen to as a whole (they're definitely very good, though). It's not ambient in a traditional sense - there's definitely a beat in most of the songs which help keep them accessible. What's also great is how you're essentially getting two albums for the price of one (actually more like the price of 1.5 albums)! If it weren't for this fact and its influence on the world of music, I probably would've given it a 4.5. Ambient and electronica fans will definitely love it, though. Even if most people won't like the album as a whole, they'll most likely enjoy "Little Fluffy Clouds". Highly recommended!  Highlights include: the entire album+music
Vocals make this an unpleasant experience.+N+This album was recommended to me by several different sources, including Amazon and my local record store, which had "mandatory indie classic" in a sticker on the disc.  I tried it out a couple of times and Mangum's voice just takes away from everything else for me.  I just could not get into this "experience" and traded the disc back in.  I agree with the reviewer who says this is not for everybody.  If you can get over the vocals, by all means enjoy this album.  As for me, the vocals were just too much, or maybe not enough+music
Uh - seriously, can you go away?+N+Okay, so now you're on two hit songs.  Well done, I-20.  But that doesn't mean you should be a hit yourself.  To all the people that went out and bought this, I'm sorry but I really can't see why.  You can be a talented rapper.  Get an interesting voice with lots of expression, put in some good backings and you've got no problems.  But I-20 fails here on both counts.  Does anyone else think that he's got the most annoying voice?  That low drone is just a complete turn off and he doesn't even bother to vary his voice.  Maybe a good beat could have saved him, but there's no salvation here, either.  In fact, the key tracks are the ones where he collaborates with someone else and lets them have the centre of attention, only because we don't have to hear his voice - this makes Backstage & Hey Shawty bearable.  But, really, I-20 should take a good look at himself before he decides to make another album.  Feature on other people's songs, sure, then you can still be a star.  But at least then we won't have to listen to fifty mintues of you+music
the best pink floyd album ever!!!+N+who needs dark side of the moon? wish you were here? the wall? animals?!?!?   just stick with post 83 floy+music
Mega Craptitude+N+this hippy master of CHEESE made my middle years a living HELL with his horrid M.O.R. sap toons! How can ANYONE actually praise these corntastic AM gold leftovers from an era that had some REAL music  going on? This is like putting AIR SUPPLY over the BEATLES as a GREAT ROCK BAND---wake up America!+music
not my favorite+P+When I started listening to Pompougnac I fell in love with the music. Some of my friends told me to start with number 5, I bough 3,4,5,6,and 7 the same day... thank god because number 5 was the one I liked the least... don't get me wrong it is a BEAUTIFUL CD and the songs are great but not the best of them... 6 and 3 are the best for me so I recomend to start with number 6 then 7 and then any of them....I have the whole Hotel Costes collection and it is just amazing. Stephane is a GENIUS...+music
VICTORY!?  More like a defeat!!+N+Ok, this was the last Jacksons lp and I don't understand why this was their best selling, compared to the gem Destiny and super giant Truimph.  My father bought this in 1984 and did not even get his moneys worth.  This isn't a reunion album at all.  More like a high tech compilation disaster and Jermaine is only included in 1 track and Michael, only in 3.  Although no video availbale, I love the Mick Jagger colab "State of Shock" (#3 on billboard and #4 on Hot R&B/Hip Hop Singles) which was a celebrated pop/rock celebration and leading single off of lp.  "Torture" was torture and so was the video. Although top 20 hit, it was so horrible that Jermaine and Michael did not join their brothers in the video (although they provided lead vocals) and the later was replaced by a wax dummy.  "Body" was good although Marlon can not sing and the instrumental is a remisent to Micahel's "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'.  Later for the rest of the tracks of the album and being the worst is Randy Jackson's falsetto disaster "The Hurt."  This lp (although I do not own the cd version of it) was a huge disaster as well as their ill-fated final tour promoting it.+music
20 years ago...+N+Twenty years ago, Michael Jackson was recognizably human, and although he was already considered to be slightly eccentric, he was the most beloved pop star on the planet.  And this album, even though it seemed harmless enough at the time, marks the point where things started to fall apart for him.  The infamous Pepsi Lite commercial shoot where he was seriously burned was part of an ad campaign coordinated with this album's release.    It was the last album made by the Jacksons/ Jackson 5, and the only one (so far) with all six brothers on it.  The album was rather hastily put together to fill a contractual obligation.  Michael contributes a couple of songs: the truly horrifying ballad "Be Not Always" and the danceable "State of Shock."    "State of Shock" was a collaboration with Mick Jagger, and it is now best remembered as the finale of the Live Aid concerts in the summer of 1985.  Mick did it as a duet with Tina Turner (and their wardrobe reveals went much better than Justin Timberlake's and Janet Jackson's did at the 2004 Super Bowl.)  And I think I have digressed, but that's OK because the other songs on the album are all done by the (then) less famous and (now) less notorious Jackson brothers.  These are assorted mid-1980s R&B pop numbers, nothing memorably good, nothing memorably bad.  The most enjoyable song, "Body" features the most obscure Jackson brother, Marlon, and also features an enjoyably moronic chorus which goes, "Girl I love your body, so won't you come home with me!" or words to that effect.  +music
In my humble opinion -+N+Guys...it's not that GOOD. I have the album on my computer, and I gave it a few listens, but...it has no substance. It's not interesting or anything new. It's catchy. And irritating, after more than a song or two. That's all ("Bandages" is enjoyable once in a while, I will concede).   If you're looking for catchy and poppy (and there's nothing wrong with that), then buy it. If you want something new and original - don't. And if you want good indie dance/electronica-type music go for something like The Faint, The Bravery, or Le Tigre.+music
Children of Nuggets is minor league comp.+N+This sophomore collection holds no comparison to the more influential Nuggets collections-- Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the First Psychedelic Era, 1965-1968; or Nuggets II: Original Artyfacts from the British Empire and Beyond. Those two box sets highlighted some unknown and early punk and pop rock influences and proved as influential as Harry Smith's folk collection. Not so here. I counted about an 1/8th of the songs decent, but have to ask how often will you return to these novelties? Not much+music
The American Art Song Lives!+P+Please don't be fooled into thinking that Mr. Bucchino writes only "theater" music.  His songs are true art songs that can grace a recital stage.  I have included "Unexpressed" in my recital repertoire.  Not only is his music well written, but it is far from easy to perform and does indeed require the same attention to detail as any good art song.  This album was a real surprise and a joy to hear some of my favorites performed by other artists - another perspective from which to draw.  Just two words:  BUY IT+music
cheap sounding+N+If you like your music reproduced with a synthesizer and 80's production quality, than this cd is for you. Other than that, you have to ask yourself why it was $10 at Walmart as stated by a previous review. (hint: not because it was a hidden gem)I couldn't give this less than a star because of the song selection. That is all this cd has going for it. So read the songs, enjoy it for what it is worth, move along and buy another comp that closely resembles this. (All in that order) Sorry drew, now go back to the drawing board+music
Tommy's Grandparents+P+Pete Townshend didn't just invent the rock opera, but also the "mini opera" when he wrote "A Quick One While He's Away", which Pete often referred to in early performances as "Tommy's Parents".  Well, Wire and Glass could be "Tommy's Grandparents" because this rich song cycle delves deeply into Townshend's familiar semi-autobiographical world which will be instantly recognizable to any Who fan.  From the self-confessional "They Made My Dreams Come True" which echoes the Cincinnati tragedy ("people died when I performed") and the Isle of Wight ("and the band played on until the dawn") to the powerful Mirror Door which revisits Tommy and the Mirror in so many ways, Wire and Glass proves that while Daltrey's voice may be fading, Pete Townshend is still the best songwriter of his or any other generation.  To be fair, like any Who material, Wire and Glass works best on the stage, so be sure it see it live if and when you have the chance.+music
It's Old School, but still Fresh to the death+P+Not only was this De La Soul's debut, it's also a landmark, classic album....De La carved out their own unique path in music and created a gem of an album on 3 Feet High and Rising....They presented an almost alternative form of hip hop...One where it was cool to let loose and poke fun at yourself instead of bragging how dope you are....As a result, they were unfairly labled "hippie's"....  The music on here is top notch...Prince Paul, the groups main producer for their first 3 albums, delivers the goods at a time when sampling laws were much, much more relaxed....They do an amazing job of sampling Steely Dan on "Eye Know"....Some of my other favorites include 'Potholes in my lawn, Me,myself and I, and the funky collab w/ the Native Tongue Crew (A Tribe Called Quest (actually just Q-Tip) , and the Jungle Brothers) "Buddy"....  I highly recommend this album for anyone...+music
Now More Than Ever....THIS SUCKS!!!!+N+I was super excited when I bought Joann Rosario's first CD "More, More, More." Every song on there was gorgeous and inspired worship. I was just as thrilled when I found out she had a new release, "Now More Than Ever...Worship." I heard one of her singles, "God" and figured I HAD to buy the cd when it came out. But boy was I disappointed when I popped it in my cd player!!! The only stand out tracks are:  Track 3: Thanks Be Unto God Track 6: I Hear You Say Track 13: God The Bonus Track: Cuando Reposo En Ti   All of the other tracks are barely mediocre. It was as if she rushed the making of her cd just to keep her name out in the spotlight. I am extremely upset that I wasted $20 on this piece of junk. I thought some worship music would be on here, since the title of the cd is "Worship," but don't be mislead by this fanciful cover and her pretty face. She should've waited until she had something solid to record instead of making this crappy attempt at music. Joann has indeed hit the dreaded sophomoric slump. I highly doubt that I'd buy anything else she sings. What was Fred Hammond thinking by showcasing her if he knew she was average talent? It's best to burn these songs from someone who already has the cd. The entire cd lacks the anointing. Even the bonus video clip on the installed media player, that features Joann and Donnie McClurkin sucks. All she does is add libs in Spanish, plays some maracas, some castanets and God knows what else and I'm supposed to bust a move to this?! NO WAY!!!   Two thumbs WAY, WAY DOWN!!!  A feeble effort by Joann. This will definitely leave a sour taste in your mouth, as it did mine.+music
I Listened, Mouth Agape+P+Wire was a blassed anomaly in the punk world, denying all attempts to categorize them as anything but brilliant.  &quot;Artpunk&quot;? nah...  &quot;Progpunk&quot;? nope...  See, nothing works.  Amazing &amp; very influential stuff.  REM &amp; the Minutemen both have publicly praised the genre-bending work of Wire+music
Average at Best+N+The Corrs are good at what they do..Trad-orientated pop, but on this album, I feel that they have lost their way a little. Always difficult to follow a 'Talk On Corners', but this album is just average,at best. There are some nice tracks here like 'All the Love in the World', 'Radio' and 'Breathless' but apart from these, nothing else really rises to the challenge. Lyrical content is amatuerish with this collection and it sounds like an album that was not as lovingly nourished as the others+music
Clever, girls, but not clever enough...+N+Ok, first off, this is the first Corrs release i've listenend to. I'm offering my opinion without knowing anything else they may have done. I've listened to the cd 10 times or so, on random occasions when i need a break from my normal diet of punk and garage rock.  It sounds good. A little TOO good. I agree that it's overproduced, doesn't sound even remotely spontaneous. The studio work is well done, but OVERdone. I'd like to hear something else to see what they REALLY sound like.  The content of the songs is what bothers me. Aside from being sappy, sentimental drivvel (this is pop music, after all - i wasn't expecting anything else), everything sounds like a commercial ditty or a part of a movie soundtrack. Mmm-hmm.  Track 1 - I see a not-so overweight soccermom smiling on a treadmill at Curves(TM), then hopping in the Ford Expedition(TM), and cheering on the kids at their soccer game with a SunnyD(TM) in each hand.  Track 2 - Helicopter pans out as mid-20's girl drives curvy mountain road in VW Cabrio(TM)(R) with top down, thinking about handsome lover... "LMN"(R) watermark in lower-right corner of screen...  Track 3 - Sad animals. Images of puppys in cages.  Track 4 - Actually, I like this one. Mellow, laid back.  Track 5 - Ugh.  Track 6 - This one is the MOST clever! I see the band members - 3 girls, 1 guy - on one side of a table under a hanging lamp in an otherwise black room, while 3 gentlemen in suits open a breifcase full of money, push it towards them and say, "As you're aware, the radio has lost it's credibility. The kids are figuring out that there are other bands out there, beside what we pump across the airwaves at them. We need to entice them back. If you want a single, and this pile of cash says you do, then you'll do what you can to save this dying medium. Hell, you work in the word "radio" and we'll double what we're giving you." Come on, the song even SOUNDS like a PSA for the International Radio Marketing Council...  Track 7 - Sounds like a Pepsi commercial.  Track 8 - Ugh. Wait, wasn't this Track 5?  Track 9 - Sappy, but ok. Sounds like they actually put effort into the lyrics. Thumbs up.  Track 10 - Not remotely original, but alright.  Track 11 - Interesting sound. Good beat. Correct me if i'm worng, but was that a semi-Pagan reference there? That would be a bold move, for which i'd applaud them, if in fact it is. Not that i'm Pagan or anything, but hey, its a religiously positive, non-Christian reference that doesn't involve Marilyn Manson, and that takes guts. Especially for radio-loving girls bands.  Track 12 - Laid back. Almost has a jazzy, lounge feel.  Track 13 - Produced by former Ace of Base member? Bubbly, upbeat, not too bad.  Track 14 - Written and produced by Avril Lavigne...  Track 15 - WOW! A RELATIVELY CELTIC-SOUNDING SONG FROM A RELATIVELY CELTIC BAND!! And instrumental, too - big thumbs up! In fact, maybe that's the key.  Whatever. Long-winded, i know, but fair. This album didn't turn me off to the Corrs completely, but i don't have very high hopes now.  Flame away, kiddies.+music
lost like alice (or, four stars for the original album, zero for the add-ons)+P+Am I justified in believing that muscular, meritorious pop music -- the kind we shove our hands toward the volume knob for, the kind that thrills us just to be alive for -- is on the cusp of a major comeback, or do the continuous coronations of [...] we've witnessed so far this year mean that we're all sitting shivah for the good stuff and are too stoned on stupidity to recognize it?  The very same signs that appear encouraging from one angle are horrifying from another.  Look no farther than the terrific Anna Nalick, one of a sad handful of artists hobbled this spring by befuddling single choices (let's just say for now that whoever botched the radio plan for that sterling new Dixie Chicks record deserves a daily caning in the town square until no fewer than one of those babbling loudmouth heifers *is* ready to make nice).  Her gorgeous debut album, Wreck of the Day, got off to an okay start last year riding the coattails of first single "Breathe (2 a.m.)," so of course those dolts at Columbia Records went with "In the Rough" as a follow-up (why not that magnificent title track?  Or "Forever Love"?  Or even "Citadel," for cryin' out freakin' loud?!), and of course it tanked.  But then, just like manna straight from the fingertips of God Himself, the geniuses (geniui?) behind TV's gangbusters smash "Grey's Anatomy" used "Breathe" to underscore the heart-pounding climax of their season's most-watched episode, and Nalick was suddenly back in bid-ness.  Top forty was interested again, and Columbia -- ever eager-to-please -- came up with the bright idea of re-releasing Nalick's album with extra tracks, one of them being -- get this, guys -- a newly-recorded version of "Wreck of the Day" that is so balls-out horrendous, you just *know* they're going to make it the third single.  The sorry [...] -- every one of them -- need to be slapped.  Hard+music
Ja is a poser+N+Everytime i try to listen to jah i just think dam it's time to throw that cd out window and put on dmx, his voice and lyrics sound more like dmx's than pac's plus dmx wips his ass at hiphop. It's like jah is D's kid and when he gets outa line he has to be taught a lyrical lesson by his supiorer+music
No computer problems here...+P+I haven't had any problems loading or playing this disc on my computer (PC w/ Windows XP Pro). It ripped into iTunes just fine and then transferred to my iPod, where it also plays flawlessly. I have a ton of problems with DRM software on the Warner Brothers CDs (like the new Flaming Lips album, grrr, which Amazon does NOT warn you about), but this disc works just fine for me. Perhaps Norton, Ad-Aware, or Hijack This! are preventing programs from being installed on my computer without permission?  As far as the disc goes: This is the first BRMC disc I've picked up and after five listens, I really like it. It's a laid-back, mostly acoustic disc which in some places reminds me of the Jayhawks or the Eskimos, and in other places reminds me of the O Brother! Where Art Thou? soundtrack. There's even one track (Restless Sinner) that sounds a bit like the Grateful Dead.  There were a lot of songs with religous overtones (pretty much the entire back half of the album, actually), which was surprising at first but not jarring enough to distract the listener too much.   On the whole, this is a nice, peaceful album, relaxxing without being depressing+music
Not what I was hoping for, but not horrible+N+Well, I was also disappointed that certain songs were missing on the soundtrack. I do not however think it's fair to say this is a CD only for Blacks because it's all rap! That's ridiculous. But, I'll overlook that naive comment & say, even for those of you who do like hip hop, there were some good hip hop songs there that were missing. I loved that song they played while they were out on the basketball courts playing one-on-one (Let 'em Fight?). That's the song I wanted the soundtrack for & I was so disappointed. As for those of you interested in that Lynyrd Skynyrd song playing during the car chase, it's called, "Saturday Night Special." The soundtrack wasn't bad, just a disappointment. To see all of the songs that were played in the movie, visit: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0398165/soundtrack+music
I'm Shakin it ova here boss!+N+This is a minstrel show. Period point blank. These guys set black people back 20 years. Look at them in "black face" on the cover of their album. They look like al jolsen twins. Then the music they make is insulting to every race color and creed. Any music that makes you feel dumber when you listen to it should be banned. I'm calling my alderman now to start the movement. LOL+music
Even Junior Vasquez fails to save this song.+N+I'm not into R&B so i'll skip the tracks i'm not interested in. Bought it only for Junior Vasquez Dub which is i must say really bad. Totally boring. I think Junior should release his latest work (Simone Denny - Cliche, Deepa Soul - As I Am)  on CD's instead of letting us buy only his worse mixes. Very unsatisfied+music
Going, Going, Gone+N+...and forgotten. Raw and ragged. Cliche-ridden. I consider albums like "Highway 61 Revisited", "Bringing It All Back Home", "Blonde on Blonde", "Blood on the Tracks" and hell, even "The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan" as worthy of five stars. Sorry, but this is just not in the same class or anywhere near those masterpieces. Those albums are deemed 'classics' for a reason. That said, I'm not at all a fan of the Band or many of Dylan's love songs so please take these things into consideration when contemplating the worth of both this review and this album+music
It   Really Is The Ultimate Italian Album+P+I heard Dominic perform two songs from his album on Mike &amp; The Mad Dog and ordered it that day.  I knew he was a good singer having seen him perform on the Sopranos but I was really knocked out by this album. I love his version of O Sole Mio and the song from The Godfather (Parla Piu Piano) but what I really love is the song he wrote Song A Napoletano.  It is the very essence of this CD.  The best part is you'll be serenaded by his voice regardless of whether you understand or speak Italian. A great find+music
Summer+P+I don't really like the Allman Brothers. I don't like jam music. I don't even like 70s rock. But I love this album. Listening to it in the deadness of an upstate NY winter, it still makes me feel like it's a summer day at the lake with a bunch of friends+music
Stealing Slow+P+Kate always reminds us of what the best southern music is really about.  In this fusion of southern atmospherics and blues, she touches the heart as few can in shades of country, gospel, folk and pop.    UP IN WEST VIRGINIA IN THE COLD COAL MINES THEY GOT BLUES MILES AND MILES OF BLUES FROM BUFFALO TO BALTIMORE TALK ABOUT HARD TIMES THEY GOT BLUES MILES AND MILES OF BLUES  This may be the best record in her distinguished discography.  Kate's voice, sweet and thick as molasses, is as wonderful as ever and remains center stage with a cast of amazing musicians (including: Walt Aldridge-producer and guitars; Jim Hoke-accordion and harmonica, Larry Franklin-fiddle, Randy Kohrs-dobro, Neil Rosengarden-trumpet, Bill Huber-trombone, Ron de la Vega-cello) and a who's who of harmony singers (Maura O'Connell, Guy Clark, Verlon Thompson, Mac McAnally, and Cindy Walker). Although the blues permeate nearly every song (often in very original ways), Kate finds hope as well.  THE GOOD NEWS IS THERE'S MUSIC TO EASE YOUR WORRIED MIND WHEN YOU GOT BLUES MILES AND MILES OF BLUES AND THERE'S NOTHING LIKE A GUITAR CRYING IN THE NIGHT WHEN YOU GOT BLUES MILES AND MILES OF BLUES  PEACE COMES STEALING SLOW FALLS LIKE SILENT SNOW SWINGS DOWN SWEET AND LOW PEACE COMES STEALING SLO+music
Prefection in 11 songs+P+Like each colored brush-stroke makes a Van Gogh, this song is a masterpiece in 11 songs+music
Disappointed in quality+N+As much as I loved the movie, I was very disappointed in the CD. I thought this was suppose to be a soundtrack. It is not! The French songs in the movie were lovely, this version is not what I expected+music
One Step Closer...To My Trash Can!!!+N+Wow! This is without a doubt,  THE WORST ORIGINAL CAST RECORDING I HAVE EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE!!! Every song is pathetic, thank God there are only 14 of them because if there were any more i would have destroyed this crap! Not even "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang" was this bad (And that was really bad). While I was listening I kept waiting for it to get better, to have some whitty lyrics or a good melody or somthing, ANYTHING, but nothing changed it just kept getting worse.  This crap includes the songs: This Side of The Tracks --1/10 One Step Closer --4/10 The Buck Stops Here --5/10 It Doesn't Take a Genius --5/10 Owner of my Heart --5/10 The Great American Tv Show --2/10 Flushed Down The Pipes --5/10 Storm's A-Brewin'--5/10 Road Kill --5/10 But He's Mine/It's Never Easy --3/10 That's Why I Love My Man --4/10 Panic --5/10 Finale --1/10 This Side of the Tracks (Reprise) --1/10  When I bought this album I thought it was going to be another Bat Boy, but boy was I wrong! Don't buy this disaster of an album you will be sorry if you do!   P.S The little lines before the numbers are minuses+music
Young cats (or Ill-informed) just don't know...+P+The main reason in this review is to express my amazement and disbelief in several individuals reviews discrediting C. Wilson for his cover of "Let's Chill".  This whole album is banging, and for you young cats, here's a little history:   "Let's Chill" was released by GUY in `90/'91, (of course everybody knows Teddy Riley's name - if not, come on now, you need to educate yourself on one of the top 5 producers of all time...). Who in GUY sang "Lets Chill"? Aaron Hall. Who was Aaron Hall's inspiration? Matter of fact - who was Aaron Halls ENTIRE vocal style based on? Who did Aaron Hall himself admit to admiring growing up and mimicking his style? CHARLIE WILSON. It's even been quoted that "...even his vocal distinction is strangely similar to that of Charlie Wilson, a member of the R&B/Funk group The Gap Band".  If you are a rookie, please listen to the old GAP BAND albums, and you will see who Aaron Hall sounds exactly like - lead singer Charlie Wilson. I actually give more props to Charlie Wilson for STILL being able to continue to release albums and make hits, while Aaron Hall seems to still be in that black hole of nowhere for quite a few years.  Moving forward, with the new "Lets Chill" remake, Charlie is really just putting it down just like GUY did, except with the same style that Aaron Hall bit off of him.  Man, maybe it's just me, but I think a lot of people putting reviews on here really don't really know their music..+music
Extremely Dissapointed+N+76:14, Remotion, Pentamouous Metamorphosis...THOSE are Global Communication albums. This is pure drivel comprised mostly of (C)rap and trendy house music that has been remixed. My biggest complaint is that I didnt buy this CD to fill my house with the shameful vulgarities that normally accompany (c)rap music (and I use the term "music" here very generously) and that appear here in a few of the "songs". I bought this CD because the title of the group on this album is GLOBAL COMMUNICATION, not Gun Master Nig*er Bit*h F*!ker!!!   There is NOTHING here that resembles the music that Global Communication has released under the name GLOBAL COMMUNICATION in the past! Knowing that Mark Pritchard and Tom Middleton release music under other names makes me wonder why they didnt do so in this case? I dont expect the same old stuff from them (I was hoping that they actually had something new and interesting to COMMUNICATE) but packaging this GARBAGE into a CD released under the name GLOBAL COMMUNICATION is like packaging porn into a movie entitled  DISNEY'S BAMBI RETURNS....It just isnt right and quite frankly, is SUPER OFFENSIVE.   TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY for anyone expecting to hear Global Communication do something worthy of recording. Through ALL their releases (even the ones under other names) this is the most shameful, vulgar and deviod of anything remotely worthy of musical attention, thought or reflection+music
Garbagehead+N+I could give a long winded review on how bad this album is, but let me just say this... Radiohead is one of the few bands that I fell for all the hype about.  What an idiot I was, I bought this cd and listened to it about 20 times trying to figure out what it was that I was missing.  I finally came to the conclusion that the masses are indeed stupid if this is supposed to be the new alternative or cutting edge or whatever.  The song creep is probably one of the worst rock songs of all time and the rest of the album is totally unmemorable.  Garbage folks that is all this amounts to.  The most overated band of all time perhaps? Oh by the way before everybody gets mad and assumes I didn't give any of their other so-called experimental releases a chance, let me say... it ahas all been done before.  You just have to dig a little deeper than MTV and Rolling Stone magazine to find it.  Don't believe the hype!+music
Faith Hill - Selling Out To Sell Records....+N+Faith Hill has been known (both celebrated and criticized) for testing the waters.  She has never "played it safe"...until now.  First of all, this disc seems like a poor defense and/or apology for "Cry".  "Cry" was a great album.  It may not have been commercially successful, but it was a very personal album.  Amy Grant also had this issue.  "Lead Me On", though not her most commercially successful, was her most intimate and personal album.  Kudos for baring your soul.  This is the function of an artist.  As for "Fireflies", most of the music and song selection seems geared at making sure Faith Hill gets played on country radio.  Still wounded from being eaten alive by critics who disliked "Cry", Faith has decided to duck back into the 'safety zone' and win back her conservative country audience.    The only problem I have with that is that Faith Hill shines best when she pushes the envelope; when she goes out on a limb and tries something distinctive that stands out.  Nothing on this CD stand out.  If the songwriting is at all great, (as with the title track, Stealing Kisses, and If You Ask) the vocals fall short of emotional depth.    I understand that Faith is a lot older now, and she has to compete with vocal powerhouses like Carrie Underwood, and songwriting geniuses like Miranda Lambert, but it seems gone are the days of "This Kiss" and "Breathe".  However... Faith Hill is facing a double dose of dilemnas: "Fireflies" is not selling as well as "Breathe" and "Faith" did, and more importantly, her country audience still isn't quite impressed with the "I-dyed-my-hair-and-hillbilly'd-up-for-you" image that Faith has unveiled+music
Haunting... mesmerizing+P+Loreena's voice on this and every album is amazing - so perfectly suited to Celtic music. The first song I ever heard her sing was "The Lady of Shalott" (played on public radio in NC).  I had to stop the car and close my eyes!  Buy this album and every other album of hers - I'd be VERY surprised if you were the slightest bit disappointed+music
BIG Disappointment+N+I am at a loss to hear what people appreciate about this CD.  We were barely able to make it through one listening.  This is a classic example of a CD that NEVER would have been produced had the artist (using the term very loosely) not already been famous for something besides music.  The lack of talent and originality on this CD is apalling.  It only gets a star because that's the lowest rating.  I want my money back+music
PU...it's Pulse Ultra+N+Strengths:handful of decent tracks, talent is present, cd has clean sounding guitars, vocals and bass drums, every now and then it almost gets exciting...for a few seconds  Weaknesses: they don't seem to know how to change their sound at all, almost no creativity, music is boring and not energetic at all, most tracks are long and exhausting to listen to, could have been much better than what it is    I'm surprised who P.U. is categorized with. Noone else thinks they sound a tad bit akin to TOOL?  I could be wrong...all I've heard from TOOL in forever is their radio stuff, but this sounds alot more TOOL-ish to me than, oh say, Taproot-ish or Endo-ish.  Hard 'n Heavy bass chords, clearly distinctive guitar rhythms and pounding bass drums, that sound just like TOOL. Vocals have that high pitch sound thats too one keyed and too soft for me. All songs seem to run at virtually one pace..SLOW. The music gets boring.   I can't hear where they've broken any real ground or added anything cool, catchy, or different.  I'm just not digging this disc as much as I think I should be.     With a cheap boombox you're likely to miss alot of the low end that makes the music strong and enticing.  So without good speakers, the music sounds even more wimpy and even more boring than with a good surround system. +music
Hits the spot.+P+In terms of nu-metal, this is definitely one of the best albums in this genre in a long time - if not ever. This is far from generic, as some of the other reviewers has blatantly stated, although some of the songs do sound run-of-the-mill and dry in places. Overall, though, this album is full of creative melodies and structures that you just don't find now-a-days in the 'nu-metal' scene. Don't settle for the garbage that's out there, this is a talented band with a unique sound [those guitars!] and a great album.  If you're into nu-metal but are starved for creativity and originality, pick this album up. It's not perfect, but it delivers.+music
This is garbage!!+N+Wow, they actually put this "anti-classic" on CD.  Seriously, this is a very bad album.  Practically none of the "superstars" can sing, other than Jimmy Hart, and they are mostly stuck with dumb novelty songs.  Not that they fare too well when they sing "serious" songs.  Nikolai Volkoff has a decent baritone voice, but his thick accent renders "Cara Mia" unintelligible.  Probably the worst singing here is by Roddy Piper, although Captain Lou Albano gives him a run for the money.  If you are a fan of bad celebrity singing, you should get this album+music
Unbelievably good.  A master guitarist, stellar songwriter and voice to die for.+P+This is an amazing collection of ALL NEW works from not only a master guitarist and stellar songwriter...but one of the smoothest and most amazing voices around (for another voice this good...see "Neil Finn").  Even if you've never heard of Vince Gill, or don't listen to country music - buy this cd and enjoy it (each cd is in a different style).  I just saw him last night at the Wiltern Theater in Los Angeles and he blew my mind.  He and his roughly 20 piece band were sensational.  He performed 5 or 6 tracks off each of the four cds in this collection and not one of them wasn't fantastic.  There aren't enough good things to say about this box set of all new material+music
One good song is NOT enough+N+All of the songs except for ONE are TRASH on this one. Not worth forking over even $.01 for this one!!!+music
dont waste your time+N+this pile of crap, like all poser efforts, was created to make money.  after the 91/92 punk revolution via grunge, tons of bands jumped on the bandwagon to cash in. after realizing they had lost much of their fanbase during this period, gnr decided to try to gain some street cred by covering some old alternative songs and a golden oldie, but by doing so they proved just how little musical ability they had.  all the songs they covered were played in the exact format as the original with the exact same instrumental accompinament.  the old boys from la did nothing new and nothing creative.  but i do have to give them credit for one thing they did right, saying in the liner notes to pick up the original records, how true+music
Gunners worst "album"+N+Back in 1993 I was a kid that really loved Guns N' Roses. They were the best rock band in the world, so I decided to blindly buy this album, and to my surprise....it sucked big time. I don't like Guns N' Roses much now because I now understand their sometimes stupid and racists lyrics. However, this album compared to Appetite, lies and U.Y.I. 1 and 2 deserves a -5 stars. If this album would have been recorded by any other band it would sucked too and it would not have sold more than 2000 or 3000 copies.  My advice, if you like GNR you will find that all their previous albums are just wonderful, but please, don't buy this crap. The cover image says it all it looks like a s... and 99% of this album songs are s...+music
Excellent+P+Intriguing historical account of MacNamara- what he was thinking, what he did not say during two administrations involved in the Viet Name war.  Use of film footage and Philip Glass' eerie and ominous soundtrack further developed the power of this film+music
The Suicidal CD+N+How come the songs sounded better in the movie. Some of the best songs from the movie were left out of this soundtrac+music
Singin' in the Bathtub+N+I dont see what people like about this CD. My 14 month old son and I looked at each other in disgust when I first played it!!! Very irritaing CD dont buy it!!! I am returning it today.+music
Great Disc!+P+I remember that I had the Lifetime on cassette 20 years ago and never grew tired of it. I have always been a big Holdsworth fan and he really shines on this stuff. The second half of the cd I had not heard before and was disapointed that it had taken me so long to discover these tracks. Fantastic stuff  A must if you are a fan of either Tony Williams or Alan Holdswort+music
WOW Gospel 2005+P+This is a nice CD and should provide hours of listening enjoyment.   I had been waiting for this CD to come out and I an not in the least bit disappointed+music
Righteous man Righteous+P+Having gotten his magic songwriting touch back with Freedom, Neil finds the mystic of his avalanching guitar sound with Ragged Glory.  The album is awesome and fits perfectly alongside Neil's best work with the Horse+music
Omarion's Cheaper, Less Talented Alternative+N+Wow, I never thought I would've found an R&B album worse than Omarion's debut until I finished listening to this album's samples on Amazon. "Naked", Marques Houston's spohomore effort, is undoubtedly the worst R&B album I have ever heard in a long while.  I apoligize for sounding harsh, but think about it. Where's the talent? Where's the skill? What about the heart & soul? Where's the musical ambition? What about meaningful lyrics & nice beats? Where's his dignity? Where's hist artistic growth? I'm betting he threw all that & so much more out the window along with his tacky clothes. Marques, take this into account...YOU'RE NOT USHER AND YOU NEVER WILL BE, SO STOP TRYING!  I honestly tried really hard to force myself to like his song "All Because Of You", but I just couldn't convince myself to do it. There's not a single song on this entire album that has any true emotional depth. His other singles, "Naked" & "Sex Wit You" are absolutely pathetic attempts at explicit sexuality, with egomaniacle, ridicuously retarded videos to boot. As if the cheesy, sexual come-ons & emotionally devoid ballads were hard enough to bare, you have miserable club tunes to complain about here & there.  Marques Houston is a perfect example of why R&B goes downhills nowadays. Anybody with a slight fraction of a brain would be aware that he has no talent, and relies on his ugly mug & flabby gut to seek the attention of ditsy tween girls worldwide. Skip this album at ALL COSTS (AND I MEAN THAT LITERALLY)+music
sooooooooooooo   disappointing!!! don't buy it.  buy his first cd instead!+N+i loved marques houston in immature/imx.  his first solo cd was good.  he's a decent actor as well.  this cd, however, does not match up AT ALL with other stuff he's done.  all because of u and naked were good songs (and naked was a good video ;) )  i think there was one other good song - but, i sold this cd to a used cd store about 2 weeks after i got it.  i couldnt even listen to most of the songs all the way through.  boring.  vulgar language.  mh is just trying too hard by using the n-word a lot and talking dirty.  sex music can be classy - but not on his cd.  i was soooooooooooooooo disappointed with this piece of crap cd.  do NOT buy it!!!! +music
Great Mix of 80s music+P+I am a huge 80s fan and this is a terrific selection of some of the best songs from that time+music
One of the Greatest Girl Groups of the 80s+P+During the 80s, the Bangles solidified themselves not only as one of the best girl groups, but one of the best groups overall.  This CD contains an anthology of their greatest hits and will take you back in time to the 80s.  Led by Susanna Hoffs' melodic vocals, Michael Steele's bass, Vicki Peterson's guitar, and Debbi Peterson's drums, the Bangles created a collection of songs that have stood the test of time and still remain popular today.  This CD is loaded with great songs, including "Going Down to Liverpool", the classic "Manic Monday", "If She Knew What She Wants", the #1 "Walk Like an Egyptian", "Hazy Shade of Winter" from the movie "Less Than Zero", the upbeat "In Your Room", and another #1 "Eternal Flame"  This greatest hits CD is the perfect collection for the person who doesn't want to go out and buy each individual album.  All of the best songs are contained in this great single CD.  I highly recommend this great disc.  Listen to this CD and hear one of the best girl groups from the 80s+music
What's not to love about Ludacris?+N+How can you not relate to Ludacris's music? It deals with every day life like chilin in da hood and slapin da bitchis an hos. It's so deep. I can identify with his music so much it's scary. i sure hope one day I can become a musical genious like him. Forget about no-name bands like Pink Floyd, Yes, and Radiohead, they're never played on MTV so saying that they're talented is like saying Ashlee Simpson didn't create rock n' roll! Ludacris-the most talented musician on the planet-is going to change the world!!!                                                                                                           If you took any of that seriously, this album is for you+music
Absolute garbage+N+Tipsy and Hood Hop were decent but the rest of this crap is flat out horrible. This was one of the worst rap albums of last year and hopefully this dumbass won't make another album or will step his game up. XXX wasn't bad but this dude still is a horrible rapper and I don't recommend buying this trash at all. If you want a good mix of party and gangsta songs get 50 Cent's Massacre album instead or even Ja Rule's R.U.L.E. Those aren't classics but they are much better than this garbage+music
One of the Greatest Albums of All Time.+P+The title says it all.  Just throw all the tracks in a hat, and pick out a hit.  So much emotion was drawn to each track you can feel it.  For myself, this album represents tons of memories and great times.  I suggest it to any and everybody+music
Rex Harrison is a beast+P+Great performance by Rex, absolutely unreproducible! L&L's impeccable collaboration is one great pre-Soundheim work.+music
Why?+N+This is not necessarily an indictment of Aimee Mann or holiday music....though I do find such disks as being cheesey. I was a bit surprised when I heard Mann was coming out w/a holiday album.  It seemed a bit above someone who has based a career on not only  original material, but non-mainstream music.    It has also always surprised me that at the plethora of holiday disks that are out there and how many more come out each year.  Is it just me - or are there only 18 holiday songs in existance to begin with?  There is only so many different ways to cover "I'll Be Home for Christmas", "Winter Wonderland" - all of which I believe are covered by James Taylor, Sarah McLachlan and Better Midler, all of which were released this month.  I'm guessing they are cheap to produce and easy to pull in profits.  That being said - I still like Mann's voice and she comes through with 3-4 songs that are above the fray.  "Whatever Happened to Christmas", "Christmastime" and her original "Calling on Mary".  I also liked the fact that she covered "You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch".  That seems to suit her more.  Not my cup of tea - but the songs I mentioned are the reason the disk gets 2 stars+music
funny like haha+N+this review is pretty funny you have to admit..... "This band has the most retarded lyrics I've ever heard - "Sometimes the sun goes down, sometimes it goes back up, I'm wondering which one you are watching now." Huh?? Forget about the singer's gross melodramatic voice or the band's boring decision to steal riffs from the Strokes - just check out those lyrics!! The sun doesn't 'sometimes' go up and down, it ALWAYS goes up and down - ALWAYS - you morons. "I'm wondering which one you are watching now." Which one? Excuse me, last time I checked, we have only ONE sun, not two. Whatever. Maybe these hipsters should've spent more time in school and less time working on their hair. Their first record was trying to sound like Weezer and now they're trying to sound like Hot Hot Heat. How lame is that? And why are these guys trying so hard to look like the Strokes? They even have that token dude with the caucasion 'fro. I was suckered into seeing these guys at Spaceland last month and overheard the singer "pep-talking" his band. So embarassing. "Okay, guys, have fun tonight but make it look natural. You never know who might be in the audience. And don't forget, those fat girls in the front row bought some merch so pretend to be nice to them and we'll make fun of them later." Cool guys." +music
Shooter does it again+P+This album has it all: *actual* country music, a couple of rockers and humour (Aviator).  The music that's on here puts mainstream country radio to shame.  See Shooter live if you get a chance.  You won't be disappointed+music
Great CD/DVD+P+I keep seeing all over the reviews that this is intended for kids.  I am 40 and the owner of a studio.  I have been involved in music production since 1985 and I have got to say that the music this duo is putting out is phenomenal.  Not only is the music fantastic, but the production is flawless.  My daughter watches Disney channel which is where I was first exposed to Aly and AJ's music.  I was blown away when I first heard "Rush" and when "Chemicals React" came out, I was convinced that "Rush" wasn't a fluke and decided to buy the CD/DVD.    With the exception of the two cover tunes at the end of the CD, this disk is awesome.  Don't get me wrong, they have done a great job on the cover tunes, I just don't know why they put the covers on it; their stuff blows the covers away.  This CD is definitely not one with just a couple of good songs; they are all good. I'd recommend this CD for anyone who likes modern rock. +music
Simply the best+P+The cd includes versions of &quot;All or Nothing&quot; and &quot;Dov'and L'amore&quot;. The &quot;All or Nothing&quot; remixes are fantastic, specially 'Almighty Definite Mix'.  All &quot;Dov'e l'amore&quot; versions are great, with a special attention to 'Tony Moran's Anthem Mix' and 'Ray Roc's Latin Soul Vocal Mix', turning this new single one of her bests.  The beautiful cover follows the same style of the &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; collection and the show in Las Vegas, available in VHS and DVD, a must have!+music
Lang is fresh+P+Jeff Lang gives a fresh and personal voice to the blues.  Another reviewer complains that he isn't Son House or Robert Johnson and so forth.  Yeah, this is what... 60 years later?  A blues fan for many years, I get tired of guys that can't look beyond their dusty old records and nostalgia for an era that they didn't live in and perhaps didn't quite exist.  Son House is fine, but he had limited musical talent.  Jeff is not only technically talented, he brings a fresh personal message into a style that has too long suffered from a lack of innovation+music
Retarded & Gross+N+This band has the most retarded lyrics I've ever heard - "Sometimes the sun goes down, sometimes it goes back up, I'm wondering which one you are watching now."  Huh??  Forget about the singer's gross melodramatic voice or the band's boring decision to steal riffs from the Strokes - just check out those lyrics!!  The sun doesn't 'sometimes' go up and down, it ALWAYS goes up and down - ALWAYS - you morons.  "I'm wondering which one you are watching now."  Which one?

The crapilicious album of all time.+N+For my version of this album, O.G. means old guy. For my opinion, he is not a very good rapper. He should retire pernamently+music
By far the best Camera Obscura album yet+P+This is simply one of the loveliest albums you will ever hope to hear.  Tracyanne Campbell and her band mates in Camera Obscura have labored under the shadow of their fellow Glasgow musicians Belle and Sebastian.  It doesn't help that like Belle and Sebastian their songs are more softly edged and lyrical than most other rock bands.  But although there is a superficial resemblance between the two bands, especially when Imogen Campbell takes the vocals instead of Murdoch, there are also significant differences.  Campbell is a far more delicate songwriter than Stuart Murdoch and her compositions are far more delicate.  She lacks his brilliant quirkiness and astonishing gift for melody, though her songs frequently feature very fine melodies.  But Murdoch is probably the finest melodist in music today, so the comparison is unfair to her.  On the other hand, most of Campbell's lyrics express emotions that I can relate to far more easily than Murdoch's.  He may be the greater artist, but she lives pretty much where I do.  Camera Obscura turned out two very good albums before this one, but this is easily their best effort yet.  All of the songs are consistently excellent and Campbell's lovely voice graces everyone.  She is a remarkably subtle singer, very gifted in her phrasing and expression.  But as fine as she is as a singer, she is better as a songwriter.  I like a lot of the cuts on this disc, in particular "I Need All the Friends I Can Get" and the truly sad "Dory Previn," about the young Mia Farrow breaking up her and Andre Previn's marriage.  But my favorite cut by far is the extraordinary "Lloyd, I'm Ready to Be Heartbroken," named for one of Lloyd Cole's best songs on his classic album RATTLESNAKES, "Are You Ready to Be Heartbroken?"  All in all, this is one of my favorite albums of the year so far.  I think it will appeal strongly to anyone who loves Belle and Sebastian, but also to people who are drawn to Mazzy Star.  The album possesses much of the same wistfulness and longing found on their albums.  Basically, if you love wonderfully subtle and magnificently fragile music, this is going to win your heart+music
ONE SINGULAR SENSATION? YES, BUT ONLY THE ORIGINAL CAST ALBUM+N+It was, and remains, one singular sensation. A Chorus Line changed the face of American musical theater, with an urbane book by Nick Dante and James Kirkwood and sophisticated yet obvious lyrics and music by Ed Kleban and Marvin Hamlisch. The Pulitzer prize-winning musical has been resurrected in Broadway and on CD . . . And we can't wonder why. Those familiar with the original cast recording will cringe at the flatness of the "new" recording, a recording that's simultaneously intrusive on the memory and superfluous in any collection. Is this what Baayork Lee did for love+music
What terrible music....+N+when the man sings, he sounds like he is blowing through an off key microphone.  The songs and lyrics are all so terribly written and sung, If you can call that singing at all+music
Lovin' It+P+This is a great collection of hits.  It's great to be able to buy these cds where you like every song on the cd and not just one -- that's why I but the collections of hits, but then you can't go wrong with Alan Jackson+music
I LOVE MAYSA!!![.]+N+let's just get this out of the way now. maysa? i'm on your team babes, but this cd just hasn't done it for me. i got your 1st cd & was hooked. i waited for the next & was floored! not in a good way! the cd jacket was so drab & tired, just like damn near every song inside the case. i let it sit on my shelf & decided to give it a listen again. still i didn't feel it. it's in my car right now & i still can't get through it all. i'm still on your team though. i have your latest & i play it 2 death. over & over. cd's 1 & 3 are both must haves. but this 1 stinks+music
Kate wears her red shoes and has some fun+P+I think this album is stunning and fantastic! i have recently been getting into Kates music...first i got Hounds of love and was immediatly sucked in i loved it and still do,what an album! Then i got The kick inside which i also immediatly liked but it lacked a little something not sure what that somehting is? i then got never for ever, wow so diffrent and hypnotic and growed on me so much every time i listened, and then this. Abit upset and put off but some other reviews i had set my mind to get this so thats what i did, definately NOT dissapointed! so what if its more in the times and a bit over produced and maybe lacking some of the crazness??? its such a good good album! still has amazing melodies, craaaaazy lyrics and its fun (even though some of the subject matter isnt, kate was struggling at the time) rubberband girl,moments of pleasure,song of solomen,lilly,top of the world and why should i love you are highlights for me but my fave song is the amazing and unbelieveably touching "and so is love" as soona s that song had finished for the first time for me i was like"WOW".....seriously give ALL of Kate a chance, im getting "the dreaming" this weekend and I KNOW im in for an amzing challenge, but i also know i will love that too! The red shoes doesnt deserve bad reviews just because its not people BEST kate album+music
Basura+N+Ni se molesten en comprar esta basura, no sirve, nada que ver, El problema es el siguiente aunque ya sabemos que el quiere cantar pop en vez de salsa no es la primera vez que lo hace y a tenido mucho exito con los otros cds anteriores pero este desde que comienza la lirica de las canciones como que no riman, el ritmo tampoco ayuda, el disco anterior si que era un disco tenia salsa y pop como este. El anterior le da 20 patas a este,al parecer el cambio los arreglistas si me gusta como una o dos canciones es mucho ( boricua siempre sere y sobre tu piel) tanta espera para nada..........+music
Its Wack+N+Seriously you dont need me to tell you wack this album is, if you've ever heard it you'll know yourself the depths that this album plummets to.  I'll be honest, I heard Thug Lovin on the radio and thought it was O.K, all the other singles though, Mesmerize etc.. were s**t.  A friend of mine offered to burn me a copy, free of charge, and i thought fine, what's the worst that could happen, I was mistaken, I would compare listening to this with torture.  If your into sing along pop songs, with a little bad language for good measure, you may like this album.  To put this in the hip-hop genre is misleading, Ja actually attempts to 'sing' half the songs on here, and when he's not singing he does his best Tupac impression.  Thankfully at the time of writing this, his career appears to be over, if we can rid the hip-hop world of Nelly and 50 Cent as well, the world would be much better  for it.  Avoid any albums by this phoney.  Message to the honorable, agreed most of the rappers listed are s**t, but Ja destroying Snoop, Eazy-E, Mack 10 and DMX, don't talk s**t, this diva couldn't touch any of them.  After writing this I noticed someone was selling this album on Amazon for 1 cent, that should tell you all you need to know about it+music
takes a while to appreciate+P+first of all, I should state that I am the number one Steely Dan fan in the world and yeah I know, this is a Fagen work. when I first listened to this CD I was unimpressed.  same old same old.  But listen again (and again) and it will grow on you.  it will remind you of the days when you said to yourself "this band is *$%#@ good - i'm glad so-and-so (kathy) turned me on to them".  favorite track is "mary shut the garden door" - not because of the lyrics but because of the jazz.  +music
Thunderstorms+N+Very dissapointing. Too many wildlife creature noises. If I had wanted to hear birds singing in the rain and other animal noises I would have looked for a title that matched my request. I wanted to hear rain and thunder only.+music
Boring+N+This Cd I feel is too long. I can't stand Foreigner anymore, they used to be great. Awful edits like Urgent, Jukebox Hero, & Waiting for a Girl Like You have to be changed. And that boring ballad, what is it?????? I Want to Know What Love Is....Irritating for 2 minutes. And that singer, he kind of raises his voice too much. Not one of the best bands I have ever heard. Other irritating songs are HEADKNOCKER, Blue Morning, & Head games and they kinda suck. They just give me on my nerves. This is noise.....buy any album from Dire Straits insted. Dire Straits are the best.....................................+music
Magical, if not uneven, Journey+P+'Magical Mystery Tour' is the most uneven of all the Beatles' albums.  The familiar songs are magnificent, but while some of the originals are poor, they are always interesting.  The American record company did a cut-and-paste on all of the Beatles' albums up to 'Sgt. Pepper', and, while it was to their great detriment, their intervention here was a masterstroke.  Because EP's (extended plays, records with five to seven songs, like a half-album) are part and parcel of the UK and not the U.S., this c.d. contains a jackpot of the Beatles' accomplished singles of '67.  Without them there wouldn't be a full album as we know it. Significantly, it was the only time the British record company later complied to the US format.  To start, the title track is a fun, carnival anthem.  It is looser and less serious than 'Sgt. Pepper'.  Then, Paul, subjectively matches himself with the perceptive and beautiful "Fool on the Hill," with its admonitions from yet another memorable character, meant to look at the conventional world differently at the expense of alienation.  However, it is John's "I am the Walrus" that pours out surreal imagery (yet borrows a few references from Lewis Carroll) that is the album's highlight.  From there the original songs are interesting, but substandard.  "Flying" makes an interesting instrumental with vocals added without any discernible words, but it seems more like an exercise than a good song.  Much in this vein, "Your Mother Should Know," is a shadow of Paul's best vaudevillian efforts, including "When I'm Sixty Four" and "Honey Pie".  The echoing vocal effects don't do anything to contribute to the song, either.  Also, George contributes what may be his poorest Beatles' song, "Blue Jay Way".  While it is understandable that spiritual awakening is the heart of all major religions, this song is done with unremarkable lyrics and sung with effects that make it sound like he's a deep sea diver accompanied by drowzy cello patterns.  The remarkable second half almost needs no elaboration.  "Hello/Goodbye" heralds the second half with one of their catchiest songs.  "Penny Lane" and "Strawberry Fields Forever" made what many believe to be one of the best singles ever.  The former is glorious and the latter is Lennon at his philosophical best.  "All You Need Is Love" may seem somewhat dated, but it needs a revival (and not just in credit card commercials!)  It is still a remarkable and entertaining anthem and subjectively one of the Beatles' very best songs.  "Baby You're a Rich Man," the song's B-side is no throw-away, either.  Clever and funny, like Lennon, it is a catchy and mesmerizing piece.  Song for song, 'Magical Mystery Tour' is still essential.  It represents their most uneven effort, but retains some of their best music. Either way it always remains interesting.      +music
Don't miss this one, it rocks+P+Game on, this is good stuff!  To be honest, I wanted to like Ray's first solo Stag a lot more than I did, which is why I walked, not ran to Prom,   But then that was before I caught the Indigo Girls last summer, where Ray and her mandolin wowed the crowd with the anthem Let It Ring.  It was the first time I'd heard it and it made the hair on the back of my neck stand up.    The theme throughout is pretty obvious, it's called Prom, after all.  But it's also pretty obvious that you didn't have to grow up queer in small town rural America to feel like a freak. The sentiments of adolescent angst and isolation are universal, after all.  But beyond waxing poetic about adolescence, there are some great cuts offering stories of love's trainwrecks and dissatisfaction with the music industry, as well.  This album is less gritty than Stag and the sound is a lot more refreshing and graceful than you might expect.  This outing is to Ray as All That We Let In is to Indigo Girls.  The album showcases the elements we've come to expect from Ray and the Indigo Girls: unflinchingly honest lyrics coupled with uncompromising musicianship.  Those are rare commodities in today's music industry.  Unleash your inner awkward teenage/freak/geek self and enjoy the Prom.+music
They didn't.+N+My sister got this CD, and at first I didn't care. Until I heard the Beatles covers. I was absolutely horrified at what they did to those classic songs. The people who make these are the spawn of idiocy.  If those kids ruin another great song I'll hunt them down and throttle them in their sleep+music
overrated+N+don't get me wrong, there's some great stuff here: Behind Blue Eyes, Substitute, Bargain, Won't gGet Fooled Again, Baba O'Reilly, a few others.  But if the Who are going to be in the co. of the all time greats, there shouldn't be any filler on a 2 disk set anthology.  They're the most overrated band in rock history. tried to be rockin' and rollin' rock and roll while at the same time putting a lot of effort into concept albums, didn't get the mix right.  Pink Floyd mastered the concept album 'per se', David Bowie gave us the concept album that really wasn't (rise & fall of zig strdst & spdrs frm mrs), while tommy, 4ophenia, and the one that was aborted (I forget the working title)fall short, somewhere in between. Just as the Who fall short, somewhere in between the Beatles, Stones and Led Zep. Daltrey as a great frontman? gimme a break; not worthy of shining the shoes of Jagger or Plant, not even Ozzy (in his prime with Sabbath) or Ian Gillan (Deep Purple). He doesn't even sing on some of their most famous songs, and he didn't write any of them (to go by the liner notes that came with this disc, anyway).  Many of their songs are described as quirky. 'silly' is closer to the mark. How 'bout just 'dumb'?  The Stones declared that 'time was on their side' and marched defiantly in the face of all obstacles, including time itself . The Who promised that they would die before they got old, on the other hand, and failed to deliver. This was my last attempt to 'get into' a band that I USED TO feel guilty for never having 'gotten into+music
I hear their next release will include a fold out shopping bag.+N+I, like many others, wanted to like this CD, but was really disappointed. A lot of work obviously went into the creation of this. They have an interesting sound at first that quickly gets predictable.  I thought the first song was decent enough, but after that the CD spirals downward fast. The main problem, as many reviewers have noted, is the singers voice, which is often hard to hear. But if I had a voice like his, I'd probably want it towards the back of the sound mix.   The most original thing about this CD was the liner notes/lyrics, which are presented in the form of a funeral program. Get it? Cool, huh?+music
A Classic Death Cab Album+P+Death Cab For Cutie's follow up to their 1999 debut Something About Airplanes continues to build on their ethereal, atmospheric, unique, indie pop-rock sound.  We Have The Facts is a more experimental, dynamic, rock album that still retains the previous album's sentimentality.  This is the album that transformed them into experimental indie rockers, but didn't launch them into the mainstream.  This is a pure work of art, technically the band uses the chords in a very abstract and sparse way, the percussion is slow, and contemplating.  Some songs break out of that pattern and demonstrate a more full bodied, but not yet developed sound.  Most of the album relies on the musical  production.  Ben Gibbard's voice is as haunting and beautiful as it ever was.  He is given the perfect backdrop which complement his voice well.  These songs work so well because of their minimalism.  This album has a great sophistication to it, there is nothing else like it.  The structures of the songs aren't traditional, so they seem refreshingly new and never get tiresome.  Each song is sequenced so that it works well against the last song, and the songwriting captures the emotional depth of the music perfectly.  Lyrically, the songs focus on loss and relationships.  Company Calls Epilogue is about a wedding gone sour, while 405 is about relationship.  The wavy guitar melodies are catchy and loosen up the sometimes slow pace of the songs.  This is an album that gradually builds on you after a couple listens.  It's not over the top, and requires multiple listens to capture the depth of the music.  As a whole, the album works incredibly well, it's cohesive and consistent.  These songs have been crafted carefully and are painfully addictive once you begin to appreciate their sophistication.  This is indie rock at it's finest.  The production takes this album up to new great heights.  This album is similar to The Forbidden Love EP, which is also good.  In my opinion, We Have The Facts, and The Photo Album demonstrate Death Cab's early raw style, where everything was understated simply and beautifully, before the overproduced Transatlanticism and Plans.  This is a great album to listen to if you want to relax, or just think.  As they continue to develop as artists, it's amazing to watch their sound change, for better or for worse.  Recommended.    +music
The girl cant sing .Case closed.+N+Cassie is a beautiful young girl who used to model and been discovered by Mottola and been taken under Diddy wings.This cd has good beats and thats all i can say cuz thats all Im hearing .Her voice is very weak and low ,sounds as she s whispering and she absolutely cannot perform live.This is Not Quality Music.I would not reccomend this cd+music
Cowboy Bebop, Music for everyone+P+This album is mostly lyrical songs, but not in a bad way. This is a good album for fans of the lyrical songs of the series. The styles on this OST range from blues-rock to cowboy western to metal to sugary-sweet pop to medieval music. The range between all the vocalists is very vast and very welcome.  "American Money": Is the bounty hunter t.v. show's theme, very western with it's banjo and gunshots. "Don't Bother None": An awesome blues-rock song sung by the gruff Mai Yamane. Here voice is rough and raw and perfectly fit for this kind of song. "Live in Baghdad": The random metal song in the mix, with surf guitar. I love this song exactly for it's randomness in the series. "Cats on Mars": A super-cute song! This is the absolute cutest song of the series. It's poppy, it's cute, it's fun. Hard to resist. "Green Bird": A sweet vocal by Gabriela Robin, her voice is so gentle and nice. "Elm": A song that sounds like a medieval ballad from a skilled guitarist. It's so beautiful and addictive, the vocals are perfectly harmonized and the skill of the guitarist is very impressive+music
Z - My Morning Jacket+P+The quintet, which forms My Morning Jacket, hail from Louisville Ky. The lead singer and band's leader/founder has the unlikely name Jim James. I have to assume that since Jim is the shortened version for James, making his formal name James James, that his mother was drunk when she named him. J.J. founded the band in the late nineties with his cousin, guitarist John John. Gotcha! Just kidding. Cuzz's name was John Quaid. Cuzz along with keyboardist Danny Cash, found the touring too much of a grind and left the band after the release of their third album. In addition to J.J. their current lineup consists of: Two-tone Tommy on Bass, Patrick Hallahan on Drums. Late joiners Bo Koster (keyboards) and Carl Broemel (guitar) replaced Quaid and Cash.  Z  My first impression of `Z' was that it was quite a bit different than my typical choice for aural enjoyment. My second impression was that it was not something for which I would lay down fifteen bucks. My last and continuing impression was that there was, indeed some worthwhile enjoyable music emanating from my CD player.  Trying to categorize the band's music is challenging. I word have to say the overall the band play's an indie sounding pop-rock with forays into progressive, folk and alternative, even psychedelia. Their music tends to be happy and poppy with a lot of variation between songs. The album starts off with a song named "Wordless," which actually reminds me of the song "Angel" from the Romeo and Juliet soundtrack but with a mild cha cha style beat. It's probably because of J.J.'s strong singing on the song but for me the similarities are strong. "It Beats 4 U" White Stripes beginning doesn't impress me, but picks up in the middle with J.J.'s reverberated vocals, a cello, some whistling, finishing somewhat psychedelic. Track three, "Gideon," has some interesting moments with J.J. sounding like he's singing through a tunnel yet his vocal remain strong. The song has some noticeably good keyboards and the tempo builds ending in a crescendo.  "What a Wonderful Man," is a short mulligan stew style song featuring tavern kind of vocals and a tinny guitar." Track five is "Off the Record." I didn't particularly like the beginning but about a third of the way through it becomes a fabulous bluesy, psychedelic instrumental. "In the Woods" starts out with a circus Hammond which recurs throughout augmenting an um pah pah circus beat. The seventh song is "Anytime," probably the rockingest if not the catchiest song on the album.  The next song at just over six minutes is the penultimate longest song. Other than some really good piano parts, that seems to be the most memorable part of "Lay Low." The ninth track, "Knot come loose," is a forgettable ballad but the last song "Dondante is an eight minute masterpiece, by far the best and most refreshing song on the album." Beginning inauspiciously with J.J. singing to a slow casual beat and subtle guitar, the song heats up after a slow start, immediately after a nice guitar solo into an explosion of sound, featuring J.J.'s soaring vocals and a whining guitar, ala post rock style, before gradually fading out to obscurity.  Conclusion  I don't think I'd plunk down fifteen bucks for "Z" because even though it's a pretty good album, I would seldom if ever be in the mood for this confluence of eclectically influenced music, especially since I tend to gravitate to the heavier variety of music. However, I cannot help but feel that it would appeal to a large segment of the music buying public. Are you one of them?  Final rating 4 stars.+music
Another drop in the bucket+N+I saw this on a "best of 2005" list and I have to say I am disappointed. The musicality of this record is not too bad. It's not terribly creative, but it is enjoyable. What really turned me off was the incredibly vapid and thoughtless lyrics. Unfortunately this is just another pop record, of which there are way too many these days. The only track on here that I would give a second listen too is seagull. I wouldn't recommend the rest of the album+music
Joss Stone+N+I traded my girlfriend my Nickelback CD for Joss Stone. Now I kinda wished I had kept my Nickelback CD. She hates the Nickelback CD and I hate the Joss Stone CD, but she also hates the Joss Stone CD. If I kinda liked the Nickelback CD better I would of kept it because I kinda knew I wasn't going to be into the Joss Stone CD. But I just kind of figured the Joss Stone CD would be a little bit better than the Nickelback CD and my girlfriend was completely thinking that the Nickelback CD was gonna be a LOT better than the Joss Stone CD, but man was she let down completely. And for as much as I really don't want the Nickelback CD back at this point I just assume let her keep it and I'll get by with the Joss Stone CD. I mean I guess what I am trying to say is that I sorta liked the Nickleback CD in the beginning, but once my girlfriend said she hated it I figured I got the better end of the bargain by trading her for the Joss Stone CD which at first seemed like a much better CD to have than Nickelback. I think my girlfriend wants to trade back again and if we do then I guess I just have to live with the Nickelback CD, but I'll prolly never play it again if she gives it back to me. BLEH!!  Matthew+music
This IS baby making music.+P+Well, I am amazed that at 64 or 65 years old Ron Isley is still making incredible music.  However, some of the lyrics are explicit.  This CD would be great for a honeymoon.  The CD should have a sticker on it entitled, "SERIOUSLY, FOR ADULTS WHO WANT TO CONCEIVE CHILDREN!"  But I guess that's why the CD is entitled, "Baby Making Music.+music
Sad very sad+N+My wife bought this for me.  I was really looking forward to listening, but I found it a painful experience.  I not sure if it is the song choices, the production values, the arrangements or a combination, but the album overall is just a huge disappointment.  No songs from it have made it on to my Ipod+music
Just another generic Grindcore band trying to make it somewhere...+N+To be quite honest, I don't understand how anyone could consider this trash to be music. It is just a bunch of noise. I could do what these guys do with a bunch of 13-14 year old amatuer drum, guitar, and bass players in my garage. There is little to no rhythm to their music, and the vocals, quite frankly, are horrible. I can't even tell one song apart from another.  Grindcore just makes Metal look bad. The only Grindcore bands I actually do enjoy are Pig Destroyer and Agoraphobic Nosebleed. Go listen to some of their stuff if you want good Grindcore. Ed Gein is just talentless garbage. Don't bother with The Tony Danza Tap Dance Extravaganza either+music
Always on+P+I listen to this CD at least twice a week.  Definitely worth every penny and then some.  My faves are: I wanna be your lover, Do me, baby, delirious, I would die 4 U, If I was your girlfriend, Kiss, Sexy M.F., Gett Off, Cream, and of course, purple rain.  Highly recommended+music
give it a listen+P+ok its true TTR dosent have the best singer but he can write good songs.If u find the lyrics they are very touching.These guys are now working on a full lenght and eating up the local/indie scene. The best tracks are Talk Radio and Plans To Wake Up On The Beach. Strong buy if you like punk/emo+music
The higher you go! +P+Energy=Hot Hot Heat! this album is full of it, though not just in the album as well as on the stage these four performers pour their hearts out to you and sweat as the play their instruments. With catchy melodies thougout the album, though fast that you have to look at the lyrics to see what exactly he says, you'll be sure to enjoy this alternative' dance album that makes any kid that thinks he/she is to cool to dance, Dance!!, that is all Hot Hot Heat makes you want to dance, besides that, they also have other songs like "elevator" and "jingle jangle" to tone down the album. This whole album comes from all of the emotions of a gone band member, but newly found one, being a great addition, and being in love. So to dance and sing get this album.+music
sucks madly+N+i dont know why people like broken social scene, they are boring boring boring. i listned to this entire album and it was difficult. i wanted to turn it off really bad, but i had to go through it all to prove to myself that it is not good for anyone. for real though people, there is tons of music outthere that is not boring. you should check it out+music
Merritt creates an alternate universe, where, the real world doesn't matter.+P+When it comes to "pop," people are use to hearing the crap played on the popular radio stations. Brittany Spears, and terribly horrid music like that. I want people to know the true meaning of "pop" music. Here it is in the dictionary:  "a bland watered-down version of rock'n'roll with more rhythm and harmony and an emphasis on romantic love"  Now, before anyone bashes me, I don't agree with the "bland" and "watered-down" words, expecially in the case of Stephin Merrit, but it's true of the music played today. There's magic in this album. It's so full of life, and dare I say, the bliss of happiness. It's truly amazing how "Wasps' Nests" can completely change my perceptions. It puts me in a state of mind. Maybe I'm just a hopeless romantic, but this album happens to be the soundtrack to my life, as cheesy as that sounds. And no matter how cheesy the lyrics may be, You'll find yourself in love with them, almost as much as the luscious sound that is, "The 6ths." A masterpiece+music
Greatest album ever made.+P+Keane is one of the greatest bands of all time. The fact that they use piano/keyboards/bass/drums on every song, with no guitars at all, shows that they are more musically sophisticated than all the other mindless guitar rock that's out there. There are more than enough guitar-based bands. "Somewhere Only We Know" is the best song of all time. Beautiful lyrics, solid piano backbone, and a steady, moderate tempo, make it a brilliant album-opener. The album has upbeat pop/rock, like "Bend and Break" and "This is the Last Time," slow, sorrowful ballads, like "She Has No Time" and "We Might as Well be Strangers," gentle, peaceful melodies, like "Sunshine," and slightly ethereal, unearthly ones like "Untitled 1" and "Bedshaped." Plus, all the lyrics are intensely personal and honest, ones that everyone can relate to, in one way or another. All together, the album is a classic, one that (if the American public knows anything about music) will live on to be known as one of the greatest albums ever made. Every song is a masterpiece. There are no fillers.+music
One good song.+N+I absolutely loved that song "Carry On Wayward Son" which sounds like one of the greatest stuff in history. Rest of the other songs on this album are not that good. 2-stars+music
Disappointing mixing+N+Contrary to the previous review, I find that commenting on the quality of the mixing on this cd to be essential.  It has to be the sloppiest 'exhibition' of professional mixing that I've heard consigned to disc.  It just sounded like there was too much emphasis on getting as many tracks on in 70 mins, regardless of flow, or beat matching.  Very let down by this disc+music
Consumer warning - critical flaw in mastering+N+The charming 1977 musical is not the subject of this note.  The show is great and the liner notes are superb. However, consumers should note that there is a critical flaw in the mastering (at least on the disc version that I obtained). It is very unfortunate that the manufacturers did not pull this mis-mastered version from the market. As noted elsewhere (and absolutely correct), an entire track of sound is lost and can only be heard distantly in the background.   If the problem is corrected and later discs are OK, it just compounds the problem with no way to know if you have a flawed disc or an OK disc. A most unfortunate problem for what should be a joyous recording+music
Just good fun music+P+This is a great album.  It is perfect for doing chores at home, driving in the car or plugging away in the cubicle.  I took a chance on this ablum because I enjoyed "pins" and "maps" from fever to tell and I am glad I did.  "Golden Lion", "Way Out" and "Cheated Hearts" are my favorites. +music
A cd that now lives in my car stereo+P+How to decribe this gem of a CD. There is such a gentle warm feeling to the songs. It appears that Steve Kilbey's voice is aging like a fine wine.  Great selection of songs with a sprinkling of five new ones.  I have always tried to get friends and coworkers to like the Church and this one is getting the warmest response. Any fan of the Church will enjoy and it is a great place to start for the curious+music
Houston we have a problem!!!!!!!!!+P+Houston is doing it big.  Slim thug,Pall Wall, Chamillionare and Mike Jones.  All There albums are great.  But Slim thugs sticks out due to the neptunes.Like A Boss wouldn't have the same attitude if the neptunes hadnt made the beat. 1.Like A Boss 2.Click Clack 3.3 Kings 4.Already Platinum 5.I aint heard of that+music
Eh+N+Bland, bland, and more bland.  It seemed to be trying for some kind of emotional resonance, and fell far short of the mark.  With the except on the main character's mother, nearly every single character was completely unlikeable.  And a little Lea Delaria goes a long, long way.  It does replicate the 80s very well, but it just feels so devoid of humanity+music
Great Message... Poor Delivery+N+Don't get me wrong. I'm a raging hippie, who's completely anti-war. And the lyrics on this album are great, and I love the cover of "Imagine" by John Lennon. But it seems that the actual desire to make good *music* fell to the back burner on this one. It's not that the songs are bad per se, but they're all fillers. It's an entire album of fillers, with no really great songs to bring them up. Overall, a disappointment, which is unfortunate, since the wonderful message is lost by the lack of lustre in the music.   If you're new to A Perfect Circle, pick one of the other albums. If you're a veteran, sure, pick it up. But I'd suggest listening to it on random with your other A Perfect Circle and Tool cd's+music
Your Disco Needs Kylie+P+When Kylie released the single "Spinning Around"...that's what it...Kylie was popular again...the difficult songs were history. It was time for new sex & dance Kylie. The single went number 1 in UK and it was a real success all over the world. The second single "On a Night Like This" went number 2 in UK and also "Kids" (a classic song made with Robbie Williams) went number 2. The album wen through the roof annd it was Kylie's time for her greatest success ever. Even the beginning of her carriere where she sang "I Should Be So Lucky" and "The Loco-Motion" can't be compared this time. There was released one more single in UK "Please Stay" which also went to top ten. "Your Disco Needs You" is so fresh and powerful that it is one my favourites from this album...the chorus is excellent...it's wonderful when Kylie uses a choir. "Bittersweet Goodbye" is a peaceful and sad song...Kylie's voice is very sad. Other songs are more like party songs and that's why this is recommended for everybody who wants to dance...or likes good music. By the way, what does "I'm Under the Influence of Love" means? I have an idea for that.  Stars: Spinning Around, On a Night Like This, Your Disco Needs You, Please Stay, Kid+music
BUYIN' THEM OUTTA ORDER!!!+P+I've just gotten hip to the Hotel Costes series by Stephane Pompougnac (so I'm 4 years behind with this review--please, bare with me!)...I'm one of those people who don't want to be left outta the loop when it comes to stuff--at any rate, I started buying this series outta order...I bought #5 first, #4 was too latin for me to purchase, #1 too expensive, and #3 was unavailable...soo, I decided on &quot;La Suite&quot; because of the unfamiliarity of the songs and artists on it. Well, some of them anyway. The ubiquitous &quot;Jazz Music&quot; by De-Phazz almost made me not buy this set, but I said, what the hell? It won't be the first time I bought a mix/comp CD with songs I've already seen or heard a million times already. How does that work anyway? What? Certain record labels/ mixers all bid on the same songs or something? ahem...As usual,I digress.  All that notwithstanding, &quot;La Suite&quot; was an entertaining delight and voyage into chill-house, as I so aptly pen music such as that remixed by Pompougnac. This whole series is tempting me to go ahead and buy 1, 3 and 4 no matter the cost.  Hey--I'm the type of music buyer who likes to own all volumes in a series, what can I say? Anyway, getting back to the review of &quot;La Suite&quot;, it's not as good as #5 (or from what I could sample on #1 in Borders), but it does have some stellar moments with the opening &quot;To Ulrike M.&quot; by Doris Days with a Zero 7 remix?? OK, Pompougnac, what gives? I thought these were supposed to be songs mixed by you?  Other stand out tracks are from 45 Dip (Check these guys out on the &quot;Acid Lounge in Space&quot; Comp CD), Sympatique (Now, this is true Parisian music despite it's &quot;cheesiness&quot; as one reviewer stated), Mo'Horizons (nice, as always), Palais Mascotte (strong dance floor appeal), I:Cube (hypnotic with a 60s feel), Pascal w/Mister Day (nice disco-track), Mr. Scruff (the song says it all), Boozoo Bajou (nocturanal) and Streetlife (cinematic and groovy, baby). This is a worthy investment for any Chill/House music fan.  The songs on Costes &quot;La Suite&quot; are refreshing and upbeat from beginning to end. Sure to impress even your most stiff-necked guests at your next get-together--you know the ones, they stand on the wall all night long with their half empty bottles of Corona trying desperately to look cool+music
Goregous Operetta+P+If you're a fan of regular book musicals, this one is not for you!!! Passion is an operetta style love triangle that is complex, poignant, and beautiful. Stephen Sondheim's brillaint score ties the entrie musical together, which again helps him keep his genius status. The clever weaving of songs, scenes, and, most interestingly, letters, make for a great cast album.  As for performances, it's the females who own this show. Marin Mazzie is as glorious as ever as Clara (she's even better in Ragtime), and Tony-winner Donna Murphy brings all of the emotion forward in her portrayal of Fosca.  For those who are used to the usual Sondheim, this one may dissapoint. Others, however, will love this opera of love+music
John has very poor taste+N+Generally harmless, except for one very offensive song about siblings that hate each other and hate their parents.  The song is probably funny to ultra-sophisticated, cynical adults.  But the song is totally inappropriate for a four year old.  I wouldn't bring this CD into your house+music
Beautiful Mendelssohn!+P+Chamber Music seems so right during the boisterous mechanics of the holidays and one sure respite from the garish noise of the external season can be found in works like the Mendelssohn Piano Trios.  Here Eugene Istomin, Leonard Rose, Isaac Stern perform Piano Trios 1 and 2 in a manner that bespeaks camaraderie of the performers as well as a complete respect for these luminous works.  Some have called these works piano sonatas with obbligato and while for this listener that is an unfair judgment, Eugene Istomin plays the piano part with enough flair and thoughtful propulsion that he does at times sound the more important.  But that is Mendelssohn's writing and not a self-aggrandizement of a pianist.  The overall sound is simply superb. These two trios are some of the loveliest ever written from that era and the gentlemen performing them offer sophisticated and informed interpretations. The recording is excellent, the music is rarefied!  Highly recommended. Grady Harp, December 05+music
Nelly and Chingy represent all that is wrong with rap+N+First of all what kind of name is Nelly? It sounds about as bad-ass as the Bee Gee's. And although Nelly isn't as bad as Chingy or Feminem, he isn't much of an improvement either. The lyrics are stupid, and often ridiculous (uh, 'Hot in Herre' anyone?), and he would go as far as rapping about sneakers, in that horrible excuse of a rap 'Air Force Ones'. 'Pimp Juice' has to be the worst song I've ever heard, well, next to 'The Real Slim Shady' by Butterfinger, er, Eminem. Nelly looks like a freakin' gorrila! And that stupid bandaide doesn't help him too much either. If I had to pick the five worst rappers in history they would be as follows: 5. Ludacris 4. Fat Joe 3. Nelly 2. Chingy 1. Eminem Nelly at 3...it doesn't take a genius to figure out that buying this is a bad decision. Jesus! Nelly makes 50 Cent look like Eazy E+music
Ronald & Ernie you don't need R. Kelly! Get rid of him!+N+I've been a huge fan of the Isleys for over 30 years, and stuck by them through the early Motown soul and their golden groove-funk period of the 1970s, through to the later stuff right up to the excellent Mission To Please album. But that's when they should have dumped R. Kelly, because it's the last album that had any really decent hook to it. And when you have a blistering guitarist like Ernie Isley, why bury him so far in the mix that his licks sound like they're being played through cotton wool?    R. Kelly's plodding grooves just grind from one indistinguishable track to another, which is pretty much the case on the even more disappointing follow-up to this, Body Kiss. The only track that kicks any ass here is the opener, Move Your Body, which fools you into thinking this might be a return to former glories for our heroes. Sadly, the leaden funk of R. Kelly then comes crashing in like a tidal wave of sludge and we get a whole turgid mess of leaden walking-pace 'grooves' that might sound all right in the background when you're getting it on with the partner of your dreams, but as listening music just gets you all exasperated and reaching for the 3+3 album again.    Come on, Isleys, dump the Kelly glop and get back to what you can do best+music
Very Disappointed ...Thoughts from a Cohen "First Timer"+N+I had never heard Leonard Cohen's music but saw references to it frequently when looking at other singers/songwriters.  Given his status/reputation I thought I should get this CD and learn what all the fuss was about.  Having had no preconceptions, I have to say I was quite disappointed.  I think the music has not aged well and is pretty unremarkable.  Perhaps the style liberated others to pursue new directions but the work in and of itself is ho hum at best.  Specific example that speaks volumes:  listen to Cohen's singing of his "Hallelujah" and then listen to Jeff Buckley's cover of that song on "Grace" which was recorded in 1994.  Sorry, Leonard, you cannot hold even a birthday-sized candle to Jeff Buckley's rendition of your own song.  It is a very unflattering comparison that pretty much put the first and last nail in the coffin for my appreciation of Cohen's legacy.  "Tant pis, vers le bonheur.+music
Disappointed+N+My first exposure to Leonard Cohen was hearing Allison Crowe singing "Hallelujah." I was awestruck so I decided to get the Essential Leonard Cohen. Bad decision! The man barely breaks out of a monotone and sounds like he's terrified that someone will hear him above the accompaniment.  He's another artist who should continue writing but let others perform his works+music
If you love Rock n' Roll music - buy this!+P+There's no point in repeating what others here have said.  Had it not been for a chance perusal of the review in Rolling Stone, I never would have known about this CD.  It is a great, joyful rock album - I never even listened to the Dolls in years gone by - but this one nails the spirit of the genre.  I've worked backstage at Stones, AC/DC and Dead shows, and I modestly suggest that I know the real thing when I hear it.  Tear the shrink wrap off, baby, and crank this one up on the way home with the windows down, while the weather is still warm enough to do so!  If you're a guitarist, pay attention to what Syl is playing, and watch the video - he's really learned to do it right+music
Easily the best Beastie Boys album...+P+Hey, what's up? This is my first review. At first I didn't feel it was necessary; Paul's Boutique already has five stars, and deserves every one of them. Still, the quality of this record compelled me to express my thoughts on it, too.  This album is near perfect. The only track I feel is weak (and it's not even that bad) is Egg Man. I didn't dig it at first... but it grew on me, so I'll give it a listen, now, especially for the sampling (as mentioned by another reviewer).  Every single track on the album is linked. I think this adds alot to it, because it's like a non-stop track. Very enjoyable. If you're looking for a great hip-hop album or want to get into the Beastie Boys, definitely cop this album. Solid Gold Hits isn't great, and the anthology isn't worth it. All Beastie Boys albums pale in comparison to this sucker. Get Paul's Boutique+music
very disappointing+N+I bought this CD because it got a lot of good reviews, and the description sounded like something I would enjoy. However, it turned out to be an atrocious CD. It is very repetitive and monotonous throughout. The songs pretty much all sound the same. There's little melodic variation, and the vocals have basically no range. The lyrics are extremely uninspired. I'm glad I bought this used at a cheap price. I don't know if I'm going to give it away or just throw it away; it's that bad.+music
Too mannered+N+And what's the deal with the CD cover? Anyway..I have always found her voice to be too breathy,too mannered,and trying too hard to be sexy.I just do not like her singing.I tried.I couldn't get into it.Give me Ella or June or Sarah.Now that's singing.Sorry Krall fans+music
This is great!+P+I was introduced to Sissel through a recent trip to Norway.  She has a voice of an Angel!  Through buying this CD, which I listen to in the car on the way to and from work, for a relaxing mood, I have been introduced to her other CD's.  Wish they were more available in the USA.  I really enjoy this album+music
Is he wearing lipstick?!?!?!?+N+I saw on the internet a picture of chingy rapping on stage and a notorious porn transvestite with HIS hand on chingy's crotch. Now I knew chingy couldn't rap his way out of a wet paper bag but I never questioned his manhood. Now that I saw the picture and read the article about Chingy and his transvestite lover I am so done with him. I hope the reviews he gets encourages him to find another occupation. This album is classic garbage and would be a perfect coaster for the next party you have at your house+music
He's a New Favorite of Mine!+P+I bought this CD because I loved the song NOTHING CATCHES JESUS BY SURPRISE!  Then I found that this CD is packed full of HITS.  It is nice to hear so many of his songs played on the radio, not just one or two from this CD.  It shows the quality of work that goes into the CD and it reflects in his singing+music
There is much, much, much better stuff to listen to.+N+Having been born in '86, I unfortunately did not yet exist to experience the late '70's punk movement or was too young to be part of the '80's hardcore years. Instead, I got to grow up with the MTV generation.... how so very lucky I am. Yet, I figured out the difference between real music and the junk mainstream media keeps referring to as "punk". So, if I could figure it out, any other idiot from this forsaken generation shouldn't have any problems. Good Charlotte is okay if you're 8 years old, but if you're 13 and you're still listening them you need to just grow up and listen to much better stuff. If you're my age and you listen to Good Charlotte then you are beyond any help.  Instead of Good Charlotte, buy or steal the real thing: Subhumans:Time Flies + Rats. It was the first one I picked up and it led to an entire collection of real, gritty, raw punk music. To all the Good Charlotte fans, take the advice I just gave you. Go from whining about how much your life sucks to actually doing something about it.+music
STRICTLY BALLROOM+P+Very good movie - fantastic lead dancer.  Music is good but a mix and not all danceable.  All in all good movie & good soundtrack. +music
Marc Bolan is Dead+N+Everybody seems to think this band is innovative or something. They sound exactly like 'Beard of Stars' era T-rex. Well, almost, because AC does a lot more layering with tons of effects. What are they hiding? The lyrics?  Anyway, if you're going to rip people off, you should give props. Shame on Animal Collective+music
My Second Favorite LP Of All Time+P+This is one of the greatest hip hop albums I've ever listened to. In my opinion, Murs has never sounded so good. His flows are vivid and realistic and the production fitted them to the Tee. I thought every song was extremely dope. I highly recommend this in your collection. I know this review will not make me popular w/many but I have to write it how I honestly feel. Save the negative remarks for someone who cares. I know Murs is not the best MC of all time. I'm not sayin that. He's far from it. I'm sayin this is my 2nd favorite album of all time simply for the overall feelings I get from it every time I put it on. I'm sure if you want some heart-felt/feel-good Hip Hop music this will suit you. Peac+music
One of the worst bands of all time!+N+Alright, I will state that I was curious about this band about four years ago. I thought to myself: "Good Charlotte can't be that bad if they have so many 'hardcore' fans that go everywhere, buy everything and speak anything that is to do with Good Charlotte." Man, was I wrong. Good Charlotte sucks. They're basically a boy band that wears black clothes and wears eyeliner. Their music sounds like sped up emo music. You could describe their music as "emo with estrogen". MTV markets them to the teenybopper crowd. How so many young, impressionable kids can get suckered hook, line, and sinker into ANY of the garbage that this pathetic excuse of a band dumps onto them is beyond me. They definitely appeal to 12 year old kids, who have such a horrible life because they can't go to the mall and buy new clothes or get a new video game.  They are a whiny band that love to sing about how "horrible" and "tragic" their life is, meanwhile they are sitting in cash in their mansions. No one cares except for their legions of self-pitying fans who feel they can truly connect with GC's "deep" and "inspiring" so-called "music". They even have whiny ballads that sound like the rest of the "pop-punk" and "emo" genres at the moment. Yeah, GC is fuelled by teen angst and armed with extremely bad talent. I'm sorry kiddies but Good Charlotte is nothing more than pop. I'm 16 & I'm already getting tired of the new music because it is getting horrible & more horrible. It's a manufactured popularity contest now. With their mediocre cliched song lyrics, Good Charlotte are 100% worshipped by their demographic, pre-teen and teenage preppy girls (and flamer guys.) This group of pop icons do nothing more than create crappy music (which is charged to audiences at well over $50 per ticket) and find themselves on MTV acting like jackasses every chance they aquire for the pleasure of their braindead viewers.  Their fanbase consists of 12 year olds that think they know all about music, therefore claim that they have the right to say that "GC" are musical gods or are the "best punk rawk band eva!111!1!", while talented bands like The Beatles and Pink Floyd to them are "old" and "horrible". These 12 year olds can usually be found online, usually on message boards, with usernames like "XxGCIsDaBestPunkBandEvarxX" and "trU3_pUnk_raWk3r".  Conversations between members of their fan base may be similar to this:  Poser: I love Good Charlotte they're so punk they're so much cooler than all those other pop bands. Kid #2: Where did you hear them first? Poser: TRL, oh, and in Hot Topic.  Poser: Hey, wanna, like, go to a Good Charlotte concert next month? Poser 2: Yeah! And we can wear our studded bracelets and red and black pants that we bought at Hot Topic!  Teenybopper talking to herself: "Oh my gaaaawd. I hate my liiiife. I can relate to these guys sooooo much because nobody listens to me and everyone hates meee"  Ugh.  In the end, I recommend the following punk rock albums to those who have been victimized by Good Charlotte:  Raw Power - Iggy and the Stooges Ramones - The Ramones London Calling - The Clas+music
In A Landscape = unmatched beauty+P+In my opinion, John Cage's In A Landscape is THE most beautiful peice for piano of absolute all time.  Never has there been a classical peice for this instrument that truely got to me personally than this.  And never will there ever be.  In A Landscape goes beyond 'music' and is an entity in itself that speaks on many levels.  It's so simple and yet is so powerful.  This is a must for any music lover or/and a person who would like to get to know the many works of John Cage+music
Para mi el es el mejor...+P+No importa lo que haga, no importa lo que cante, el es el mejor.  Yo no tengo que escuchar un disco de el para comprarlo, el solo hecho de que sea el es suficiente para mi.  Me gusto el disco y me encanto su nuevo look+music
Stadium Blow Out+P+For some Born in the USA is the greatest the Boss ever delivered, for others it's the start of a steady decline. Often mistaken for an overly patriotic statement this album found Bruce suddenly among the ranks of eighties superstars as Prince, Madonna and Michael Jackson. Born in the USA is the reason why some place the Boss in the same category as Jon Bon Jovi, Born in the USA sounds as a stadium blow-out. Yet lyrics as "Born down in a dead man's town, The first kick I took was when I hit the ground, You end up like a dog that's been beat too much, Till you spend half your life just covering up" could hardly be called patriotic or shallow.  Born in the USA was the follow-up for Nebraska, a sparse demo-like recording. A lot of the material here was culled from those sessions and had the E-Street bravura added to them. The title track was originally a one-man rockabilly outing but transformed in E-Street synth-rock. The same treatment songs as Dancing in the Dark, Glory Days or I'm on Fire got. It's that treatment that's ultimately the weakness of the record. Today Born in the USA sounds hopelessly dated at times. The listener is forced to listen beyond the production for its depth and meaning. At the time of its release it was no different. A lot of the lyrics meanings tend to get lost in the poppy production that made it so successful. It is also one of Springsteen least cohesive efforts. The styles on the album range from pop to rockabilly, from stadium rock to folk. For those who take the effort to dig deeper into the record there is a wealth in the songs that is rarely matched by other artists.  As never before Springsteen paints a picture of those of us who fail to be a part of the American Dream. There is the obvious post-Vietnam protest song of the title track, not allowing us to forget, and its attack on Reaganism. But there is more. In I'm on Fire the character bears his soul as Bruce sings, "At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet, and a freight train running through the, middle of my head, Only you can cool my desire". Sex being the means through which the character forgets his angst for just a moment. Similar sentiments are found in Dancing in the Dark, Bruce's ultimate pop effort. "Man I'm just tired and bored with myself" screams the character, "Hey there baby, I could use just a little help", hardly a light and upbeat lyric. The people in Springsteen's songs seem to be stuck in their lives, unable to get ahead. The chances the American Dream offers us are accessible only to just some of us. The rest are left behind "just sitting back trying to recapture, a little of the glory of, well time slips away and leaves you with nothing mister but, boring stories of glory days"+music
Nothing more to say that hasn't already been said, but . . .+P+They've inducted that Macolm Mclaren money-making hype "punk" band the Sex Pistols into the Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame (McLaren's other great creation was Bow Wow Wow) who arrived two years after the CBGB thing in New York in '74 (Brit kids seeing the Ramones on tour was far more influential on the punk scene there than anything the pistols did). Those laughable geezers Black Sabbath have been inducted (though they had their moments in their early albums). Even Billy Joel is an inductee (thanks to the evil & damned for eternity Jann Wenner)!! But neither the Stooges nor Iggy are to be found listed; their first album came out in 1969, which would have made them elegible in 1994; 12 years of tripe. A lot of people need to get a lot of hate mail for this omission. Then again, perhaps NOT being in the R'nR hall of fame is the last sign of integrity as this genre of music truly dies a slow, ugly, painful death (see "alternative" music since the early '90's leading to the likes of Avril Levine or . . . or any other "serious", "sensitive" "hip" whiney, over-hyped, worthless bands these days). +music
Disappointed Longtime Fan+N+Some of us have been through years where the Beastie Boys were always playing in at least one of the tape decks in our dual tape players (that's cassette tapes, in case you are too young to know).  Anyway, I was hoping for another album that would stay (now in my 5-disc changer) for at least a full year without my having to swap it out.  Unfortunately, this is not what I got in this album.  While there are tracks on this album that capture the energy and passion of the Beastie Boys of old, too much of this record feels like preaching. Although I agree with much of what they have to say, they now do so in such a politically over-hyped fashion that it detracts from their music.  Truly, there are some great songs on this record.  But if you listen to this album and then to Paul's Boutique, Licensed to Ill or another great one, you will quickly realize that this is not the Beastie Boys who revolutionized music in the late 20th century+music
I've got some issues with this CD+N+First of all, Jump is too good of a track. I still haven't heard the rest of this CD because I just put jump on repeat and rap at the top of my lungs on my 45 minute commute. It ends up being about 10 times each way to work and if I'm at a long light, I look a little nuts for rapping to the song twice, but like I've always told people, if yelling a rap song by 12 year olds at the top of your lungs is wrong, I don't want to be in prison. The other problem I have with this thing is that if you try to be like Kriss Cross, you can't hold a job. If you are a true Kriss Krosser, you braid your hair and wear your clothes backwards. I got a job with a bank when I graduated from the U of Phoenix and I showed up on my first day with my suit on backwards. I started getting a bunch of customer complaints and they would call my Manager, Mr. Gingercrap, up to tell me they had a problem with my attire. Little did they know that I wired the intercom system to play Jump by the rap kings. I just pushed play and got on the drive thru teller mic and busted a groove in my reverse suit. I got fired. Well, after getting fired six other times from places like Burger King, Jiffy Lube, Ted pants shack, Jorks and Microsubs I decided to be a roller rink cop. I make kids leave the floor if they skate too fast. If they resist my orders, I have a tazer that I use without hesitation. I usually whisper for them to leave the rink so they say they can't hear me. Stop! Tazer time!! They don't care how I dress and pay me like 5 buks an hour. Yup, I'm at another level+music
Live In Paris: EVANESCENCE+P+I first need to say, if it weren't for the DVD and all of its features, ANYWHERE BUT HOME would have gotten three stars. I say this because, Evanescence does not sound as good live as they do in the studio.   THE CD: This contains the audio to the rock band's performance live in Paris. It also has the album's most beautiful and stand out track: "Missing".  THE CONCERT: The overall sound balance for this rock band is way off for this performance and the distorted guitars tend to drown out anything in the form of a musical line. Amy Lee also has her share of troubles for this performance. She can sing her high loud notes pretty well, but her lower ones tend to be in a constant use of pedal tones. Late into the performance, Amy's voice cracks and even starts to give out on her. She does however, know how to work the crowd. The bands newer tracks are well performed, and the covers they perform sound better than their own work. This is good and bad; it shows that Evanescence can play pretty well, but they need a lot more practice playing live and communicating with each other live. The best part to this concert is getting to see the beautiful Amy Lee perform and add new and very interesting introductions to some of the band's songs.  Awesome performances include: "Thoughtless" "Breathe No More" "Farther Away" "Bring Me to Life" "Whisper"  DVD FEATURES: This disc is awesome because it has so many features. It of course has Evanescence's performance in Paris. It also has music videos for "Going Under", "Bring Me to Life", "Everybody's Fool", and "My Immortal". There is also a hidden video icon of Evanescence's band symbol. When this is activated, another live performance of "Bring Me to Life" is played. The disc also has tons of rehearsal, bloopers, and on the road footage; including Evanescence's tour with Seether. The credits also have the audio to Evanescence's newest track "Missing". ANYWHERE BUT HOME is an interesting concert and a fun look into Evanescence's life, I recomend viewing it+music
Garbage !+N+Another great player selling out to sell more.  Seems like another outbreak of the Kenny bug.  I'm sure any jazz aficianado would agree with me when I say that Gerald Albright is a much more comprehensive player than this album suggets.   Check out the 'Live at Birdland West' album for a taste of what Mr. Albright is really about.+music
FANTASTIC+N+THIS IS A GREAT CD IF YOU ARE A MUSIC LOVER AS I AM.BILLY COBHAM IS ONE OF THE GREATEST DRUMMERS EVER!!!+music
Not worth listening unless you're collecting+N+I purchased Hotel Costes backwards from 6,5,4 and then 2. I don't know why I skipped 3 and bought 2 first.  But 3 and 1 isn't worth listening to, unless you want the whole collection of the Hotel Costes series+music
Disappointing effort from an otherwise solid act+N+I wanted to like BROTHERHOOD, for the simple reason that nearly every New Order fan this side of the galaxy has dismissed it, usually with a faint whiff of snobbery (or at least apathy). Turns out they were right: BROTHERHOOD is half an album. Most of its nine songs feel unfinished, as if the band wanted to cash in on the success of their 1985 smash LOW-LIFE and didn't care about the end result. BROTHERHOOD is a rush job, plain and simple, but there are still glimmers of hope within this bare-bones effort.   "As It Is When It Was" overcomes the album's overall muddy production by dint of being mostly acoustic, and the melody is quite lovely. "All Day Long", the emotional centerpiece of the album by default, is an intelligent (if half-hearted) protest against child abuse. While "Angel Dust" lacks a decent hook, its subtly danceable beat and effective synth noodlings will at least briefly hold your interest. And the toss-off "Every Little Counts" has a charming sense of humor that is too often lacking in New Order's work.  The most popular song on BROTHERHOOD is, of course, "Bizarre Love Triangle". So good it seems to belong to a different album entirely, "Bizarre Love Triangle" is truly New Order's masterpiece. The solid beat, slick sequencer work, and gorgeous melody showcase the band at their best: catchy, danceable, and downright euphoric. (Imagine how well it would have fit on LOW-LIFE.)  Sadly, the rest of BROTHERHOOD is unremarkable. The album's production neatly mixes rock with electronic flourishes, which has become New Order's signature sound, but the songwriting doesn't measure up. Buy the album if you're a trainspotter, but casual New Order fans would be better off picking up LOW-LIFE or 1983's POWER, CORRUPTION AND LIES. This one is just a footnote.+music
Cosmic+N+Somewhere in the universe, statistically speaking, there has to be a band more stultifying than Rush. It's hard to imagine that God could be so cruel, but remember, she gave us Boston (the band, that is) too. This stuff is so painful, it almost makes rap sound good+music
girly chick lit+N+god forbid i be so bold as to trash a classic.  and yes, maybe because of all the raving reviews from my friends and from the book's great reputation, i entered it with high expectations. - which the book however did not satisfy.  yes, it is a good comedic parody of the upper class of the time, a lampoon of the courtship ritual, and of course oh so witty, blah blah blah, but it just wasn't my cup of tea.  the main character was likeable, but that aside, i found it completely insufferable to read through, and absolutely painfully boring.  every subsequent event from the very beginning could be predicted, let alone the ending.  not that anything really ever happens - the entire book could be summed up with, "then they walked and talked and had tea and walked and talked and had tea, walked and talked and had more tea, then got married and lived happily ever after."  the entire novel was a headache of girly gossip and mental drama.  it would save more time just to watch a chick flick.  so if you're interested in the relationship fiascos of fictious characters, witnessing the agony over who's going to marry who (even though the reader could already predict the happily-ever-after match-making light-years in advance), then this is the book for you!!  if not, then i suggest picking up some dan brown.           +music
WHAT A GREAT COLLECTION OF SONGS FROM A GREAT BAND!+P+First of all i love the pet shop boys they take me back to the decade of the 80's with this collection!!!! Each song has a untique flavor to them and they are so much fun to listen to again and again!!!!! With the beginning of the album which would be "West End Girls" to " Jealously"!!!!!! If you love the pet shop boys then go buy this album not because of the band,but for the great 80 songs that take us back in the day!!!+music
NO PARENTAL ADVISORY+P+Old school. If you have a teen into rap this is a great alternative to "SHOW THE PUPS" how it was done before all women were treated as dirt in videos and and gangsters were hero's. The topic is party. the beat is rap/rock and it the "BOYS" influenced many of todays artists. And the infamous Brass Monkey song is still HOT HOT HOT. If you're a fan of any rap or roc or a parent that wants to add some depth to your teen's gangster heavy library-head to the old school kind of cool and you will find music you can both live with+music
Best Rap Group There Will EVER Be+P+This is undoubtably the Beasties' best CD. There still great now, but on here they're more Rap/Rock, which they left behind later on for straight up rap/hip-hop, which isn't a bad thing. Most rap nowadays really sucks goats(*cough*cough50centmikejonesliljonseanpaulpaulwall *cough*cough). This great disc features such classics as Girls, No Sleep Til' Brooklyn(the Beasties best song), Rymin and Stealin(which has a rather nice tribute to The Clash), Fight For Your Right, Hold it Now Hit It, And the infamous Brass Monkey. If you're a fan of any rap or rock, I highly reccomend this amazing CD+music
Dream Theater couldn't get any better, but did they have to get worse?+N+I'm a huge fan of Dream Theater, owning all their studio albums, and some singles. I loved SFAM, I&W, SDOIT, and Awake. After their peak at SFAM, I didn't expect them to release anything better. But I didn't expect them to release anything that was too bad.  They did.  Octavarium, flat out, isn't Dream Theater. No guitar or drum solos, not flourishes, no pretenstious and self-indulgent metal peices. Buy this if you like U2 or Coldplay, don't buy it if you like Dream Theater.+music
Must...Destroy...ABBA...BLEARGH!+N+Seriously, folks...this band SUCKS! Every one of these hits (Dancing Queen, Sugar Sugar, Mamma Mia, Take a Chance on Me) is dated, sugary, and awful as awful gets. How they scored any hits whatsoever is beyond me. KEEP AWAY!!!!!!!+music
Great Drinking Album!+P+Break down and burn your fence for this one. It is worth the fumes. I was living in a place in Tucson for this release and we burnt the whole fence down+music
One of the reasons I hate radio...+N+Nelly is one of the most annoying ignorant rappers I have ever heard. I do give him props on his first album, but he went downhill and started that whole "I can make great club beats, but write bubblegum lyrics over it" trend. This sadly created all the Chingys, Lil Johns and so on. The guy doesn't add any substance to his music, yet he sells millions thanks to MTV. Just save your money on real artist that makes real music+music
Excellent+P+Passion, a collection of some of the most popular young worship leaders (including Chris Tomlin, Charlie Hall, Matt Redman and David Crowder) released Hymns Ancient & Modern in 2004. There is some interpretation of the hymns, and a couple have a chorus added to them, but on the whole the artists stay quite close to the traditional tunes. To "O Worship The King," for example, Chris Tomlin adds the chorus, "You alone are the matchless King / To you alone be all majesty / Your glories and wonders, what tongues can recite? / You breathe in the air, You shine in the light." Some of the standouts on this album are "The Solid Rock," "All Hail the Power of Jesus' Name," and "All Creatures of Our God and King." The liner notes include a brief description of each of the songs along with information about the author. It is quite a good album if you enjoy the "Passion" sound and are able to enjoy hymns with a bit of a worship music feel to them+music
My ears are throwing up!+N+Wack rhymes make me puke via my ear canal. That's how wack Paul Wall is. After I have eaten a full meal and listened to Paul wall, My dinner is regurgitated through my ears. I am sooooooooooo tired of these garbage rappers polluting the airwaves with garbage. This guy wouldn't know lyrical content if I slapped him with a Mos Def CD+music
great momentum and continuity+P+The first CD is 5 stars.  It has great continuity that carries over from track to track.  The combination of vocals and non-vocals is just right because you don't feel burnt out by one or the other.  One of the cooler parts about the first CD is tracks such as Under the Sun make excellent use of your left and right speaker channels.  There is this weird echo effect that moves from your left to right speaker that is amazing if you have a good sound system.  Normally music makes inefficient use of the speaker channels, but a few songs selected by Armin goes against this trend.  These days there is a lot of good electronic music out there, but messing with the speaker channels immerses you even more in the acoustic environment.  All the songs Armin picked become remember able classics once you hear them several times because a few do sound monotonous.  The second CD is 3 stars.  It doesn't have the energy and momentum that CD1 has and there aren't as many vocal tracks to break up the electronic beats.  Armin could probably have introduced more variety into CD2 such as breakbeat, house, and tribal, but it is what it is.     +music
Re-Record?????? Paging Miss Emily!!!!+N+Despite all the rave reviews I'm wondering if this is a dreaded rerecord. Maybe I'm paranoid, but the country music industry is so sleazy. And some stars feel entitled to cash in. How else can you explain the John Anderson Anthology...Horror.  (John, how could you?) Or the Bill Anderson Oh Boy Classic [Oh boy here comes a rerecord). Hey, the CD sounds great. But what makes me suspiscious is that there are no copyright dates anywhere on this CD except for one. Also the cryptic message on the inside sleeve.  Could someone please clear this up. And not some RCR Bud Logan shill either. John Conlee is one of my hero's and this is really worrying me. I can't look at this CD with Rose Colered Glasses anymore+music
Seductive Intelligent wonderful+P+Ever since they vanished from the music world, I've been searching the airwaves for just a hint of anything "Catherine Wheel" and then BLAM I hit Rob Dickinson's solo album while slogging through I-tunes.  Ahhh that voice....Ahhh those lyrics...seductive, intelligent.....wonderful. I'm in love with music once again.+music
And now it's time for another hate review+N+Well what the hell to expect from a big cynical misanthrope such as myself?  Flowery bubbly warm rays of sunshine?  HELL NO!  You see folks it's people like Lil Jon that make me think in such a morbid manner.  When I see Special Ed. failures who look and act like mental house rejects make lots of money I tend to get a little pessimistic.  BUT CAN YOU BLAME ME?  Seriously, let's screw our heads on tightly and think about this for a second, why would a sane person actually listen to let alone actually purchase this cd?  This is a complete joke.  I'm simply calling it like I see it.  Lil Jon deserves no respect from any human being, not even his crack head of a mother.    Actually you might as well compare Lil Jon to Elmo, Elmo being a puppet has a MILLION times more skill at what he does.  At least Elmo is a good and wholesome children's icon that kids can have fun with.  If I ever have a kid someday Elmo will still be a hit with the kids but Lil Jon will still be laughed at once all his "fans" grow up and realize how stupid they were to actually buy into his garbage he pans off as "music".  Meh, well who I am kidding this review (like my last 6) probably won't even get posted anyway. +music
misleading at best+N+It's simply not the best of Sting '84-'94.  The version of We'll Be Together (a great song) is an alternate take (mix?), VASTLY inferior to the album / radio version.  It's anemic.  Lacks the punch.  In a word -- sucks.  That you're not told this on the cover is misleading.  I really enjoy Mr. Sumner's music.  All the other tunes are as they should be, and they are terrific.  4-5 stars.  But don't buy this product if you expect to hear what you've heard on the album or the radio+music
Sting is the MAN!+P+I have been a fan of Sting ever since I was in college.  I actually got to see him in person in the late 80's.  I have just about every cd he has ever put out so when this one did I ran right out and bought it.  Every song on it is great and it IS one of my most favorite cd's I own.   +music
An Excellent Sting Collection+P+After leaving The Police in 1984, Sting launched a hugely successful solo career, garnering top selling albums and a string of top forty hits. In 1994, A & M released "Fields Of Gold: The Best Of Sting 1984-1994", a 14 song collection containing almost all of Sting's hits up to that time as well as some new recordings.  Well, 10 years has passed since its release, and Sting has made some new recordings. So the question is, how does "Fields Of Gold" hold up? Here are the positives and the negatives.  Positives: -If you're a casual fan only interested in having Sting's radio hits, than this collection is for you, as it includes "If You Love Somebody (Set Them Free)", "Fortress Around Your Heart", "Be Still My Beating Heart", "Russians", "We'll Be Together", "All This Time", "If I Ever Lose My Faith In You" and "Fields Of Gold". So basically, all the hits you could possibly want are here. -The sound is great. -It is a very afforable and easy to find compilation. -It includes some songs recorded for the album that are only available here. They're all good songs, especially the hit single "When We Dance".  Negatives: -This collection is missing a top twenty hit: "Love Is The Seventh Wave" reached number 17 in 1986. That's my main caveat. -"Mad About You" was never a single (at least in the U.S.) but received a lot of airplay, enough to warrant inclusion on this cd. -Some of these songs are remixes. However, they work, though I prefer the original version of "We'll Be Together". -No liner notes. -As I said, this collection is leaving out later hits like "I'm So Happy I Can't Stop Crying", "Brand New Day" and the top twenty hit "Desert Rose". So if you want to get those songs, you'll have to get the albums they're on.  Overall, "Fields Of Gold" holds up very well. It is completely unneccessary for hardcore Sting fans (unless they're completists), but if you're a casual fan, than you must own this collection+music
The Pig Has Been Butchered...+N+Sorry...  I expected the original lineup when I purchased this CD.  Now I'll have to go looking for all the songs that are missing...  Buyer Beware+music
My Favorite &quot;Nearly Unknown&quot; Show+P+A great show makes a great CD. I will never understand why this show didn't become a hit! I saw this show at a local amateur theater and have loved it ever since. Maltby and Shire are the best composer and lyricists to never have a successful B'way show. This score is great- Fatherhood Blues, I Want It All, The Story Goes On, The Ladies Singing Their Song- These are unforgetable and deserved to be heard. Get this gem+music
One of the most overrated albums in rap's history+N+Before getting steamed at the title of my review, take time and read my review in an objective sense. My critical anaylsis of this album was done strictly as objective as possible. I took my time listening to every single "song" on this album, so this isn't an uninformed review. Now to the review. ------------------------------------------------------------  Hell on Earth, Mobb Deeps third release, came out during the era of the media-fabricated and infamous east-coast-west-coast beef. Throughout the album, you get a sense that the artist where suffucated by the negative climate of the time. The songs and lyrics on this album, in every way, reflect that era. Starting off the album is a deep bass mixed with a dark-drum line instrumental. Havoc and Prodigy lace the beat with self glorifying, tough guy lyrics that accentuate the grimy instrumental. Though this album has 14 tracks, you've be hardpressed to differentiate one from the other if it wasn't for the switch of beat. The level of variation in subject matter on this album is so limited that a review of one tracks lyrics will tell you all you need to know about the album, lyric wise. There are little to no song concepts on this album. Nearly every single track on Hell on Earth is polluted with numerous references to someone getting shot, how much better Prodigy and Havoc are than you, and how they are from Queensbridge, etc. Through the lyrical context of this album, you almost get the sense that Mobb Deep was too consumed with the negative climate of rap at the time. You get the sense that they're lashing out at anyone and everyone that may pose as a potential threat to them. Cuts like "Drop a gem on them" and "Bloodsport" find them verbally attacking the late Tupac Shakur. The lyrics on this album get so rediculous at times that you have to wonder what these guys were thinking. You truely have to sit back and question how these guys could put out track after track of the same tired material. About the only saving grace of this album is the instrumentals. Dark, grimey, and horror movie like, they paint a background of horror and terror. Though good, the instrumentals of this album also start to sound repetitive as you get deeper into the album. After a while, they all start to sound like a cluster of the same stuff.  I'm sorry, but in no way shape or form is this as great of an album as some have stated. Lack of variation in topics, Ignorant, mindless gun and thug brovado give this album no depth. If you're someone that is looking for intelligent lyrics or creative concepts, do yourself a favor and avoid Hell on Earth at all cost+music
Flippin Awesome!+P+I love Saving Jane and the songs off this album are GREEAT! It's flippin awesome times a gazillion,a MUST BUY! Saving Jane ROCKS, no doubt!&lt;33+music
Obnoxious and embarrassing+N+This musician, if you can call him that, should be embarrassed.  If he has something to say, more people would listen if he didn't use such vulgar language and stopped talking about his body parts.  I won't be buying this and my kids won't either.  Repulsive+music
Precious Memories+P+Alan Jackson is my favorite country singer. This is one of my favorites. I love every hymn that he has done. I play it constantly and it brings back memories. His wife and daughter did very well. One of his best!! +music
takes you back+P+all college students should watch st. elmos fire and all 80's babies should get the soundtrack to remind them the good ol days+music
Soulful, Funky and Soothing+P+Eric Clapton speaks to the heart and soul and makes you smile and bop every time you listen.  He takes you out of your current space and into other places, leaving you enriched by the journey+music
WHAT A BUNCH OF MALARKY!+N+WHAT A LOUSY MOVIE! AND I READ NOTHING BUT GLOWING REVIEWS ABOUT THIS CONVOLUTED PIECE OF BAD ACTING, BAD STORIED MOVIE. PLEASSSEEE, SAVE YOUR MONEY THIS IS A BAD MOVIE, BORING AND ALL-AND-ALL A LOUSY STORY. I DON'T RECOMMEND IT+music
Should a comedy album feature pity laughter?+N+Do you remember the guy in high school or college who tried to be the class clown but failed miserably? Well, Eugene Mirman is less entertaining than that guy.  I'm not being sarcastic about the pity laughter... that's the most laughter here, and yes, this was recorded live. How the record company heard this and still felt comfortable releasing it is beyond me. Perhaps it's a tax write-off+music
Putting Jewel On the Map+P+This album is the single reason Jewel is what she is today.  Without this album I feel that Jewel would never have been able to establish herself musically, at least not to the point of success she has today.  Raw, Untraditional, Brave, Naked, these can all descibe her first album.  Unlike most other hit records this album is a nice departure from the norm.  Worth a listen+music
Insulting+N+Do you think if I wrote some nursery rhyme lyrics from bizzaro world and starting singing in a voice more suited to Sesame Street that I could get a record contract too like Devendra Banhart? His record has to be some kind of inside joke, or the efforts of one seriously untalented individual. Sprouting nonsensical phrases one after the other might pass as genius among some people but I want a bit more substance to my music. I found this record personally insulting because it's obvious that someone out there felt you can just put out any old crap filled with "strange and fantastic" lyrics that are ultimately meaningless and people would evitably go out and buy it because it's 'unique' and that your uncool if you don't get 'it' (whatever 'it' is). If you want to listen to a quality record by a singer-songwriter than go check out Bright Eyes' "I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning" or Damien Rice's "O" and steer clear of this insult to good taste+music
rip off+N+This music is a rip off. All is borrowed to the 4 first albums of Marc Bolan playing under the name of Tyranosaurus Rex. Something more bluesy here and there but nothing allowing to give any credit to this guy.  A shame+music
Great first single!+P+I saw the music video for this song a few days ago and it was stuck in my head for days! Canadian singer Daniel Powter is definitely talented, and it shows in his first single. I cannot wait for his self-titled album to be released in October so that I can listen to the rest of the songs.+music
This cd truly made a revolution in my world!+P+This is the first T.M.R. cd I ever bought and it truly made me into a fan. It's got great upbeat songs like Abort//Clear and Out of Orbit and classics like Invoke (gundam Seed) and Heart of Sword (Rurouni Kenshin). He has a truly unique voice and can really touch your soul. (Even if you can't understand what he's saying, it's cool. Go look for translations then!) Anyway, I reccomend this cd to any Jpop or Jrock fan. He truly is a great artist that I think you'll enjoy time and time again. 5stars baby 5 stars! Holla+music
WICKED!!!+P+I love T.M. Revolutions music, it is just so upbeat and so awesome their are hardly any words !  I love this CD, I listen to it all the time!  My favorite tracks are Invoke, Meteor, and Heart of Sword!  He is such an awesome singer!  I highly recommend his music to anyone who is into jpop or wanting to get into jpop! +music
The answer is no+N+During Pearl Jam's riot act tour in 2003, Sleater Kinney was  the opening band.I got tickets for the show. In preperation  for the concert, I picked up a few kinney albums. First this one. For one I had heard songs at the college station I worked and since one member Janet weiss was in Quasi( a great band) I thought it couldn't be all bad. At  first listening to the albums it was alright. Then it got  annoying. Those high pitched screams from the singer began to be fingernails on a chalkboard. Repetitive, middle of the road punk. Then came the concert. Once Sleater hit the stage, everyone and I mean everyone around me had no clue who they were. They were all asking me, who's this? I had to tell them all. No one was digging the concert. Minamal applause. No dancing or cheering, nothing. The songs that night didn't flow. The usual screaming was,as always, ear screeching and annoying. A few people mis-took the bassist for a man, but we were in the nose-bleed seats. Once sleater-kinney did their  last song and walked off stage the audience clapped with much enthusiasim, cause they knew they were finally done+music
What the game's been missin?  Not you +N+Maybe it's just me and I'm expecting so much when I spend my money or a little bit of time listenin' to these new n*ggas. But I'm just not feelin' this s*it here. I fell asleep mid way through this album. I just can't seem to understand why these n*ggas is so one dimesional. I cant underdstand why people still supportin' these n*ggas. Not one track was tolerable. If dis cd belonged to me i would threw this s*it away already. Word of advice dont buy this.+music
Ja Rule - Blood in My Eye+P+After Ja Rule rose in popularity throughout the years since his debut, "Venni Vetti Vecci" in 1999, now in 2003 lots of things have changed.  50 Cent and his G-Unit crew rose up from the streets of New York and took the rap game by storm and their goal was to destroy Ja Rule and expose him as a poser.  After numerous disses throughout the years when 50 and his clique were in the underground scene til 2003, Ja Rule's career slowly began to crumble before his eyes.  So with this release, "Blood in My Eye," Ja is out to prove that he still got that gangsta s*** in him.  Can Ja turn his career back around or will it further put him in the grave?  1. Murder (Intro) - No Rating  2. The Life (Featuring Hussein Fatal, Caddillac Tah & James Gotti) - 4/5  3. Clap Back - Minute+ Talking Intro - 4/5  4. The Crown (Featuring Sizzla) - 4/5  5.

The Wrap (Freestyle)[Bonus Track](Featuring Hussein Fatal) - 3.5/5  Overall:  41/50  4 Stars  Ja Rule does indeed return to his roots.....somewhat.  Mostly every track has Ja spitting with anger dissing 50, Eminem, DMX, Dr. Dre and mostly every other rapper who dissed him.  He still got some pretty hot radio tracks but most of the album is filled with semi-hardcore tracks.  This was the first "flop" in Ja Rules career.  This album barely pushed over 400,000 units to date.  Still a pretty good record though, check it out+music
Blood in my stool+N+This is what occured when I heard this album. I immediately had to run to the bathroom and crap my life out. And guess what?!?!?!?!?! There was blood in my stool. Damn you jeffery for polluting this world with your awful lyrics, curse you for wasting beats, and shame on you for calling this album "blood in my eye" when you don't even know the history behind the book called "blood in my eye". Listen to us Ja quit rapping and go work at kfc+music
Garbage.....+N+This is an awful record.  The beats are a complete joke.  Whoever produced this crap must have been strung out or somethin', cuz no1 in there right mind would let this sh** see the light of day.  And everyone already knows ja can't write so it's expected that the lyrics would be trash too.  Forget this record.  Murder Inc is dead+music
Wonderful experience+P+I had the opportunity to see Tom Braxton play for an extremely happy crowd at his almamader, Dunbar Middle School (then Dunbar High School). "Julian's Smile" and "Bounce" are superbly played, smoothe and fresh sound. See him live if you get the chance, buy the CD anyway+music
A Child's Celebration of Rock 'n' Roll+P+My daughters and I love this CD.  It is fun to sing along and we have a great time listening to it.  I think that the songs provide my children with exposure to older music which is much different from the sounds they usually listen to.  We really enjoy it for how fun and invigorating it is to listen to+music
GREAT RINGSIDE SEAT FOR BEST CD OF 2005 !!+P+my favorite songs are "she really wants you", "video", and  "little bombs". excellent album. her 2nd best beside bachelor no.2+music
Fantastic+P+This is definitely one of those albums that you can play over and over again and discover something new and brilliant each time.  The lyrics are brilliant, the melodies are beautiful and the music is simply enchanting.  Shannon McNally has really found her stride with this album.  Personal favs include "Pale Moon" "The Hard Way" and her cover of Taj's "Lovin' In My Baby's Eyes." +music
destinctively colored cd+P+excellent recording, very destictively colored music....I was impressed and am listening to it quite frequently.+music
Easily their best album!+P+Echo Echo is a marvelous fusion of alternative, punk and Irish folk music. It is by far their best album+music
Fake! Fake! Fake!+N+I bought one of these CD's many years ago and found out the hard way.  What a joke and a ripoff.  No original artists and nowhere on the CD does it say this.  I never bought another one. +music
Hate Hate Hate+N+I think they put the wrong cd in the case because most of sublimes good stuff is missing.  Weird.  Buy 40oz to freedom or anything other than this cd if you do not already have them.  It's has some good songs but false advertisement comes to mind.  Hardcore sublimers may want it, but you never really have to open it.     +music
Well, At Least It's Better Than Brave New World!!!+N+When I listened to this CD I actually expected to hear Gloria Estafan singing on some of these songs.  Some of them seem like they were written for her.  Wild Card has a few good songs on it.  The title track is okay.  Moonlight and King Of Hearts are better.  The last good CD by the Rippington's was Weekend In Monaco.  Changes in personnel, locations, and labels haven't proved to be too good for Russ's music.  He's made his money and can experiment with various ideas.  Wild Card is loser in my opinion, but at least it's better than Brave New World+music
Incredible!!!!+P+This is one of the greatest CDs ever recorded. Jason Robert Brown is an amazingly gifted songwriter and an incredible vocalist. Not to mention he must have made some pact with Satan or something to be able to play the piano like that.   This CD has music that is catchy, thoughtful, sincere, and beautiful.   An amazine CD.+music
some wonderful songs but a boring album...+N+I'm a huge u2 fan but maybe I'm the only one on this world who doesn't like r.e.m. very much.I find songs like drive,everybody hurts and man on the moon(one of my favourite)very beautiful.But the other songs are boring and ripetitive.I don't know why people say that this is one of the best album in music.I hope one day I'll understand this band..+music
If you want GnR's Greatest Hits or Best of+N+then just pick up Appetite For Destruction  AFD was one of the greatest rock albums ever made.  I wanted to hate the album so much.  I was an alternative/avant guard snob when AFD was released.  To me, these clowns were just another hairspray band. But I took a long car trip with some chick I was banging and her roommate. The roommate played the tape at least three times on the trip.  By the end, I was hooked.  That's the mark of truly great art.  If it can draw in someone who's predisposed to hate it, its got something special.  I looked forward to the next album, G N' R Lies.  But when it came out, I was disappointed.  It was ok, but hardly the cultural epoch that was AFD.  Nice Boys was kind of fun. Used to Love Her was a humorous novelty song. Mama Kin was a decent cover, but no real improvement over the original.  The rest of the disk was just crap.  But what the hell, its was just an EP right? Something to tide us over until the next brutal masterpiece.  Then came GnR's death knell, the two Use Your Illusions.  Over-produced, bloated, boring and pretentious.  Everything I had always hated Hair-Metal for in the first place.  Gone was the sound of the alley ways of Sunset Boulevard, replaced by the sound of computers, maids and Beverley Hills hookers n blow parties.  Rock n Roll sung by a guy in custom-ripped jeans who just came out of a session with his hair stylist and manicurist.  Nothing to see here.  Move along.  So, if you want to see the genius and promise of GnR, just pick up Appetite For Destruction, and pretend they just broke up after creating one of the greatest albums of all time+music
JMM's first and best+P+An unfortunate trend amongst young male country singers from the early 1990s was to produce an outstanding, real country first album before veering down the path of increasingly pop-driven music. This was never more true than in the case of John Michael Montgomery, whose 1992 debut CD Life's A Dance is an undoubted 5 star release. Full of great stone country (Beer And Bones, Life's A Dance, Nickels And Dimes And Love - originally recorded by Charley Pride - and Dream On Texas Ladies), Montgomery's infectious vocal twang saw him immediately rack up the first of several country number ones. The album's biggest hit was the quality ballad, I Love The Way You Love Me. Unfortunately, as early as his second album Kickin' It Up (the title suggests more excitement than the album delivered), Montgomery's song selections became more MOR and less traditional country. His greatest hits CD is worth a listen, but if you want one JMM album in your collection, it has to be this, his first+music
More proof of P.T. Barnum's maxim+N+I made it half way through before piercing my eardrums with sharpened pencils.  If you can buy the karaoke version, this might be pretty good, otherwise you will get more artistry from the latest Yanni cd.  The vocals are so twee even a kindergartner would blush in shame+music
southern gospel? nightclub?  what is she doing?+N+There is a hint that Jessica has a good voice, but apparently she is not sure where she belongs.  Some of the songs have a southern Gospel feel, and I must confess, that personally, I do not like that wailing type of music.  But, if you do, you will like SOME of the tracks.  However, on other tracks, she uses this breathy quality, that I suppose, is trying to imitate a sexy nightclub singer.  These two styles do not work well together.  Except for die-hard Jessica fans, this is not a particularly good album.  It is ho-hum pop and even less attractive as Christmas music.  At times I am reminded of Marilyn Monroe singing "Happy Birthday, Mr. President."  The problem is that Marilyn was NOT known as a singer.  Jessica needs to rethink her presentation.  Only buy this album if you think Jessica is the greatest thing since Edison invented the light bulb.+music
THE DVD IS BAD, AS IN NOT WORTH WATCHING !!!!!+N+I READ ALL THE REVIEWS ABOUT THIS BOXED SET AND NOBODY EVER SAID THAT THE DVD IS SO DARK THAT MOST OF THE TIME YOU SEE A OUTLINE OF BRUCE ONLY. I DON'T CARE IF THIS IS A PIECE OF HISTORY, IF YOU CAN'T SEE THE MAIN PERFORMER THEN WHY WASTE THE SPACE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!THE ONLY PERSON THAT YOU CAN SEE GOOD IS THE SAX PLAYER BECAUSE HE'S WEARING A WHITE SUIT AND ONCE IN A WHILE THEY PUT A WHITE SPOT ON HIM. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY THE OTHER DVD'S.....................+music
Shock and Awe+P+I feel like such a fool!  This album is 6 years old and I heard it for the first time a few weeks ago.  What's more, I've since asked several of my friends who also love neo-soul music if they've heard it, and may of them didn't even know WHO I was talking about.  That is a crime, because this album is fantastic.  Fantastic, I say.  It's one of those albums where I did not have to look at the album credits to see who wrote and produced the songs.  It's obvious from how his voice perfectly compliments the music that his is not simply the voice chosen to sing these songs that someone else wrote.  This is what I appreciate most about the Neo-soul genre; the tendency for the artists who perform the music to be more than just singers.  They are musicians.  (This is what is so frustrating about Brian McKnight, incidentally.  He is a musician, but still refuses to sing in his vocal range.  Many of the songs that he has written for himself are too high for him!  That just shouldn't be)  In any case, go get this album if you like good music+music
My favorite Bob Dylan album+P+When Green Day changed up their sound around the mid-90's and came through with a more slickly produced, commercial sound, a lot of their loyal fans didn't like it. But what they seemingly forgot to look at amidst their curious anger is that Green Day's new stuff sounded really good ('Warning' especially), even though, yeah, it sounded quite a bit different.  When it comes to Bob Dylan, die-hard fans compare an album like Empire Burlesque  (and probably a couple before it) with the likes of Highway 61 Revisited and Bringing It All Back Home, and a lot of them not only don't like the change but are agitated with their sneaky hero, though his status as 'constantly-looked-up-to'  remains in tact.  Granted, as much as I like Empire Burlesque, it has to be careful with itself because as it goes from one song to the next you almost feel like you're going to hear this as a soundtrack for a really syrupy Cameron Crowe movie, and that's no good.  But Dylan's sensibilty doesn't go quite that far down the wimpy direction as he remains hard-hearted and overly introspective, even if fairly non-sensical at times.  I love songs like 'Tight Connection to My Heart'   'I'll Remember You'    'Emotionally Yours'   and 'Never Gonna Be The Same Again.' Though the disk sounds slicker than usual, it's a mistake to think the authenticity level dropped at all. If anything, he seems to be connecting with these songs at a higher degree than what is usual with him.  Another great thing about this album is that it's pretty consistent. A couple of the tunes are slighter but none of them are bad and they're all at least a litte above mediocre, with a high portion of it ranging from good to excellent. And that's saying a lot for someone like Dylan, who is so terribly inconsistent. Not long ago I listend to Planet Waves and there are 2-3 outrageously listenable songs there but so much of it is so mediocre.   I've always thought Dylan likes being disliked and that's why he puts out such terrible songs intermingled with all the stuff that's good.  He doesn't want people coming too close and that desire of his seems to draw his fans near all the more.  I saw Dylan in concert last year and he was on keyboards due to some kind of arthritis, or something. There was a guitar planted on the center of the stage and after every song Dylan walked over, with his back hunched over and his shoulders sulking, his white warm-up suit and cowboy hat making him look like a modern-day Texas circus hand. Once there he would walk around the vicinity of the guitar and oftentimes the crowd's screaming would peak, but every time Dylan did not pick up the guitar and instead slowly meandered over to his keyboards. Not once did he pick up the guitar that night but he led the audience to believe he would about 15-20 times. What a tease.   On Empire Burlesque he seems to have softened up and not minded creating something nice all the way through. And those strange actions of his which somehow draw his worshipers ever nigher are absent here, and I'm thankful for that+music
hello!!! what happened here???+N+Ok lets get right to the point veary chingon movie, lots of action good gangster s*** but this!!! I mean wheres the firme musica??? You would think with such a great movie the soundtrack to the movie would be so bueno but it just doesent grab my attention at all. I mean some of the songs are good like the one bye Funkadoobiest and Girls It Aint Easy bye the 4 Corners and the one bye Boss Catch Hit and Run but on these songs they are a different version of the songs not the ones like the way they were in the movie and they left some good songs out for instence, the one So Ruff so Tuff by Zapp and Roger great song!!! but not on there. Well I have them already it's just the point that they left some stuff out. Well... just understand me, in what i'm saying and get somthing else like the Bound By Honor soundtrack. Now thats a good one!!! as for the 1 in rating well you figure it out+music
Where are the original?+N+Harry Connick, Jr. did a fair job representing the musical legends that were found in the movie, but nonetheless, this soundtrack should contain the artists who created the songs and/or who were featured in the motion picture. If you are purchasing this CD because you enjoy the classics performed by musical legends, as I do, then I do not recommend this CD; instead I would buy the originals+music
When Harry Met Sally movie soundtrack+N+This CD is NOT the music soundtrack from the movie.  It's only some of the music that is in the movie.  I was very disappointed.  I wanted the original soundtrack of the music you hear when you watch the movie.  That's why I purchased it.  Is the original soundtrack NOT available or was it not produced?  I wouldn't buy this CD again.+music
Below Neal Schon's standard+N+I am pro-Neal Schon.  I own many of his solo efforts and every Journey album to date.  However, I honestly can't understand why everyone is rating this album with 5 stars.  It simply does not meet the mark on this one.    None of the tracks have a theme that will 'grab' you.  These aren't songs that will stick in your head.  Saying that this album is 'Neal exploring his melodic side' is pretty inaccurate.  If want to hear Neal's 'melodic side,' by "Beyond the Thunder...." one of his best to date.  These tracks are him basically exploring his improvisational side and jamming to a drum machine.  Even live drum tracks by a great drummer such as Omar Hakim sound as if they are programmed.  I was disappointed on this one.  Neal is an exceptional guitarist....one of the best in the world.  He just didn't hit the mark on this one. +music
A little catchy, pretty disappointing+N+It's more grown up than her previous albums in bad way.  I can't play a few of the songs with my kids around.  While the inappropriate songs may be catchy, it's disappointing that they had to be so "give it to me".  It's also missing the "rap/yodeling/soul" stuff that made me like her so much in the first album+music
More than surprised...+P+I heard "Dirty Harry" on Upop XM and began thinking about taking a chance on buying the album.  Then my wife came home one day and said she heard a song on a local station and really liked it-but she didn't know the title or artist.  The station helped when she emailed them and it turned out to be "Feel Good Inc" from the same album!  The choice was now clear!  Log on the Amazon! A first listen to the whole album was good, but not as good as I had anticipated. The second, third, and fourth listen hooked me good!  I even like the 2 cuts I first thought were terrible.  Now I will be getting a second album so I don't have to share+music
We need musiq like this now+P+Every track on da CD is hott. Itz a good CD to ride to at night & make love to.  The girlz can sing their ass off. I really didnt know anything about these girls until 1 of my girls put me on to them & i have had their CD play-n ever since.  Like i said all the trackz are hott but my personal favorites are Get up on It, Surrender,& Keep On. If you are think-n about get-n it-get it...you'll love it & if u dont something wrong wit your earz. Not like-n this is like say-n 12 Play is wack & u know everybody love 12 PLa+music
Missed Usher, but good soundtrack+P+Loved the movie and the music.  The soundtrack is good, but I was very disappointed not to have Usher's "Yeah" on the soundtrack - the dancing scene is one of the best parts of the movie for goodness' sake!  Oh well, still a good CD+music
Classic Cuts And New Sounds.+P+Just in time for their induction into the Rock N' Roll Hall Of Fame comes this new Blondie collection that showcases some of the band's most popular, influential songs, material from their recent releases and a mash-up with one of the bands that influenced them. "Sound & Vision," like most Best Of sets is both a good introduction to the band's music and a well-assembled collection for the casual listener who likes Blondie, but enough to purchase every album. There is no doubt that Debbie Harry and the gang not only produced good music, but were one of the main reasons why we have real chick rockers like Shirley Manson, Gwen Stefani and yes, Madonna. Befire Princess Diana ever graced magazine covers, Harry was the most photographed woman in the world but a real Punk at heart, posing at times with such figures as Joey Ramone and Iggy Pop (eventhough at one point Patti Smith told her to "get the f--k out of rock n' roll"). "Sound And Vision" nicely shows what all the fuss was about in the late 70's through mid-80's. A lot of the songs have survived the test of time with a real sense of fun and energy like "Call Me" with it's roaring chorus and electro sheen while "Heart Of Glass" is still a classic jam, disco has died and yet this song remains. "Rapture" is still a long, dreamy anthem that brought hip-hop to a wider audience before Aerosmith and Run DMC ever broke the barrier of rock and rap. Newer material is also present here, "Maria" was a single off the band's 1999 album "No Exit," but it still has that classic Blondie sound. However I do believe listeners are cheated here when it comes to the song "Good Boys" off their latest release, "The Curse Of Blondie." The original version is a great song, but the remix here makes the song kind of cold and hollow, the same for the "In The Flesh" remix which rips the song apart, turning it into cold, techno sludge. Luckily there is one worthy remix present, "Rapture Riders," which brilliantly meshes "Rapture" with The Doors' "Riders On The Storm." Both songs flow perfectly together and it's a fitting combination since Blondie have always named The Doors as a prime influence and favorite band. Too bad Jim Morrison died in 1972, you get the feeling he and Harry would have done a marvelous duet. The extra DVD that comes with the set is a must for Blondie fans, many of the band's videos are included for classics like "Heart Of Glass," "The Tide Is High" and even the recent videos for "Maria" and "Good Boys." "Sight In Sound" a fun ride through the Blondie catalogue and a must for collectors of classic rock anthologies, and a neat teaching tool for those who wanna know why girls like Gwen, Shirley and even Britney have been scandalous and glamorous and know how to pull it off and who they learned it from+music
Looks like Sting is loosing his touch+N+Wow, I sampled the songs on this new CD and I really am surprised at the drop in quality and uniqueness Sting used to bring to the music.  Like DeNiro and Pacino.  Where are they now?  Doing comedy and bland movies.  Not like the movies of yester-year when they were top notch.  Stings voice is still among the best in the world, just the music behind him is what makes his CDs bland and uninteresting.  I mean, Techno and Rap.  It's like a mundane chant, much like the Sting of the past used to sing out about.  It looks like the music industry of today is not only responsible for some of the most uninteresting music and groups it's also consuming those that used to be the best.  It's really a shame to see an artist like Sting decline in his work.  Brand New Day was the start.  Although it wasn't all bad, but you got the sense that he was lost or beginning to lose his way and his style.  Oh, well, albums like "Ten Summoner's Tale", "Nothing Like the Sun", "Soul Cages", and "Dream of the Blue Turtles" were the best of his solo career.  Now, he's just earning a paycheck.  Farewell Sting.  It was nice knowing you+music
USED HEART FOR SALE+N+IF YOUR A GARY ALLAN FAN I UNDERSTAND WHY.GARY'S VOICE IS GREAT BUT THE SONGS HE SINGS USUALLY [ARE WEAK].OF ALL HIS ALBUMS THIS IS THE WORST...+music
think I need a sunrise+P+Check out Augustana, without doubt last year's most promising new band, completely despite the fact that its own record label -- that'd be Epic, which has been in a tailspin since Polly Anthony left -- seems to have no clue whatever that they exist.  Their debut album, the extraordinary All the Stars and Boulevards, was tossed thoughtlessly into the marketplace a year ago and, minus even a modicum of press or publicity, got promptly crushed in the avalanche of fourth-quarter releases; its soaring title track -- one of `05's most potent -- was so thoroughly shunned by radio that it had to be a conspiracy.  So how's this for a dark horse story?  Practically as an afterthought as spring closed, Epic chose as Boulevards' second single the wistful, resplendent "Boston" and then sat on their dead, numb rumps while the song -- helped along by a simple but exquisite video that opens with a close-up of the band's twenty-one-year-old (!) lead singer Dan Layus (think 3 Doors Down's Brad Arnold with a more agile voice, and much much cuter) and fades to black with a shoreline of overturned pianos destroyed by the incoming tide -- built steadily, week on week, against all conventional wisdom which states that summer, with its easy melodies and breezy sentiments, is the wrong season in which to try to launch a complex, chorus-less single whose heroine is drowning in depression and desperation, and whose back half, in lieu of a repetitive refrain, rockets to a soul-cleansing, cobwebs-clearing climax so fiercely orgasmic you need a cigarette to regain your bearings.  Now there's some genuine heat swirling around the song -- enough so that Epic re-released Boulevards last week with extra tracks, an increasingly common industry practice that continues to just rankle me, if for no other reason than I'm enough of a lunatic to plunk down money twice for the same motherflippin' record, and that's what they count on, but if it helps Augustana become the raging success they richly deserve to be, all will be forgiven.+music
Bam!! This artist is over!!!!+N+I'm sick of this song!! It's overplayed...Can you people stop loving Green Day so much. They suck.+music
hip hop?+N+oh please, however catchy the beats are do not call her music hip hop,for some one who has been listen to it for years, calling her music hip hop is an insult+music
WORTH EVERY PENNY+N+AFTER LISTLENING TO THIS CD A COUPLE OF TIMES AND WATCHING DR. KNOW PLAY WITH BRANDON CRUZ I THINK THAT THIS CD IS WORTH EVERY PENNY.IF YOU CALL YOURSELF A DR. KNOW FAN AND DONT OWN THIS CD THEN YOU SHOULD SLAP YOUSELF RIGHT NOW.IT DOESNT MATTER IF ITS NOT KYLE TOUCHER ITS STILL DR. KNOW AND THEY KICK ASS AND BRANDON CRUZ IS A COOL GUY.ALSO THE METAL STUFF THAT KYLE DID KICKS ASS TOO, IF YOU ARE A FAN THEN YOU SHOULD CHECK THAT OUT TOO+music
soulless +N+It's incredible how a band with so much potential and a great debut could follow it up with such a dud. There is close to nothing capitvating or engaging on this record. The songs feel like poor B sides to the original album, and while nobody ever claimed them to be geniuses they WERE catchy, but even their keen pop sensibility is pretty much lacking here. Slightly amusing for one spin, but in the long run utterly fogettable. Not even worth your time to illegally download.+music
OH GOLLY+P+This is one of my most favorite CDs in the history of the universe. Great on rainy days...and sunny days...and medium days too. Its good allll the time. :)+music
She's really, really good -- why don't I like her?+N+Powerful voice. Mimics the styles of a variety of classic Hispanic singers.  Incredible range of material.  But, unlike Lhasa de Sela or Astrid Hadad, she leaves me flat+music

yay!+P+the most amazing EP you will ever come across.  so much emotion flows through this album, tears come from my cd player every time in amazement.  do yourself a favor and buy this album, you will never ever regret it. +music
Great, but a step back+P+This is a solid rock album. But it's not as good as their previous effort &quot;Spiritual Machines&quot;. The sound has more bottom to it (thanks to Bob Rock -- or no thanks?) but at the same time it isn't heavier, which is strange. At first I was very disappointed with the album (I have all their previous recordings), but it eventually grew on me. However, if this is a new direction for the band, I don't know if I like where it's going+music
HAHA!  A modern minstrel show indeed...+N+Wow so in history class they told me because of its racist themes and such that minstrel shows are long gone but they obviously haven't heard THIS trash.    Sheesh, where do I even begin?  You thought Fiddy was bad?  How about Chingy?  Lil Jon?  Nope, they're not nearly as bad as these wastes of flesh.  These guys are a disgrace to the black race, Aaron McGruder is totally right (creator of the Boondocks) if Martin Luther King Jr. did somehow get resurrected he would definitely scoff at the state of Black America, perhaps it was a tad exaggerated but it still made an excellent point.  Afterall it was Chris rock that said, "There are black people and there's n***ers!"  Then everyone in the audience laughed their *sses off because it's true.  Unfortunately these guys fall in the latter group.  Don't give me that rubbish on how it's just the music, no way folks, this goes far beyond the music itself.  This is a reflection of the sad state our society is in.  Ok people you want to talk about the actual MUSIC?  We shall then, but these cliched annoying 'beats'  lack so much substance that I'm just wasting text space talking about the 'music'.  The lyrics?  They bring new meaning to the word STUPID.  So there you have it, this logic pretty much applies to all their cds and anyone else like them (the aforementioned rap degenerates) they really take the cake for Retards of the Decade when we talk about "I Love the '00s" in 10 years.  By the way check out the Boondocks, it's a great comic-turned-cartoon, it's very fresh and unique+music
A sad triumph of greed over quality+N+BEP was one of my favorite hip-hop acts of the late 90's. Their Debut album "Behind the Front" and even their Sophomore album "Bridging the Gap" continued a musical approach and ideology more akin to Tribe Called Quest, Talib Kweli, De La Soul, and the Roots than the current Gangster Rap trend.  After this however, BEP apparently figured out that they can make more money with intellectually depraved dance tracks than they can with original music. And it's a shame.  Money Business is a perfect example of an album crafted from bottom to top for pop appeal. In 2004 (with Elephunk) BEP left the Artistic music community and joined the commercial music community. It was sad to see them go+music
Bad beyond imagination+N+The mere fact that this album is popular is enough of an argument for letting terrorists bomb this country into oblivion.  The Black Eyed Peas have re-defined what awful music can sound like.  These guys have zero talent and zero class+music
LYKE OMG!!!!+N+I LUV FALL OUT BOY!!!!!!!!!  AWL SONGS GET 10 OUTTA 10!!!!!!  DESERVS ALL 6 STARSS!!!+music
Absolute Magic!+P+I have listened to Kurt Bestor for several years.  His music is soulful, peaceful and absolute magic!  He is by far my favorite &quot;new age&quot; artist.  My favorite track, What child is this...hauntingly beautiful+music
Musically Flawless+P+So how about that? A Mahler second that actually moves! The result is one of the most exciting readings of all time. It's truly legend.  This is one of the two greatest Mahler seconds. Here Mehta, who can often be an oddly questionable interpreter, lightens the music at just the right level, making it brilliantly unique. Instead of allowing the music to sink into itself, like most imitations of Bernstein's classic reccording.  Music has to move, it has to speak, it has to breathe..  Never has Mahler been so logically accessible and tended for. The experience gained from this recording is greatly edifying, if not spiritual.  Technically however, its not perfect: one thing that makes it somewhat lacking. Sometimes the orchestra is not really synchronized. Precision is sometimes sacrificed for Mehta's ingenious creativity. However, to me these sort of flaws just make the piece more homely and natural.  The Vienna is of course fantastic in sound. Brilliant, but deep and always resonant.   This is some masterpiece material. A truly excellent CD+music
Offensive, and hilarious+P+I recently saw this guy live even though I was only familiar with "What If That Guy From Smashing Pumpkins Lost His Car Keys". Unless you are easily offended, go see him live. You won't regret it, he interacts with the audience a lot. I picked up this CD at the merch table after his show. Lynch's combination of acoustic guitar and innocently wicked lyrics will leave you in pain from laughing so hard. I like the fact that this was recorded before a live audience, because it captures the experience of seeing him at a show. That's what led me to buy this instead of "A Little Bit Special". The audience reaction to the songs on "Superhero" adds so much to the album. My personal favorites are:  Dr. Stephen - I love the way you expect him to say a certain word, then he says something completely innocent instead. You have to listen to know what I'm talking about.  Superhero - This song is a good example of the audience interaction at his shows. I like the audience-chosen superheroes, but I probably can't repeat the names here.  What If That Guy From Smashing Pumpkins Lost His Car Keys - Catchy title for a catchy song. Whether you like the Smashing Pumpkins or not (I do), you will find this short song hilarious. It's a really great impression of Billy Corgan.  Mother's Day - Also very short, but such an unexpected ending.  Taxi Driver - Oh man, I almost p*ssed myself the first time I heard this song! It starts out as a folk song until you hear what the taxi driver said. Totally politically incorrect, but so funny! This is my current favorite track.  Best Friends Song - This duet with Mark Teich starts out friendly and quickly becomes a song about how the one friend wants to nail  the other friend's little sister. Another one you have to hear to appreciate.  I also like the bonus track at the end which contains "Lullaby (live)" and "Special Olympics (live)". Lullaby is great, and explains to his daughter "why Mommy left us". This album is a good place to start if you like dark offensive humor+music
Should be much bigger, all over the radio+P+That these songs are not already all over radio proves that radio is bad for music.  Good lyrics, great musicians, sincere, complex rock and roll that rarely sounds overdone.  Buy Air Stereo, then buy Bastards of the Beat, then call your local radio station and get this music out there.  I'm thinking Wild Stallions kind of world changing power here!  +music
Overpriced+N+WOW. 12 dollars for this CD. I must have seen this album in every stores 1 dollar bargain bin, and their wasn't one CD their was usually a big grotesque stack of them sitting thier+music
Best Remixes since Believe+P+When I first heard the Rosabel Vocal mix at a club, I almost fainted. It was the best club remix I have ever heard.  And I was so worried a domestic single would not be released, and to my relief, it was.  Every remix on &quot;A different kind of love song&quot; is awesome.  You will also enjoy the remixes of &quot;The music is no good without you&quot;.     You will not be disappointed with this CD Single if your a cher fan and you love club remixes....!!!+music
Stuck in Japan+N+Awesome album.  I bought it for "Believe" but there is not a bad song on the CD.  Nice suprise of the song "Building Bridges".  I was thinking to myself that sounds like Sheryl Crow, then looked in the liner notes and it was.  Good harmony with her and Vince Gil. +music
Hillbilly What?+N+ok, I bought this cd and it gets 2 stars one each for the songs "Believe" and "I'm Building Bridges". The other songs are horrible. Ronnie is the lead vocalist for a VERY good reason! They were very smart to get Vince Gill(the best!)to do background vocals on Bridge's. Save your money or you too will be adding this one to your yard sale!+music
Golden Ears+N+A Moose from California compared Audra's "Bill" with one done by Jane Monheit. I took his advise and listened to both. Audra sounds like a church choir singer making an attempt at jazz. The Moose from California has a tin ear when it comes to quality and soul.This is a sad recording as far as jazz goes. It should be in the cabaret bin. Absolutely!!+music
sounds of the 90's without the melodies+N+i've got the first several pearl jam album releases through 'no code'.  this band was just getting worse with every album.  eventually, i caught on and stopped wasting my $.  i read all the great reviews of this album and thought the first single was alright.  who the @$#%@ are these dumb reviewers?  are they getting paybacks?  is this politics or music?  live 105.3 barely played any of this album - and i should have taken a clue from that.  they still know how to play, but need some new energy and ideas to make cohesive, appealing songs.  also, maybe they need to be poor again to lift their spirits - obviously being filthy rich isn't helping!  only put 1 song on my mp3 players...= 1 star+music
errr+N+Too Lisa Loeb for me. Sorry. Maybe if someone else wrote her lyrics+music
Jeff Bates Leave the light on+N+I never knew a voice could sound that good but his does and I hope that he keeps up the good work.He has a strong voice and should be heard more often on radio.A friend of mine bought one of his CD at one of his concerts and it was the best I have heard in a long time.Your music sounds like it is coming from your heart.The one song that really stood out alot to me was Mama was alot like Jesus.I think that it should be your next release.It's a very touching ballad and I think people will want to hear more.A new and dedicated fan.Gerarda Watso+music
OUT TO LUNCH+N+Since "Luck Of The Draw" Bonnie Raitt or her record producers have been out to lunch. "Fundamental" sounds like a jam session gone bad. There is  really nothing special on this CD, except for "The Spit Of Love". When are we going to hear a song like "When The Spell Is Broken" again? Bonnie seems to have passed the female blues guitar mantle to Sue Foley and Kris Wiley. Sorry, I'll stick with her old albums+music
Old, but new+P+I enjoyed this album. At first glance it appears that it is your standard post-1990's rock album. But after a good listen, you realize that they have succeeded in forging a rather good and unique album. It's well done and has a good shelf life due to its distinctive sound+music
AWESOME, Not sure why 4 stars when I put 5+P+I found this Band while looking up information on Trixter and found PJ Farley in the band. Listened to RA on their website and bought this CD the same day.  I have not found a band lately that took me away like RA.    I have not heard the first album but it is next on my list, since I got Duality today and have not stopped listening to it!!!  RA ROCKS!!!+music
Eh+N+I bought CD because at the time, I was a huge Utada Hikaru fan. Her voice is shrill most of the time, but one can overlook that. However, after a time, her songs became boring. Her lyrics are boring too, and the average Jpop artist can write them. Ayumi Hamasaki is much, much, much, much better than Utada. If you want the real Jpop Queen, go for Ayu. If you want a shrill-voiced artist that's bland and boring, go for Utada+music
Shhhh. Listen+P+Miles always let the music do the talking, so my advice is just listen to this album. Nevertheless, I will bang on about it a bit, just like the others. This is a CD I put on after I come back from the pub, or club at night when I've had a few drinks or whatever. Somehow it just calls out to me "Luke... Luke... PLAY ME" and I do. It never fails to move me (and sometimes physically). It is a strange, dark brew of textured piano and electric piano riffs and some minimal rythmical work by Williams and Holland, with Miles gliding over it like only he can and John McLaughlin creating great atmosphere with some wonderful guitar work. It is raw, like most Miles Davis stuff, but also very smooth and peaceful - with a kind of dark streak running through the middle. Quite unlike any music you will hear these days, bar perhaps Aphex Twin. When I first got this album I thought it was incredible and powerful and was even quite scared of it for a while - it seemed to possess some kind of quiet voodoo power. There is magic in this music, definitely. But, over the years I have listened to it regularly and it continues to give me warm pleasures. Every listen becomes a rich, rewarding experience. It is a real grower, and calmer than most of Miles' other fusion work. It is a good companion to "A Tribute To Jack Johnson" (Mainly because of the presence of McLaughlin on guitar), although this album is far less aggressive, and more gentle and mysterious. The album will take you on a pleasant little journey down a bubbling creek, in the middle of the night...+music
So incredible underated...+P+People snicker when I mention skee-lo b/c they don't understand what an incredible complete and great album this is.  This is one of the best albums I have ever bought+music
Eurgh....+N+Okay, two of history's most annoying hits are on this disc: Wonderwall and especially the endless, bloated Champagne Supernova. Liam Gallagher cannot sing, and these guys claiming to be better than the Beatles is ridiculous. Screw Oasis, buy Beatles+music
Stick with the original soundtracks+N+Like other uses have pointed out, the music are NOT conducted by John Williams nor performed by the London Symphony Orchestra, and they do NOT sound the same with the music from the movies.  You are still getting a nice collection of music, but for the REAL John Willims music, you gotta buy the original soundtracks.  These products just don't measure up to the authenticity of the glorious works by John Williams+music
Far Under-rated+P+This is one of my favorite Zeppelin Lps.  Musically, it's very strong.  You just have to respect a group of musicians who could have had a nice payday by turning out a clone of Led Zeppelin II, but opted to do something very different.    It's no surprise that critics and some fans didn't like this one, because the band refused to play to type.  But this is really a very strong session and shows the incredible extent of this band's ability to play a lot of different types of music.  There is a lot of acoustic work on this CD but a fair share of electric to please the electric crowd.  I purchased this in Lp format, complete with the cardboard "wheel" that turned inside the gatefold where you could match up pictures with holes in the outer jacket.   Anyone who listens to FM radio knows The Immigrant Song - what a great rocker.  They opened with this when I saw them in March 1969... or was it 1970... on the tour supporting Led Zeppelin II.  Friends has nice "happy" lyric but there's a sinister sounding string backing behind the acoustic guitar and conga drums.  Unusual.  Celebration Day is a typical Zeppelin rocker that has a great,frantic slide guitar introduction.  Since I've Been Loving You is one of the more powerful blues performances  - black or white - that I have ever heard and I've been listening seriously to music for about 37 years.  This track alone is well worth the price of the CD.  Stunning.  Out on the Tiles is another rocker.  Gallows Pole is a fabulous bit of work on a traditional English folk song done with acoustic including banjo and violin. I love Bonham's drumming on this track, it provides a lot of motion and propels the piece beautifully at just the right point in the song.  Tangerine is an acoustic love ballad - single material.  It's a nice little composition.  That's the Way is a sad little acoustic song about not being allowed to play with the boy next door (I think... it also seems to have an ecological message and a recognition that all that lives is born to die) - I love this tune.  Bron Y Aur - more English folk music, a happy jig of sorts about growing old with the woman you love.  Hat's Off To Harper  - contrary to a prior reviewer, this is a great blues piece done with slide on acoustic as an homage to Page's buddy Roy Harper (See Stormcock on AMazon.com)  I love the tremelo effect they put on Plants vocal.  This lyric eventually became Custard Pie on Physical Graffiti.  Page will be appearing with Harper at a show this summer (2006) playing the entire Stormcock release.  It's a bit pricey because it's an import but if you can afford it it's available here on Amazon.com.  Page is a cameo guest on Stormcock.  Knowelegeable folks know that Roy Harper sang Have A Cigar on Pink Floyd's Wish You were here.  This man has trememdous respect from musicians in Britain including McCartney, Kate Bush, Page, Dave Gilmore and others.  He's a living legend in Britain for people "in the know".  All of the tracks are good, Since I've Been Loving You and Gallows Pole are definitely my favorites.  Buy this at once! +music
Great, But Only a Sign of What's to Come+P+One of the early Judas Priest albums, here we find Rob Halford's voice slightly different (something that would be complained about 20 years later with the release of an album with the band Two) and starting to change into the voice we hear on albums like "British Steel" and "Screaming for Vengeance." All of Glenn Tipton's and KK Downing's signature guitar licks are on here. All the songs are good (there's even a Priest classic..."Beyond the Realms of Death") but this album is far from being their best album or even in the same league as albums like "Hellbent for Leather" or "British Steel". But, don't get me wrong. It's good for an earlier release, but other than that...Get one of their later albums first.  1. Exciter-5/5-Good drum intro. The song is catchy for the most part and Rob Halford does some great screetching in this song. 2. White Heat, Red Hot-4/5-This song's OK, but I think the part where Halford says "white heat, red hot." is annoying. 3. Better By You Better than Me-3/5-His voice sounds more like it did on later albums, but this song doesn't seem really inspired. 4. Stained Class-5/5-Great song! The music on this track in particular rocks. 5. Invader-5/5-This song took a while to grow on me, but it's a very cool song. 6. Saints in Hell-5/5-I like the title and the lyrics. The song has some great sounds. 7. Savage-5/5-This song is really great, Halford's screeching can't be topped on this song. 8. Beyond the Realms of Death-5/5-Probably the best song on here. 9. Heroes End-5/5-Lyrics are good (For a hard rock song).  A+music
Bon Jovi meets Nashville!+N+A rewiver In a big music magazine wrote that this record reminded him of Bottle Rockets and The Drive-By Truckers. He must be kiddin`. You can't compare apples with oranges. I rather say It sounds like Bon Jovi were playin somekind of Nashville pop-country, like the Great Divide.  Some compare this to legends like Lynyrd Skynyrd and Allman Bros. They couldnt have been listening to the same record as me!  But If you like Shelby Lynne and Pat Greens newer stuff, lend an ear to these guys. But If you want blood, search the real thing In these bands The Lost Trailers thinks they have something In common with.+music
Cold Salsa+N+Your Love by Laura Branigan is the reason that I bought this CD.  It is the only reason that I've kept it all of these years.  Her immense vocals can knock down walls at one second and caress your heart the next.  One of the, if not the most overlooked vocalists ever.  Spanish Harlem by Ben E. King, of course, is another great song but you don't need to by this soundtrack for it.  The rest of the CD is throw away.  But for the Laura Branigan song alone it's worth the money.  It's the only reason I gave this album two stars!  If Atlantic Records ever releases a box set for her, or remasters her albums with this song on either, this CD will be turned in to a used CD store &quot;Pronto!&quot;+music
Very Disappointing.+N+George Benson is one the greatest guitarist of all time.  I bought this CD with the hope of hearing George Benson play the guitar with the skill and passion that most professional performers could only dream about.  George Benson did come through on two of the three purely instrumental tracks, "Softly, As In a Mountain Sunrise" and "Arizona Sunrise."  These are the only two tracks produce by Paul Brown.  The other instrumental, "Take You Out" is a tribute to Luther Vandross and is on the "Forever, For Always, For Luther" CD.  George Benson does showcase some of his talent, but he kept the song true to Luthers' rendition "Take You Out."  The bottom line is: if you think George Benson is a great vocalist, you will love this CD, and in my opinion, he is just tolerable.  Three instrumental tracks, seven vocal tracks, this CD is not "Irreplaceable." +music
" Wow !  What a CD !!!+P+This is perhaps, Najee's finest CD. It has real, qualitative jazz flavorings. This is what "smooth jazz" is all about. The entire CD is worth the price and then some. This CD is definetly worth five stars+music
A true jewel+P+I could say alot about this but I will only say a little because I don't need to waste time writing how I feel about this CD nor do you need waste time reading what anybody wrote! Get this CD it is to me one the most slept on album in years but don't you sleep on it, cop this joint!!! peace+music
IT WAS EXTREAMLY DIFFICULT TO LISTEN TO THIS CD AS THE MUSIC+N+COMPETED SO MUCH WITH THE SPOKEN WORD.  I wouldn't be able to reccomend this for bed time at all as you have to listen SO hard to hear the words that it becomes very &quot;unrelaxing&quot;.  However if you chose to  listen to this during the day this would probably work for you+music
Awkward, bombastic, shapeless+N+Amazon's editorial review declares that it's pointless to argue the appropriateness of harpsichord music on modern piano. Okay... De gustibus non disputandum. Rather than argue, may I suggest that you listen to the same music as played by Trevor Pinnock on harpsichord. Even more aptly, you might listen to Gould's Goldberg Variations in comparison to Pinnock or Bob van Asperen on harpsichord. And if it turns out that you enjoy both, then you are a lucky listener+music
Disappointed.+N+I was expecting (er, hoping for) something closer to "Hounds of Love," but this was spacey and unspooled. I appreciate change and I appreciate disjointed ethereal songwriting, but this was a bit much for me. Some songs seem to just spin off into nothingness, others drag on and on. A few songs have much triter lyrics than I expected from her, and on most her voice seems to be rambling while disregarding the music behind it. I liked one or two tracks, but overall I cannot get into this+music
A man of many colors+P+Jack White has done it again!  This is my second White Stripes CD (first being Elephant) and it does not disappoint.  Jack White still has that raw sound with shredding guitar and screeching vocals.  This album seems more mature in a way but at the same time, you know it's the White Stripes from the opening riff and when Jack's vocals come in.  Red Rain, White Moon, and Blue Orchid shows that Jack White loves to put color in the titles as well as in his songs as there are a few different styles.  My favorites, though, are Blue Orchid, My Doorbell, and I'm Lonely (But I Ain't That Lonely Yet).  I think I still like Elephant better but one thing is for certain - the White Stripes aren't fading away anytime soon.  I love his Led Zeppelin/Nirvana style voice and can't wait to hear his new band, The Raconteurs+music
Garbage! Pure Garbage!+N+Garbage! Pure garbage! Sh**! Pure sh**! The only reason she got any type of record deal is because of her looks. She cannot sing whatsoever, and her voice is terrible, and she has no place in the music industry. If you have not noticed, all her hits (only 3 of them) are all collaborations, which says a lot because she can't even sell on her own and stand on her own feet. The only good song on here is "It's all about me" with Sisqo. Seriously, don't waste your time or your money on this talentless slut! Grade: +music
number one female vocalist+P+I saw her in concert and the next night I drove to another state to see her again. Wow, she does sound better than her recordings. Her voice is so sweet it brought tears to my eyes. Genre? I love jazz, folk, blues... Hey, its roots. She's beautifully and purely Lizz. I can't wait till she gets back to the states. You can't hold a moon beam in your hand+music
Whats this song called+N+Whats the song called and who is it sung by when Brian pulls up to the cafe where mia works, its like a little italian/ spanish love song, plz plz tell me i love it an cant find it+music
Best Smooth Jazz CD of 2005!+P+Recently I undertook the challenge of burning a "Best Of 2005" Smoothjazz CD.  The challenge was daunting, being limited to approximately 15 tracks.    Four tracks came from this wonderful CD.  Gregg Karukas, always a skilled keyboardist, has outdone himself with these wonderful tracks.  Track 1, "Girl In The Red Dress" is a fun, upbeat way of beginning this musical adventure.  Track 5, "First Flight Home" is an immensly sexy and driven song.  Track 7, "Corner Club" is a combination of absolutely haunting to so much fun.  And then there's track 8, "Isabella".  In my opinion the best single Smoothjazz track of 2005.  It is the kind of track, when a friend asks "what exactly is smoothjazz?"  Play "Isabella" for them.  They'll understand.  Buy this CD, you'll love playing it for years to come and the artists deserve your support for putting out music at this quality level.+music
I'm hooked+P+As a newcomer to My Chemical Romance, I've been completely blown away by this CD.  That's the good news.  The bad news is that now I have to get all of their previous CDs because they're just too good.  There were quite a few CDs from my favorite bands that I was anticipating this fall, most of which were a total disappointment.  Thanks MCR, for giving us a worthy CD to listen to.  Flashes of Queen, The Killers (Hot Fuss-not the new horrible CD), Jimmy Eat World, even Rocky Horror Picture Show--I could totally envision a broadway show or movie for the theatrical quality of some songs.  Can't recommend it highly enough+music
Country Music Superstar+P+Martina McBride delivers a Traditional Country Music Vocal Performance on her latest CD Martina McBride "Timeless."  Martina McBride covers Lynn Anderson song "(I Never Promised You A) Rose Garden" on her latest CD Martina McBride "Timeless." Martina McBride is a Country music pioneer in her own class+music
I Don't Like It+N+I bought this album thinking that it would be good...boy was I wrong! Ms. McBride did not do these songs justice by the way she sang them. Rose Garden, for example is my favorite song, and is sung by Lynn Anderson...it was the most beautiful song ever and you could almost feel the Rose Garden as Lynn was singing. Marting sang the song like it was a meaningless song...no feeling, emotions, etc. The rest of the songs sounded crummy too. Save your money and buy the orginal artist who sang the songs.+music
Not the music from this movie+N+This is not the music from the movie. This purchase was a Major dissapointment. You would do beter searching for the music credits for titles, then download the tracks form your music subscriber+music
THE BEST SONG EVER+P+Joshs song "To Where You Are" was written for his grama after her death. I just lost my grama and this was the song that was sung at the chaple.  It is a beautiful song that shows the love for a family member, I'm buying the CD, so that my grama will always be close to me      +music
Almost perfection..but bogged down by  a dying style...+P+Judging by their latest release "A Murder of Crows", Incubus have ditched their funk/Nu-Metal/Progressive/Poppish style for a more straight forward rock sound. And for good reason. The moniker genre they were usually placed under has long since died out, and the remaining bands that attempt to release material even remotely close to Nu-Metal usually replicate the Nu-metal bands that came before them. Lets face it, Nu-Metal is dead, and it never really was that great to begin with. Incubus was one of the few great bands that incorporated Hip Hop/Funk/Metal/Jazz and a DJ all in one package. "Morning View" sees the band in their most popular and at the height of their career. Now in the lime light, with millions of fans, "Morningview" does show the band ditching much of their Hip-Hop/Funky roots for more mature production and compostition. The vocals have become the lead instrument with the band taking much of a back seat. That is not to say that "Morninview" is a less-than-stellar album, on the contrary, it is an album worth owning with much to offer. The musicianship is still amazing and the vocals and lyrics are just as deep and meaningful. "Morninview" takes time to break into, and even more time to find the hidden gems beyond just being a "great" radio friendly album. Just like "Make Yourself" I took this album at face value and have missed much of the magic to be found in each song. Under a new light one can easily see that "Morninview" is one of the greatest releases of its time+music
Should have listened to the samples+N+After reading other reviews, I expected something a little more. Other than Gimme Little Sign, the first listen did not impress. Maybe it will grow on me. If not, my Daughter may like it+music
Arrive all over you by Danielle Brisebois+N+After months of searching, I found the out of print cd here.  I had never heard it, but after hearing the fabulous song &quot;My Only&quot; from the &quot;Good as it gets&quot;  movie soundtrack, I had to hear the album.  What a disappointment!  Oh well, it would have been hard to make a cd as good as that song+music
Sanctimonious crap+N+Steve Albini has got to be the most sanctimonious, self-possessed, pompous [person] in the entire music industry. He emerges in one hysterically pretentious band after another. He's hailed as some sort of guru by "alternative" people, when he's actually nothing but an uninformed, homophobic piece of ****. In the song "Jordan, Minnesota" he slanders innocent parents for molesting their children even though the true story is all over the net. Ever heard of research, Steve? Guess not, you've probably been too busy sleeping with prostitutes and pissing on other bands equipment (yeah, I read the tour diary). As for the "music", this is a record by and for people who hate music+music
Awesome CD - MUST BUY+P+This CD is so great.  There is such a good variety of songs on here that you will be happy with listening to it over and over again.  "Save a horse, ride a cowboy" is an upbeat, witty song that will make you want to get up on the table and let loose!  Well worth your money+music
i hate this+N+This album sucks. The song are soooooooo boring. it's just like listening to cold play but even cold play being on drugs, because sometimes people don't do things as well when they're drunk or on drugs. So, if cold play was on drugs they would not play good music and they already suck and levy is like way worse than cold play so what that does that say about their music. It's just so bad. the guitar player needs to take more lessons, maybe from the lead guitar player from new found glory becuase he rocks. ok that's all.  Jason Mitchel+music
Tight album, Bun B puts it down+P+Bun B put together a great album. His flow and lyrics are always on point and he works well with the majority of his guest appearances. If anyone has something bad to say about Bun B or Pimp C or UGK, you don't know real southern rap. The only thing that will become better than this is when Bun B and Pimp C release that new UGK album!  TOP TRACKS:  Get Throwed Draped Up, Drap Up H-Town Remix Who Need A B Trill Recognize Trill I'm Fresh Pushin'+music
save your money+N+This is a terrible album.  Cocorosie is one of those bands that are fun to throw in with a bunch of other bands in a music related conversation to make your taste and knowledge of hip and independent music sound that much bigger than it really is.  The cover artwork is pretty funny and cocorosie is a cool name, the only problem is that they make music that sounds like it does and they charge people money to listen to it. +music
Hairspray  soundtrack omissions+P+Some terrific songs are included, but there are many missing---   especially "The Continental" which was in the movie.  I can't finding the complete song anywhere. Why did they omit it on the CD? +music
Don't Buy This Cd!+N+This cd sucks! Nobody can sing! Andrea McCardle is a horrible annie. Reid Shelton is the worst Daddy Warbucks Ever. Bert Healy sucks too. I Hate This Cd. Please Don't buy this, I'ts Horrible! It's A Humiliation To The Musical Annie! I'm 16, and I Grew Up with Aileen Quinn as Annie. Alicia Morton is The Best Annie. If you want a good Annie Cd, Buy The Television soundtrack to Annie. Everybody on this cd Sucks+music
Overall and insiring and insightful book+P+Wow, what an inspiring book.  It was recommended to me by a South African, whose ethnic background is Caucasian, that to learn about South Africa's recent history and culture, one should read this book.  This book is truly amazing and very, very informative.  The civil rights struggle for equality and equal treatment is vividly depicted.  The decades spent to peacefully open the government policies so that the citizens of the country can equally share the benefits and contribute to the improvement of their society is remarkable.  One important point is that many individuals did not share their government's oppressive policies and many, regardless of ethnic background, supported Mr. Mandela.  His ability to unite a divided country is truly inspiring.  If one wants to learn how difficult it is to live as a second class citizen, with very restrictive policies in a police state, this book is it.  We in the US are very fortunate to have many freedoms and opportunities that we often take for granted.  After reading this book, I am very thankful that we are a united country where we promote based on a person's ability to perform, not their ethnic or religious background.   Reading Colin Powell's autobiography "My American Journey" one also gets a good view on how we in the US can achieve based on our own accomplishments once given a open, honest, and fair opportunity to perform our job.+music
Give Up.+N+Those Franchise Boys (name edited for proper grammar reasons) are just another reason why rap is basically nothing more but flogging a dead horse nowadays. This is simply nothing but mindless drivel. It's basically a scam for more cash, like the majority of rap nowadays. This has no value, no meaning, nothing. Just a bunch of n*gg*rs rapping about the most ridiculous stuff to date.   Buy anything except for this+music
Build and Destroy+N+Shevonne the imperial hoodrat or whatever you claim to be.....you wouldn't know about being a hustler if Ice-T slapped you with your tampon. Its painfully obvious that you don't have any music knowledge due to the fact you enjoy ignorant, inbred, klown music. I am sure you do relate to the lyrics because you definitely have the iq of a tree frog. And no I will never reach that level.......or should I say sink to that level because I never move backwards with my intellect only forward.   Dem Wack boyz are one of th worst groups out there to date.  Support real emcees like Mos Def, KRS-One, and Immortal Technique+music
the way this song was supposed to sound+P+I'm astounded at the number of people that think that an upbeat lovesong like this is supposed to be sung with a voice that conveys angst.  Gritty is putting it mildly, the album version of this song sounds like Chad Kroeger has bronchitis.. curiously enough it sounds very similar to an audio file that's been run through a heavy sound compression codec, which is to say distorted and overall harsh.  I'm certain that this is the version that Santana would have wanted on the album, but Alex Band of the Calling just isn't as big a name as Chad Kroeger of Nickleback, they needed big names to sell it.  So they recorded this altogether better version to play on the radio and in the video to make people think that's what they were getting on the full CD, then pulled a fast one and delivered the bronchitis special edition instead.  On the other hand as the other reviews have suggested, if you liked the album version, if you honestly believe that a love song is supposed to be sung with angst.. and.. er.. grit..  then the CD single is probably not for you+music
My cd is so worn out!!!+P+This cd is by far my most FAVORITE Kenny Chesney CD of all time! I love each and every song on it. Even the bonus tracks are fantastic! A must have for the country music fan!!!!+music
Phenominal!+P+Madman Across The Water.  Wow! This is an essential Elton John album.    By now, most are familiar with the opening track, Tiny Dancer.  Beautiful piano and a melodic falseto set the tone for this, my favorite Elton John tune (and I have many!).  Levon and the title track are also two huge standouts of this album.  This is less a collection of singles with filler as E.J. has been accused of creating later in his career.  Taken as a whole, this album is simply a masterpiece.   Madman was created before the flashy Goodbye Yellow Brick Road days, with all the pomp and ceremony that came along with it.  Here's you get the feeling of a new artist, hungry and clawing to get to the top of the pack.  He's succeeded with this effort and hasn't looked back since.  If you're a partial E.J. fan and are looking for some of his slightly more obscure work, Madman Across The Water would be a perfect and thoroughly enjoyable choice+music
Almost Perfect+P+If you love Mozart you will really enjoy this CD. In my opinion Sir Neville Marriner & the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields  performs Mozart better than any other. The only problem I have with this CD is some tracks on the first CD are recorded live. I have never been a big fan of live recordings. An occasional cough is heard on track 4 which makes me cringe. If only they passed out cough drops that evening I would have awarded this CD five stars. Otherwise the music is simply sublime. Robitussin anyone+music
mmmmm....+N+The reason I can never fully like this album is because of what it created in it's wake, the "float on" kids. I've been listening to modest mouse since when they began and I am disappointed going to a show and having a thousand kids scream at the top of their lungs for that song. If you listen to any of their other stuff, you will realize that it sounds nothing like original modest and they have made their first "mass produced" superhit. The album has it's moments with "blame it on the tetons" and "the world at large" but "dance hall" and "satin in a coffin" bring it down. If you enjoyed listening to modest mouse before this cd came out, don't buy it. You will be disappointed+music
Misleading+P+Ciara does not have a pretty voice. Her single "Goodies" mislead everyone to think the CD was bumping, but that show in the hell was not true. This album has about 10 or 11 songs that are actually good. The following songs include... Goodies, Hotline, Oh , Lookin' At U, Ooh Baby, Next To You, And I, Other Chicks and The Title.I gave this album 4 stars and it show in the hell don't deserve it. Can I Get A Witness!Has anyone besides me notice that Ciara can't dance and sing. Everytime she perform this hoochie can't hardly breath. i guess they call that ASTHMA! Ciara do me a favor. Next time you bring out a CD, you need to breath, stretch, shake and let it go.+music
You're Just What I Need+N+Anyone looking for the song "You're Just What I Need" featured in this movie can find the song on the CD "More Than A Lot" by Rufus King.  It's a very hard-to-find CD because the band didn't have a label but I found it on cdbaby.com.  Don't know if it's still for sale there or not but the CD is worth it+music
getting focused+P+Art of Chill 2 is an amazing divergence from traditional relaxation CD's.  Whether I'm looking for background sounds while reading, entering the relaxation zone or focusing on positive feelings, this 2 CD collection has become a favorite of mine.  I'm a musician and have not been a big fan of electronically created drum or melodic sounds, but when I heard this CD I was attracted to all of the tracks immediately.  It's not too often that you can find an artist/CD where everthing on it has an impact on you.  While playing the CD's working in my office I'm able to focus my concentration and satisfy my never ending craving for new and creative sounds.  If I want to relax and calm myself I've been able to do so with the sounds on this CD set.  Jon Hopkins is a clever musician and taps into some captivating rythyms, chord progressions, melodies and lyrics.  I enjoy listening to this CD as it is my number one relaxation technique on plastic.  Very captivating, and you'll definetly chill; don't pass it up.+music
Harping Up The Wrong Tree+N+Anyone who buys this CD thinking it has something to do with harp music is going to be very disappointed. There's nothing of the tranquility and serenity of the harmonious harp here. What you get is rather percussive and at times repetitive pianoplaying, seemingly based on random chords. The sort of stuff you don't want to play for more than ten minutes. Buyer Beware+music
Led Zepplin III+P+Wow! The more I listen to this CD, the more I like it+music
not quite on target +N+ok. i thought from other reviews that i would really like this cd, but I dont really. the delivery seems completely pretentious as another reviewer said. i cant get past that fact. though damn shame is excellent. its the only one that i added to my playlist. in fact i promptly trashed the rest.+music
Disappointment+N+OK, I guess after 30+ years of generally spectacular music diamonds, everyone is entitled to plunk down a lump of coal.  That's just what this CD is..a dull clunky lump of coal.   I've been listening to Bonnie for most of those 30+ years.  I still have Streetlights and Home Plate on vinyl.  For the past many years, I didn't even listen to her new music before purchasing.  I just bought em!  There were always bound to be a couple "popular" hits and more than a couple undiscovered diamonds on in the tracks.  Not so for this CD.  I Will Not be Broken is acceptable...the rest of the tracks sound almost off key and in some places, even out of tune with herself.   Bonnie is still one of my all time favorite singers - but I wish I would have saved my $$ and not blindly purchased this one.+music
Don't be so harsh on Ann+P+I understand that many of you who have bought this CD will be Broadway lovers (and I am one myself)and you will be used to the lead roles having amazing powerful voices. But just as important as good singing is good acting. I think that Ann interpreted Roxie as a wannabe who had the enthusiasm but lacked the talent, which makes her raspy tones and sing-speak completely plausible. It also supports the theme that you can use other things than talent to get yourself to the top This may not be the way you like Roxie played, but you shouldn't shun Ann's interpretation. It's a good thing if there is more than one way of having a character played, I think so anyway. Personally I love the Miramax film, but I enjoy comparing these 2 and seeing the differences+music
It takes a few listens to fully appreciate, but it's worth it!+P+Being a fan of The Divine Comedy since they released Casanova in 1996, I was really looking forward to their latest album. Much like a lot of previous releases by The DC, this album takes a few listens to fully appreciate it. When I first listened to it, I was disappointed with most of the early tracks and didn't listen beyond track 7. However, repeated listens have definitely added a great deal to my enjoyment of this collection. Track-by-track:  1. To Die A Virgin - Amusing lyrics, but the melody doesn't do anything for me. Opinion seems to be very divided on most of the tracks here, this being no exception. It sounds a bit flat to me.  2. Mother Dear - An unusual country track with a catchy melody, but a far too repetitive chorus. Musically it's great, but the constant repetition of "Mother Dear" quickly becomes tiresome.  3. Diva Lady - Not bad, but hardly the strongest of melodies penned by Neil Hannon. Annoyingly it sticks in your head - I'd rather it didn't!  4. A Lady Of A Certain Age - Beautiful melodies, wonderful instrumentation, and moving lyrics. I've always liked Hannon's voice, but this is the kind of track his singing is best suited to. Stunning.  5. The Light Of Day - A bright, upbeat melody, again with some beautiful instrumentation - strings and harpsichord really add to the classical rock style that the DC have always done so well.  6. Threesome - A charming 1 minute piano instrumental that provides a good break in the middle of the album.  7. Party Fears Two - Elsewhere I've hear people calling The Plough pompous; if any track sounds pompous, it is this one. I haven't heard the original but the strings are overdone for a riff that isn't all that special. The chorus is better than the verse, but this just sounds out of place here.  8. Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World - This one's quite odd. I didn't expect to like it at all but it really grows on you. Great lyrics, a very enjoyable melody and plenty of decoration around the various melodies. Very well composed indeed.  9. The Plough - As I mentioned earlier, I couldn't disagree more with the notion that this track sounds pompous. It's an absolute masterpiece. A wonderful build-up in each verse and throughout the track. A similar feel to The Certainty of Chance or Freedom Road, this is one of the best tracks I have ever heard from the DC.  10. Count Grassi's Passage Over Piedmont - The opening melody links well from The Plough. Great melodies throughout, an unusual mix of spoken/sung lyrics, not dissimilar to The Booklovers - but much easier to hear more than a few times over. Very special, and unique!  11. Snowball In Negative - Yet again, the orchestral arrangements are superb. Interesting contrast between the vocal sections and the piano solos, showing that Threesome wasn't such an anomaly after all. The ending is a little unexpected and slightly drawn out, but this track wraps up the album well.  Apart from the first few tracks, this is possibly the best DC album I've ever heard. It's right up there with Promenade and Fin De Siecle and is a welcome reminder that Hannon is highly unlikely to lose his touch anytime soon. Beautiful+music
Solid "2nd" solo release for JD+P+For his "2nd" solo album (even though this as well as "Life in 1472" have guests on most to all of the songs), JD did a good job.  I'm not a huge fan of his but this album is solid.  Guests are mostly to thank for that, as well as some great production (that he always seems to pull off).  Of the 13 songs on here (it does have a lot of skits/interludes) 1 is a classic, 1 or 2 are near classics, 4 are ok, 1 I skip, and the rest are good. For those who have heard JD before, you know what to expect, songs about women and flashing and flautin his money, nothing new.  Production is also good, JD takes part in 11 of the songs (he produces 1 and co-produces 10) and Swizz Beats & Neptunes each do a song.  I'd recommend this album for his fans or fans of that kind of rap.  #2 - 10 (CLASSIC -- great beat -- f/ Ludacris -- also onone of his albums) #3 - 8 (f/ UGK & Manuel Seal) #5 - 7 (f/ Boo, Gotti, Usher, R.O.C.) #7 - 9.5  (f/ Jadakiss & a good hook from Freeway -- nice beat) #8 - 8.5 (f/ Nate Dogg) #9 - 7 (f/ Bilal) #11 - 9.5 (great beat -- f/ Manish Man) #13 - 8.5 (f/ Nate Dogg, R.O.C., Trey Lorenz, Katrina -- nice beat) #14 - 8 (f/ Clipse -- also on their "Lord Willin" Album) #15 - 9 (f/ Jagged Edge -- great beat and story) #16 - 7.5 (f/ Kurupt, Field Mob, Eddie Cain, Backbone) #18 - 5.5 (f/ Da Brat & Kandi) #20 - 7 (F/ Xscape)  Jermaine Dupri -- b. 9/23/73 -- Atlanta, GA check all my review+music
Hey Dudes!+N+Hey, didn't you have a girlfriend who liked this guy? Remember driving around, another Sat nite of getting nowhere, hearing this guy, "Maggie May", thinking, "didn't they just play that already?" Remember beer-soaked carpets, butts and roaches lying around, stoned and drunk and bored? Remember the stories about this guy getting hauled into an ER at four in the morning in New York or LA or someplace, what they pumped out of his stomach? Is is still around? Does somebody still listen to him? Hey, is this the same guy as Joe Cocker?+music
Whats to say? Splendid+P+I think this is one of the best films I've seen in this life. I always wondered what they did to represent a date in the past as well as they did while I watched the movie. The music was a major groundbreaker in helping creating a totally nerve wrecking feeling of belonging to the past.  This is music for the mind. It seems to speak a language of its own. I didnt know that I liked scores and instruments before I heard the music of "Road to Perdition"   Its so complete in its mesmerising process that it makes me want to salute it. Certainly the best music I've heard for any film. I liked the music to "The Village" too. Passion Of The Christ is another favourite+music
Beautiful, soulful+P+After hearing this cd for the first time, I knew I wanted to buy it.  I also bought this as a gift for a friend and she has been thanking me ever since+music
If your heart beats more than once an hour, DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM!+N+First, I should remind you, Dear Reader, that since italics, boldface type, and underlines can't be used in these kind of reviews, I have to use one capital letter in some mid-sentence words to slightly stress them and use all capitals to stress other words even more!       Anyway, one star on this review is one star too many to give this album and band.       I received this album as a gift for my birthday while I was on the other side of the country.  I'd never even Heard of this band until then, much less any of their songs by pure and simple osmosis.  When I finally got around to taking it out of the wrapping and putting it into the CD player of my car on the way to work and back, I was not impressed with the opening song, nor the second, nor the third, etcetera, and so on, and so forth ...       I kept wondering if this coma-inducing drone (interrupted only by the screaming of the word "Nothing" at least 20 times at the end of the first song) was some kind of tactical build-up by the band so they could eventually break out a song that made them at least Somewhat Big (much less a hit) to start the party.        You know the kind of song I mean, don't you, Dear Reader?  I mean the kind of song that makes you think "Whoa!  Who's THIS?!" because it has a either a great opening, or a great first line or four, or at least Something to grab your attention within the first minute, like Ani DiFranco's song "Out of Range" would do in less than 16 seconds.       Anyway, MANY extremely torturous minutes later, the 9th song came along (ironically for me, it's called "Wishful Thinking") and I honestly couldn't take anymore of this DRIVEL!  I gave this band A Whole NINE TRIES to make something that at least Resembles an impression and all I got was only Slightly less musical boredom as when I did when I once tried to listen to the only bad album I currently know by Tangerine Dream: "ZEIT".  That album, by the way, was basically four 20-minute bits of what seemed like people in an orchestra tuning up their instruments and eventually matching one single note with each other BEFORE the conductor starts a symphony you never get to hear.      As I said, this album is only a micrometer less boring.       I honestly cannot understand how anyone who scouts for the music industry could have happened along this sorry excuse for a band and thought to themselves "WOW!  These guys are On FIRE!  I must get them to the studio and P.R. them IMMEDIATELY!!"       Let me put it this way, Dear Reader: Remember that song "Next Time I Fall In Love" by Peter Cetera and Amy Grant back in the mid to late 1980's?  In comparison to the so-called songs on this album, that cutesy ballad will sound more intense and energetic than "Paranoid" by Black Sabbath.      Maybe Wilco got their record contract by winning a contest of who could bore an audience the quickest.       Oh, and if you're wondering to yourself, "Oh yeah? Well,  let's see this guy (as in ME) make a Better album!"        I already Have made a better album and I'll gladly show it to you.  Leave me a response to this review if you want that proof.  AAAaaannnnnd ... CUT! That's a wrap+music
Sentimental, right-wing claptrap+N+Darryl Worley's "Have You Forgotten" begs another, more relevant question -- "Do You Read the Paper." Despite the fact that Hussein's Iraq had nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks, he justifies our illegal invasion and occupation of that sovereign nation with references to the Twin Towers. To xenophobes like Worley, the Middle East is just one big nation of indistinguishable brown people. He justifies our warmaking with cliched references to "our freedom," apparently oblivious to the irony that the Patriot Act -- passed in reaction to 9/11 -- has effectively cancelled the Bill of Rights. He accepts the Official Version of 9/11, despite the fact that the story has holes big enough to fly an airplane through. I've heard some pretty reactionary stuff on country radio before, but this song definitely takes the cake.+music
5 stars for the album 0 for Dual Discs+N+Come on.  I cannot play these dual discs in my car nor any regular CD players. J&MC are excellent though+music
New Edition minus Bobby,Ralph and Johnny+P+Technically,this is New Edition minus Bobby Brown,Ralph Tresvant and Johnny Gill. Brown,by 1990 when this album was released,was enjoying a successful solo career,especially from many sales of his second 1988 release DON'T BE CRUEL. Tresvant released his self-titled debut also. So the remaining three NE members Ricky Bell,Michael Bivins and Ronnie DeVoe became Bell Biv Devoe. You can see on the album cover that one member has the official NE logo on his sweatshirt. These guys started their musical careers as typical R&B artists in 1983(Jackson 5 clones,vocally). And now they're "hippin' and hoppin'"! NE released their debut CANDY GIRL in '83,the self-titled album followed the following year,and between then and 1988,released three more albums.+music
NOT WHAT I  EXPECTED+N+I was thinking along the lines of the daughter father duo of Nat King Cole and  daughter. This was some what not up to what I was looking for. Skip it+music
identical...+N+poor album. the song 'rocks' is almost identical with any songs of Black Crowers, and even they look alike.and i can't believe is Primal Scream i'm hearing. Primal Scream really has something better to do+music
Lay Back+P+Jon B. returns with his sophomore efforts with a more relaxing feel with Cool Relax.  11 of the fifteen were either written or co-wrote by Jon and seven of the fifteen were produced by Jon B. himself.  With hands on experience, this release becomes more personal and touching for its listeners.  For the most part, "Bad Girl" has the fastest tempo and blended well with the direction of the LP.  Hearing Jon reach for the higher notes on "Can't Help It" was a good display of talent and range as it is altered throughout the song for an appealing tone was quite impressive.  The title track was more or less a jazz tune with an upbeat drum track.  2Pac was featured with equal time on "Are You Still Down" as he almost stole the show until near the end where Jon B. flexed his abilities.  "I Do (Whatcha Say Boo)" is a song about being in a relationship for some time until he finally pops the question of being married.  He then admits how his woman makes him want to stay home instead of hanging with the boys on "I Ain't Going Out".  The inviting "Can We Get Down" is seductive as the question itself as he questions his desires to be with someone sexually.  Hearing Jon croon in another language on "Tu Amor" sends this album to heights of a climax indeed in tuned with the title.  There's nothing missing here except maybe the company of someone to enjoy this with+music
Beyond the Sound Barrier there are no SONGS!!+N+Where the hell is the melody, the song? Just fragments of invention that rarely gel into a work of art. I think Wayne is playing the role of Miles, but has not controled his men in the same way. -think I'm crazy? Listen and judge. j+music
Make Damn Sure+N+If you happen upon the video for MakeDamnSure and the sound on your television is off, then you would think that the band Taking Back Sunday is ripping one hell of a energetic and explosive tune.  They look like the MC5 in the video, jumping off amps, winging guitars around there head, looking serious as all hell.  But if your like me and you turn the sound back on, your going to hear that it's another whiny and droning effort from the emo machine designed to make kids in high school feel self important.    I was asked to listen to this by one of my friends.  I gave it an honest to god listen, but I couldn't handle it for too long.  Being earnest is fine, but stop with this emo stuff.  You'd think after the fiftieth clone of the same band that eventually the comsumers of this stuff would realize that it's all the same. If you like emo, please, buy 13 Songs by Fugazi.  They practically invented the genre, but I actually buy what they do.  I don't buy this crap, this is just the same drivel that i've been hearing for ever.  Avoid at all costs. +music
Hypnotic and fantastic+P+VH1's We are the 80's introduced me to this wonderful album. The video for "Running up that it hill" captured my total attention. I was very delighted to find that the extended version of this song is also included as an extra track. The rest of the CD has multiple and diversified musical surprises. Overall and keeping in mind that this is a recording from the late 80's it is worth the price.+music
I Can't Take It!+N+I got these CDs based on some reviews, but I can not take the singing.  There are far too many little kids singing, and the adults are no better.  It is WAY too gimmicky.  If you want just traditional songs sung nicely, this is not the set for you!  I am going to copy the songs I like and make my own CD - I think there are maybe 2 songs per CD I'll use!  BAD+music
It's Time For JayZ to find some new rapping talent...+N+Well, the Young Gunz basically suck.  Their lyrics are very weak and wack and the choruses they come with are extremely lame.  They also have very generic voices and flows which make for a boring listen.  The production as a whole is decent at best.  However, this album is 100 times better than the atrocity that is Memphis Bleek - 534.  But it's still not good. JayZ needs to clean the rap house and get rid of these 'guys' that call themselves rappers.  He should keep Kayne, Sigel, and Freeway and then cut the deck and start recruiting.  Young Gunz & Memphis Weak just don't have what it takes to carry simple songs let alone the entire Roc for years to come.  Please JayZ for the sake of the Roc's good name...get rid of these tag along bums bringing it down.  1 star+music
Bone knows no surrender+P+this album was everywhere around the time i was entering my senior year of high school,and for good reasons too.this album is so raw,hard edged,chilling and gritty.it has a verry dark sense of urgency,and ghetto desperation.  it even has undertones of the occult like the mr quija song.also songs like no surrender(wich has a sick chorus!)deal with the frustration that inner city youth has with law inforcement(wich seems like another gang in some ghettos).and the song is layered with hardcore rebelious lyrics.especially from wish bone of all people when he talks about the cops arresting him and he says   "Puttin' me on my knees, tellin' me move and I'm dead, 'cause I'm killin' all your b*tches, turnin' them blue suits red. And then I'm comin' to that funeral to shoot that b*tch up, because I know that's where y'all b*tches is bound to meet up. Cop killas, all up in they chest, and I know what to do with that vest, man Twenty-two shots.  I killa. You don't wanna f**k with Bone, nigga. And it really ain't sh*t to pull a trigger on a copper, 'cause if I go down, some of y'all goin' down,  'cause I'm goin' down poppin, so motherf**k all coppers, Let me catch you slippin', nigga, bet I pop ya"  and the title track creepin on ah come up gives off the vibe of young inner city desperation.especialy in the first verse verse by krayzie bone when he says  "Woke up this morning with the thoughts of Robbin' a bank to get rich, ain't ate in days so it ain't no thang to click click b***h, gimme yo s**t."   also lazie bone's verse echos the same sentiment   "See, I'm sittin' in my room, and a nigga feelin' down, steady thinkin' 'bout how to get paid. Gotta gauge at my waist that be  spellin' out murder that'll get a nigga locked the cage. Lay my head to bed, start to thinkin' hard, money is the cause. What can  I do me for? Need to hit a lick, not a bullsh*t, but a real lick, like robbin' a jewelery store."  those verses pretty much sums up this album,so do the verse where bizzy bone said he took his conscience and fried them (with weed) after he robbed someone.  but lets not forget the hit singles like thugish rugish bone wich is bone's signiture song along with tha cross roads.and who can forget for the love of money song wich has great verses from flesh-n-bone(whom is arguably the most overlooked memeber),and the late great eazy-e.  flesh-n-bone- " Gotta get on the grind Pop in the clip of my nine And b*tch if you slip You hit the chalk and fall in the night time Gotta get mine Ain't takin no shorts or no losses Hop on the phone Callin' my nigga sin at home Polishin' that MAC-10 crome Gotta a lick so bring yo sh*t Cause once again it's on To the dome with a fifth of burb we wig to the curb so we swerve And rolled out to pick up the triple six thug And follow the murder for robbin the dopehouse Smoke jump outta me bong So high, now comin' to slay with four grenades and a gauge I'm a play, watch all 'em fall in the grave and lay Pullin' in the driveway, Wish spotted the place and quickly rolled up Bulldozed through the living room Hopped out of the car and started to blow up Buck, Buck, and a kaboom Me blew all them bodies all over the room Them doomed"   bad ass verse from flesh lol,eazy-e comes hard too with this verse  "Standin' on the corner straight slangin' rocks Aw sh*t! Here comes the muthaf**kin' cops! So I dash, I ducks, and I hides behind a tree Makin' sure the muthaf**kas don't see me Now my fat sack of rocks hell yeah i stuffed 'em  Police on my draws, i had to pause And yeah, it's still muthaf**k 'em Now my game is tight, tight as f**k is my game Easy muthaf**kin E or Eric Wright it's all the same  Now niggas might trip on how I stash my grip I gotta have it b*tch For the love of this sh*t MUTHAF**KA!!"  what a great verse from eazy-e,and its one of my favorites by him.  i also love the bass heavy down for my thang and i like how the song fades out with bone harmonizing the chorus as the song fades out.the intro with the quintet harmonizing along with down for my thang made me understand the relevence of the term HARMONY in the groups name.and after hearing the aformentioned 2 songs i kinda got the style and the jist of the group.  and in turn i couldn't wait for their follow up.because their sound was so melodic/smooth yet hard edged and hard as nails.it was unlike anything i heard before.i will admit though i too wonder how good this album would have been if it was a full LP instead of a EP.but "as is" its a great rap album that gives you only a taste of whats to come from this underrated but legendary group+music
DA REAL KINGS OF CRUNK HAVE DONE IT AGAIN+P+YA SHOULD GET DIS CUZ ITS GOTS DA BEST SUPER PRODUCES PAUL & JUICY, DIS CD IS NOW A CLASSIC AND 1 OF DA BEST CDS THEY EVER MADE,YA KEEP LOOKIN OUT FOR FOR MORE FIRE CD'S DAT ARE GOIN 2 COME OUT LATER DIS YEAR LIKE- PROJECT PAT CROOK BY DA BOOK DA FEDS STORY, BOOGEY MANE OUT OF DA CLOSET, LIL WYTE 3RD TIMES THE CHARM,AND YA KEEP LOOKIN OUT FOR THREE 6 MAFIA PRODUCTION FOR OTHER ARTISTS LIKE CHINGY, NELLY, ALI & GIPP, LYFE JENNINGS, GLC, 8BALL & MJG AND THERE  ALSO PROLLY GOIN 2 WORK WITH JAY-Z IN HES NEW CD, ITS REALLY GOIN DOWN THREE 6 MAFIA ARE ON TOP OF DA GAME! DEFEAT DOES NOT EXIT IN DIS CAMP+music
A young Sheryl Crow?+N+I bought this album because I liked her version of Underdog Victorious on Mountain Stage in Winter 2005.  I was disappointed with the version of Underdog Victorious on this album.  Her singing on the Mountain Stage show seemed more energetic and heartfelt whereas this album version seemed flat in comparison.  The album in general just sounds like a really young Sheryl Crow+music
Great CD, Beats A Little Worse Than Usual+P+This is a great CD. It is not quite as good as Quality, but it is a mix CD so you can't expect it to be. The raps and rhymes are great. I think Ms. Hill is one of Kweli's finest songs. The only problem is the beats are a little sub par for Kweli, but still a very good album anyways+music
How Strange Inncocence- EXPLOSIONS IN THE SKY+P+Wow I just don't know where to start with this album.Well, about the album itself: I think this is best explained by the band, so here's what they think- "How Strange, Innocence" was our first attempt at an album. We recorded it in January 2000 in Austin: recording took two days, mixing one day, mastering one day. Altogether we pressed 300 CD-R copies of this album...We had been a band about seven months when we recorded these songs. A lot of feelings (excitement/confusion/glimpses of visions/waking dreams/inability to play instruments) went into this record, but we didn't quite know what to do with those feelings, none of us had even really been in a studio before, and it shows in the recording, the songs show it, too--it's a young record. There are no tricks in it. There's a lightness in a few of the songs that we probably won't reach again. It sounds strange to say that instrumental songs are about something, but to us these songs were/are about such things as a couple walking through the park on a winter day, a child playing on 70's shag carpet, the story of a boy hero leading a revolution against the tyranny of the coal mines. We've had a bit of a love/embarrassment relationship with the record. At certain points along the way several of us wanted to buy back all the copies and burn them. Listening now to this album, it almost seems like a different band composed of four different people. We finally feel okay in re-releasing it, probably because we've now made a couple of records that are recorded better and that are closer to our visions for them. Anyway, we truly appreciate anyone who is interested and listening. Thank you."  That was on the CD itself- hope you found that helpful. I like this CD for two reasons. 1.The wonderful way Explosions in the Sky can tell a story through their instruments. 2.This album has a distinct sound- one all its own. If you didn't like Explosions in the sky before, you will once you listen to this album. -Sherman. +music
YOU'RE BUYING THE WRONG CD!+N+Yes, this is the great PBBB's 3rd album, but it's not the CD you should be buying.  This domestic CD was released in 1989 and has never been remastered.    The import 2CD version of this title (backed with the PBBB's 4th "In My Own Dream") is the one to get.  It was remastered in 2004.  Ditto for "The Paul Butterfield Blues Band" & "East West"; the 2004 import 2CD is also remastered (and sounds incredible) and the domestic CD's are not.  Why WEA and Elektra have not made these four remasters available domestically is a mystery.  Don't waste your money on these inferior versions: Get the imports+music
mr.bubblerapper himself+N+all this dude does is release bubble gum garbage songs like whatyou know about that etc. well mr ti what you know about rap. cause ya sure dont get any lyrical skills i hope you dont think you are going to make people think you are king of the south with garbage like this+music
One hit album+N+I bought this album due to the song "Soak up the sun".  I was dissappointed when it was the only good song on the cd.  I still believe Sheryle Crow keeps it real(Just not on this album)+music
Jimmy: Please Stick with the Postal Service!+N+As a big fan of the Postal Service (their "Give Up" easily makes the cut on my top 10 albums), I had high expectations for this Dntel record, as Jimmy Tamberello is one half of the Postal Service. BIG mistake. Listen to the samples: if you like what you hear, then buy it; if you don't like what you hear, don't make my mistake of thinking that the songs get better beyond the 30 seconds given. Worthwhile songs on this CD: 1)"(This Is) The Dream of Evan and Chan" (The Postal Service remix is available on iTunes, and is a better version than what's on the CD), sung by Ben Gibbard of Death Cab and Postal Service. 2)"Last Songs" is if anything, relaxing. I recommend getting these two songs on iTunes and leaving it at that, save some money.  The CD's too expensive for two decent songs.  Jimmy Tamberello has another digital project that he works called Figurine and (more recently) James Figurine, it's essentially a catchier, poppier version of Dntel, more in line with Postal Service+music
This Ain't No Bull$#@t+P+Excellent work from a local band from my own hometown.  Very unique stuff to say the least - I know of nothing that compares.  Though you should check this out if you dig Hank III's new album, or vice-versa.  Dark Country at its best+music
as good as it ever was+P+this album stands as stong as it ever did the original joe jackson band was far more tallented than they ever got credit for.but here it is One More Time,Is She Really Going Out With Him and the great Sunday Papers .yes they maybe a little dated but these were great times.you can hear it in the music+music
Snake Farm-tastic+P+I thought "Delirium Tremolos" was the ultimate display of Ray Wylie Hubbard's style & talent, then I listened to "Snake Farm". Wow! I didn't think RWH's essence could be distilled down any further after "DT", but with "Snake Farm" I was hooked from the first riff & didn't come up for air until the cd changer kicked in at the end. This stuff is 100 proof Hubbard. Honey, it's all good, down to the last drop+music
Soul stirring+P+My mother gave me this CD over a year ago and I couldn't find any feedback about the album. The album wasn't in the stores either. Whomever compiled the songs did an excellent job and it touched me like his 1st album did. I played it so much that the CD player scratched it. Fortunately, Soulife is out now and I can purchase it to support Anthony. Anybody that loves his 1st will love this one and Ain't Nobody Worryin' as well. He is a must see in concert+music
GREAT COMPANION TO THE "AIN'T I'M A DOG"  CD+N+I GOT THE ABOVE TITLE FROM ANOTHER VENDER AND THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO SEND THIS ONE AND THIS IS ABSOLUTLY THE BEST ROCKABILLY ON RECORD/CD.  COLUMBIA RECORDS WAS NOT KNOWN FOR THEIR ROCK AND ROLL IN THE 50'S AND IF THIS IS NOT ROCK AND ROLL I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS.  GET THIS CD AND THE COMPANION "AIN'T I'M A DOG". YOU'LL BE GLAD YOU DID+music
he needs to get back with paul brown+N+not what I was expecting from him. Everyone out there knows Boney is a fantastic saxophonist. However, this album left much to be desired. I wonder why he left Paul Brown, his former producer. He released some excellent albums with Paul brown. I don't think he's doing well enough on his own. I did not find any track particularly mind-blowing. If anyone that really knows boney doubts this, perhaps you ought to listen to "seduction" and "sweet thing" before making any comments. This latest album is nothing compared to those two. woork harder boney. I would not advise anyone new to Jazz to buy this album.+music
not a fan, but at least they changed the name and i can respect that+N+if you knew me, you would probably know that i love punk music....old epitaph bands tickle my fancies greatly..they days when epitaph was THE punk label..you know, the label with all the re-mastered classics, plus phenomenal newer acts   anyways, until recently, this whole new emo/screamo thing was getting on my nerves...mainly for the reason that it was being labeled as "Punk." yes, this compilation still contains bad religion and pennywise..which is great..i mean i would never buy this for just 2 decent songs and i still pretty much hate new emo, but i can respect epitaph records now that they ditched "punk o rama" since they contain very little punk.   epitaph has a great extension in Hellcat Records to appease the punks/skins...i would surely recommend that someone pick up the "give em the boot" compilations if they want punk rock.  now, the only thing i really despise epitaph for these days is the fact that they have so many classics that are out of print and near impossible to find!   bottom line, if you want punk go to hellcat, if you want new emo and other oddity musicians come to this, the new phase of punk o rama. 2 stars because i dont really care for this, but it earns my respect+music
Rubbish+N+Yo, don't take this the wrong way because I'm not a hater but rather a big biggie fan. But this album is terrible. Its nothing but easy money for greedy producers by using old Biggie verses and whipping up new beats. Biggie certainly didn't leave very much unreleased material unlike Tupac then again I suppose he wasn't expecting he was going to die. But they still shouldn't do s*** like this. If you want to support Biggie's legacy this year which isn't a bad idea, pick up one of the classics - Ready 2 Die or Life After Death.+music

Proof that music ain't dead yet.+P+There are people out there listening to the radio. They want to be rescued. Long since tired of riding dirty on a honkytonk badonkadonk that makes one want to la-la, there are some that would argue that Y2K was really the day the music died. (If not even sooner, but those folks didn't like Nirvana, Alice in Chains or Soundgarden. Go figure.)  Well, anyone who's heard "Gentlemen" or "Congregation" or any other record by the Afghan Whigs should be yelling "Rescue me, Dulli!" And on "Powder Burns," Greg's delivered the goods.  Possibly the most soul-infused yet forward-thinking rock record since the Whigs' "Black Love," the new Twilight Singers record still shouldn't be construed as an Afghan Whigs album without the name. Despite Dulli wearing lead singer shoes, which definitely aids in stamping any project with a signature raspy-throated, tunelessly-endearing sound, the backing band and instrumentation are a far cry from the rabies-inflicted punk animal that was the Whigs. Sure, it's dirty, dirty, grungy blues-rock, but one might be surprised what creeps into a song here and there. "Bonnie Brae" is a melancholy headbanger that could almost be called blue-collar shoegaze. Piano and violin pepper tracks like "There's Been An Accident," while rushing, watery electronic influence is lovingly splashed here and there, most obviously on the intro piece "Toward the Waves"/"I'm Ready."  Of course to think ahead, people usually end up looking back to see how good music was made in the first place. Dulli liked smashing Beatles riffs around on his covers record so much that he's taken to purloining lyrics, too, reframing the timeless refrain of "She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah" with a derisive sneer and a cranky guitar din ("Forty Dollars").  Not every word on "Powder Burns" is an homage, however. Lyrically, Dulli has always struck me as a singing Charles Bukowski. Sometimes it's exactly who you need to hear from to fall asleep at night when you're too bleary-eyed to read+music
Sonny James 20 All Time Greatest Hits+P+Received the CD in a timely fashion. It was just what I wanted+music
Last Chance+N+Johnny, what happened? A very whimpy John Prine, not the "Sam Stone" biting commentary I remember when. I bought this thinking I'd give Prine another chance. Unless he turns around on that road he's starting down, it'll be the last chance I give him+music
High School Musical+N+Don't Buy it. Be warned. It's stupid. You will regret it is the worst possible thing that has come to musicals and hopefully will be the last+music
holy whack!+P+this album good. me like very much.if you no like it, go f*** yourself. if you no like it, you suck more then me english. Actually, my english is not bad at all. This album is great. The beat can be memorized until doomsday and Eminem kicked a**. But Bizzare stunk,except he was pretty good on one track. But Bizzare's crappy voice and flows does not screw up this album. Go buy this album now. When you hear it, you will go crazy over it. If you don't, the Devil is ready to welcome you into hell.+music
Attempt to meaning+N+I was just going to write another on of my moronic reviews, but i couldn't stand anything about the album.    I hate good charlotte, they sound EXACTLY like every other prep-rock band (fall out boy, my chemical romance, simple plan ect.) I could tell simply by comparing the name of the album to the "song" names that this had nothing to do with life or death, and considering their preppy reputation that there would be no hidden meanings withing the songs. After i listened to a couple of these so called "songs" i turned it off, and quickly threw it out of the window.        My point being, with bands such as this, don't expect anything hidden within the title, or the music. It will just be a boring listen the entire way through. If you were looking for an album that DOES have meaning, and is fun to listen too. I suggest eating your own exrement+music
A True Contender For Best Album of the Nineties+P+With Stanley Road Paul Weller has managed to prove to his fans and his critics that he is still an important musician even in his solo days. He hasn't written 12 good songs, instead, he's written one great album. A factor in any great album is the overall feel that perpetuates each song, making them all feel as though they deserve their place and complimenting the songs that come before and after them.  A mostly guitar driven album, Weller fuses good solos and riffs with his usual effective lyrics, often ending a song with a long instrumental that gently ushers in the next song, which gladly and competently carries the album along. However, there is the occasional song that primarily uses the piano evoking another great feel. Though these songs are quite different from the guitar based ones, they seem to come at just the right points in the album so that, not only are they a nice change of direction, but also they effortlessly fit in.  Stand-out songs are 'you do something to me', 'broken stones', 'the changing man', 'I walk on gilded splinters' and of course the title track. To truly appreciate this fine album start at the beginning and just let it play on to the end. It far outweighs the sum of its parts, and as these parts are so good, you're in for a great journey.+music
ANYONE WHO RAPS ABOUT 9/11 IS TRASH+N+I love hip hop and anything that has a beat to it and I liked 'It's goin' down' when I heard it on the radio. However, I just listened to sample tracks on amazon for this cd and came across 'Dope boy magic.' When I heard him rap about 9/11 I was immediately turned off and enraged. How could he rap about something that tragic?! Does he think it boosts his image or will sell him more records?! Hopefully not! This is disgusting! I hope anyone that wants to buy this piece of crap listens to 'Dope boy magic' (and more than likely others too, but I didn't stick around to listen) before purchasing to see for themselves what a SOB this guy is.+music
Some great country music by a great singer/songwriter!+P+When I first heard "The Dollar" on the radio, I was floored.   Not only by the touching lyrics, but also by the traditional sound.   I could tell that the guy singing it had a deep love for traditional country music, and was someone who stayed true to his roots.  After listening to this album, I still say all that.  THE DOLLAR is a great traditional country record.  Sure, there are the contemporary "redneck anthems"--"Rebelicious," "Redneck Side of Me," even to an extent "Keepin' Up With the Jonesin"--but they are still better than a lot of their cousin songs.   Johnson's true country gift, however, comes across in other ways.   The enjoyable "Flying Silver Eagle" is one of the countriest songs I've heard in a long time ("I couldn't put my past behind me, so I put it in a song").   "She's All Lady" is a touching tribute to the woman at home, and "Back to Carolina" is a powerful number.   "My Saving Grace" is an ode to the power of blood over alcohol ("Daddy passed out with his demons, Mama passed the offering plate...Daddy kept the Devil off my back by taking up His time").  The CD ends with the stirring and inspirational gosel number "Lead Me Home."  Jamey Johnsom, from all appearances, seems the direct musical descendent of George Jones, Hank Jr., Merle Haggard, Waylon, and others--he's a traditional-leaning artist with what may come off as attitude, but what is really, in fact, simple honesty.   THE DOLLAR is one of the best country albums I've heard in a long time.  Yes, yes, he's the guy who co-wrote "Honky Tonk Badonkadonk," but for true die-hard country fans, Johnson is more likely to be remembered for the tunes he recorded here...and any more he gets the chance to record in his career.   His voice is undeniably country, his writing skills are formidable, and his taste in traditional country music is unwavering.   God--and the music industry--willing, Jamey Johnson will have a long career ahead of him.  Lord knows, he's the right man to give country music a much-needed injection of traditionalism+music
Not my kind of music+N+After reading such good reviews, I decided to buy the CD.  Only to discover it is not my kind of music.  This is like a kindergarten kind of music. +music
Fantastic+P+When will Elfman get his due credit. The man is one of the most versitile composers of his day, and has not been awarded a thing. Personally I think that Nightmare before Christmas was his best. But Corpse Bride was fantastic. He know how to fit into Burton's visions perfectly+music
murdering the dead horse+N+"A Collection of Short Stories will go down as one of the best debut albums of any band." That, I'm afraid, is a real review...someone actually listened to this and decided that it is so good that it deserves to be ranked among the greatest debuts ever weezer - the blue album led zepplin - self titled  creedence clearwater revival the cure the pixies  queen red hot chili peppers sublime the violent femmes death cab for cutie  houston calls ....one of these bands are not like the others, one of these bands just dont belong.. truth is, I heard this cd before I even listened to it.  This style is hackneyed and killed. It's been so long since a genuinely good band has been seen as cool that even the critics are starting to forget what good music sounds like.  "200 miles that sure is far"...thats a real line on this cd. but whatever, this is what amazing is these days..this is where generations of integrity has brought us in music..its a lost cause because in the end i guess it really is all about the dollar.  The music industry is one of the most unstable industries out there. no one knows how they are going to look financially in the next ten years..so what  do they do? they take the quick cash in..they sign crap like this that no one has to think about. easy music, easy dollar. building a band is too much of a risk these days..now instead of building them and improving them, they produce them..autotuner, cut and paste music...so sure this is a great cd and everyone needs to check it out because we all need to chip in on drive thru/rushmore's new escalade with chrome hydrolics..at least the rap industry is honest about where the money goes+music
watch some of the lyrics if your kids are young+N+My daughter asked for this cd after seeing it advertised on nickelodeon.  While most of it is fine, specifically the Veronica's song talks about spending the night with a guy and giving him the "ride of his life".  Not really what I had in mind for my 9 yr old+music
...And Oceans Flat Out RAWK!+P+The futuristic vibe they get on this album is outstanding. Intelligence is Sexy is a great song, so is Tears Have No Name and Espirit De Corps is outstanding. Every other song is very solid. The vocals have this vibe that no other band creates, the vocals are nearly alien in nature. If you like metal songs that get into a groove and keep it buy this album. They are kind of, in a weird way, an actualized Voivod for the new century+music
it Was a big let down.+N+A friend of mine told me that this was a great cd. Now i do like they might be giants but this is crude compaired to Flood or Lincon. Which were much better     Only about 3 song are any good. Skip this one and get Floo+music
McCain Back with more unbelievable music+P+Screams & Wisphers is another great CD from Edwin McCain and his band. The song Couldnt love you more is a great song for lovers that have ever had doubters about there love, Edwin McCain is in my opinion one of the best singer song writers out, the way he makes you feel the songs and stories with his words is something only true artist can do. Not a big radio artist but that keeps him grounded and not caught up in the HOLLYWOOD sell out that so many of these so called artist give into - A great cd by a great artist and worth twice the price the sticker has on it, nothing Edwin McCain puts out is bad, if your a true fan of REAL music youll love anything Edwin McCain puts ou+music
One Great Song Does Not a Classic Make+N+Other than Heavy Metal Drummer, this album is totally mediocre. This album is perhaps the most overated, overhyped alternative album of all time. I do not see what all the fuss was about. I guess that sums up Wilco for me in general. I could not name another song on this album because none of the other tracks are worth remembering. Download Heavy Metal Drummer off a paysite and skip this album at all costs+music
it's been a great 9 years...+P+I fell in love with the cardigans when I was 10 with "Lovefool."  At the time I liked the mindless bubblegum quality, but now, 9 years later I'm (amazingly) still in love with them, though for different reasons.  They grew with me, I guess, and when I think of the music of my childhood, the cardigans are it for me.  It's crazy that after listening to them for so many years I still enjoy them so much, but their music just doesn't get old.  If you're debating, just try it!  at first the blatant pop my get on your nerves, but I like it because it's.... unapologetically pop.  try Dressy bessy if you like the cardigans +music
David Gilmour's On An Island+N+This CD just goes to prove how great of an influence David was on Pink Floyd's music. Out of the box this album is layed back an colored with many subtle textures, it's mellow ambience transports you to dreamy mindscapes. I found the more I listened to it, the more I liked it+music
shut up+N+Frank Zappa had a title that is apt for this Norman Brown cd; SHUT UP & play your GUITAR !  Pop arrangements, lots of vocals, and drum machine. No Jazz here.    He is an awesome guitar player, and I really like his earlier cd's. Do yourself a favor and skip this cd+music
Not his best work!!!+N+It seems as though the smooth jazz artist are trying to attract the r & b listener.  The cd was done in poor taste and the songs lack creativity as well originality.  Too many vocals.  I would rather here him play his wonderful guitar.  I love Norman Brown but it seems as though he just through this together+music
i phantom-+P+this cd is mad nice....  this is mr lifs first offcial lp..  on this one, its a concept cd that talks all about gov and a person tryna live in the system of society and life in america  its takes a few listens to understand it all, but I mostly enjoyed this one....  its not as consistant as "emergency rations", which i belive is his BEST work cd...thats my only problem with it....   other than that...if yall like backpacker/politcal rap.. frab this one and akrobatik's balance cd=+music
I'm sure if it were sung in english, I'd hate it+P+Japanese singing is cool to listen to. It is an elegant language that sounds really good in combination with the synthesized pop style..(not synth pop mind you, but keyboard drums and all).  I am sure that if it were done in english, I would look at it the same way I look at britney spears...+music
What the .... ?+N+They couldn't let children sing about the "pelvic thrust" and had to change lyrics, so what's the point of doing the Time Warp again! ;D And that AWFUL cover of Ghostbusters makes me hurl! :+music
Falling Star!  Wow, what happened Brad? Bad Album+N+Of course I purchased this without previewing any of the songs because it's "Brad Paisley."  What a mistake!  Really bad song writing! Bad Song Selection for an album! Horrible attempt at humor and I'm wondering if Little Jimmy Dickens will continue to get speech therapy on all of Brad's albums.  I'll be selling my copy of this new CD.....it's junk+music
Donnell Jones new album/Rhymefest's new album+N+I have been waiting on 2 cd's for almost two months. I am yet to receive "Journey of a Gemini", or "Blue Collar Music". If possible, can I be reimbursed, or sent another copy of each cd. Please let me know. Thank you. +music
Amazing Dance Song!+P+To tell you the truth, I can not find words to explain why this song is so amazing. The first time I heard the album version, I was like "Why choosing clocks, phones and ABBA samples for a first single? What is Madonna thinking?" After buying this single and hearing it loud at home, I could not stop dancing (specially the Stuart Price Remix). There is a feeling of "Leting go, forget your problems, feel free", not easy to describe everytime you hear it and dance to it. Even after, you will find yourself saying "Time goes by, so slowly, so slowly, so slowly...+music
Pretty good!! +P+Great remixes. Not her best, but it ranks up there with her best!! :+music
Great CD+P+Should have had promotion and been released a lot earlier in memory of the late rapper, great cd, got that ol' school rap fee+music
What's all the fuss...+N+Not terrible, but I don't get the hype.  To me, it's just New Wave Disco-and Disco was bad in the 70's.  Finally, what's this doing in a "Power Pop" category?  No freaking way is this remotely Power Pop!  What a disgrace to Power Pop lovers+music
Worth the Money+P+As a boy , I hated all country music, because my father hated Rock'n Roll.  But I knew that Hank Williams was something special.  I bought his 40 greatest several years ago, thinking that this was the ultimate collection.  However, for some reason, when this 10 CD collection came out, I bought it.  If anyone thinks Hank Williams was one of the greatest preformers ever based on his hits, YOU NEED TO HEAR THESE CD's.  His versions of songs such as &quot;Cool Water&quot; &quot;The Old Home&quot; &quot;Rocking Chair Money&quot; and many others make his hits seem tame.  These recordings are masterpieces+music
DISSAPOINTMENT+N+this album was pathetic. eminem's first 3 albums were classics. this album, eminem doesn't know what to rap about.+music
5 Stars for Batman+P+What more is there to say about Danny Elfman's Batman score?  It's one of the most popular and well-known scores of all time.  Thousands of people have written their opinions of it.  What more can I say?  I can say how it affected me personally.  It was the first movie score I ever bought, and it was brought to my attention from my dad when we watched the film together as he said "listen to this music in the opening credits Riley".  Since then, my score collection has expanded 400 times, and my life and filmmaking career have thrived because of it.   What can I say, really?  I can't continue to bore you with pointless anecdotes.  I can say that this music is incredible and still in my top 5 of all time.  It's Elfman's best work.  It's heroic, it's dark, it's thematic (I dare you not to whistle the Batman theme when this CD is over), it's operatic, it's over-the-top, it's action packed, it's brilliant from start to finish.  There isn't any wasted space on this album.  Elfman has a job to do, and does it with rarely elsewhere seen success.  He practically created this idea of a "dark superhero theme", and while the movie was a slight dissappointment, this CD continues to thrill people of any generation. What can I say?  This score is a masterpiece.  End of discussion. cheers K+music
Should be Called 'The Remixes' not 'Greatest Hits'+N+I bought this cd many years ago and just now feel the urge to write a review.  I was so disappointed.  I mean the original versions of these songs are good but after listened to half a disc I felt remixed out.  The remixes become boring and just left me thirsty for the original versions.  Also did not like the way the songs were broken out.  One disc is supposed to be mellow and the other is supposed to be jamming but after listening to the disc I wondered why songs appeared on the wrong disc.  There is no flow on these cds.  I am still waiting for the proper greatest hits while this one gathers dust.  Not recommended+music
Better than most German goth+P+I'm pretty new to these guys, figured I'd take some time to dig into German goth since goth is pretty well dead here in the US, by which I mean all the pioneers from the 70's or 80's are either gone, changed tracks, or sold out to that crappy early 90's House Tekno sound.  These guys have a little of that crappy House sound that you would expect from about 99% of the so called German Goth bands now a days (and sadly now Skinny Puppy as well), but it also offers a lot of new an original beats which I can really sink my teeth into, also some of it does kind of tug at the ol' psych a bit, which is a good thing, but it is no where near as amazing as Skinny Puppy was in its glory days...  ...everything pre-process, though the process was still "pretty good" for the most part+music
This is a really good CD+P+I liked the other BRMC albums a lot as well, but I think those had that quality where they were initially catchy and you loved it and thought it was the greatest thing ever, but after a few listens it got kinda tired...  Still good, but you'd think "oh yeah..."  Howl is the opposite.  It was OK the first time I listened to it, and I kinda liked it, but it didnt really dig it's claws into me.  For that reason it didn't get pulled out of the CD wallet all that often.  Then I put it in one day and thought "ya know, this is actually pretty good."   Then I started listening to it some more and thought "man, this is really, really good!"  Guess what?  Now I love it...  This is definitely a creeper CD, as in - it creeps up on you (yeah, that was a stoner analogy.)    I think "weight of the world" is the best song on the CD, but "howl" had really grown on me too - but I don't want to harp on the songs too much, this is an album as a whole.  Bands grow up and change, and I'm glad to see that BRMC has done it, and done it well.  They haven't lost their muse or gotten "softer" just to try something different -- they've grown and changed and their music shows it.  I remember my freshman year in college when Achtung Baby came out and there were people saying stuff like "boycott U2 cuz they're sellouts!" - not realizing that AB would be looked at as probably the most insightful, clever, and musically interesting album of their catalog.  That's what the backlash to Howl reminds me of -- shortsighted and not entirely accurate.    Yeah, people may fear change, and admittedly, some artists try it and look like complete idiots in the process (Chris Gaines, anyone...) but BRMC has actually grown, and if you liked their first 2 CD's I'd say give this one a shot.  It's really good - and I'm proud of 'em for making it.   +music
So Sick Of This...+N+I don't want to hear any more of their music on the radio. It is all just nonsense, and none of it should have ever been made. They are one of the worst hip hop acts in recent memory+music
Sarah Fan?  -  Buy this Now...+P+I wasn't a Sarah fan in 1999 when the "Mirrorball" tour came through my backyard, where "Mirrorball" was recorded live, at Portland Oregon's Rose Garden.  But I had become a fan, and was at her show, when she came through with the "AfterGlow" tour.  By the time "AfterGlow" was out, I had just discovered the original Mirrorball CD and DVD, and up until the release of this 2-CD set, the original "Mirrorball" live CD and DVD were my "most played" CD and DVD of my whole 700+ various artist collection.  But even before finishing the first CD of this 2 CD set, I know that I had to have another copy for the car.  Sarah Fan?  You must buy this now.  I promise you won't be disappointed.  It is the full show, with all of her interactions with the crowd, and the sound is better than either of the previously released Mirrorball CD and DVD titles.  I love live music, and this set is a dream come true.  Sarah is a true performer "live", and I think is actually at her best when performing "live".  Absolutely amazing recording and performance on this newly released 2-CD Full Concert Live set.  And if you get a chance to see her perform, pay whatever it costs to see her show+music
Not The Beatles Thats for Sure+P+If you are looking to add to your beatles collection be forewarned.  This is not your typical Beatles fare.  It is however a good deal better than fair after you get past trying to peg it as a Beatles album.  Its Lennon.  He's pissed off.  He has a lot to say and he says it all on this record.  He sings these songs like he has wanted to sing them forever but was never allowed.  He breaks these songs out like they are part of a therapy session and he doesnt turn back.  This album on 1st listen is a bit of a disappointment to me.  On 2nd listen you know what its all about and you dont listen for pop hits, you listen for the album as you heard it the first time.  The only way most people will enjoy this album is after a few listens especially if your going into it with a preconceived notion.  Also a lot of songs on this album have a rocky start and then pick up steam in the middle.  This album is ultimately very good once you know what your getting into.  Its Lennon breaking the chains from the Beatles and really from himself.  After the 3rd listen, it immediately made sense to me.  Now i cant put it down+music
Patchy at best and nothing to be so proud+N+except for Ray of Light, which is one of the best pop songs of 90s, the Power of Goodbye, Beautiful Stranger and Deeper and Deeper. Where are the remixes of Don't Cry for me Argentina, or You Must Love Me or the remake of American Pie? The half of the album is full of silly ballads and R&B-scented numbers like the rubbish It's Human Nature, the sleep-inducing (but mean to be a good ballad) Take A Bow which is the same with all Babyface songs, Bedtime Story which is the same as ever with anything Bjork has done in the past and so-so Secret. Frozen seems to be a nice standout but it doesn't feel sincere, and more or less sounds like Power of Goodbye... and the Music album was one of the worst albums Madonna crapped out so singles should not be different.  All in all, Madonna is not a slow number singer; her voice terribly sounds weaker than her dance numbers and that's why this greatest hits album was not successful as Immaculate Collection because the singles were already bad. This album reflects the spiral-down of Madonna through 90s to 2000s (except Ray of Light where she struck gold) where she hit the bottom with American Life and has not recovered herself. Go buy Immaculate Collection, Ray of Light album, down load one or two other songs at your disposal and you will have the good things Madonna has produced among the heap of redundant mass called pop music.+music
Original.....HA.....what a joke!+N+NOTE: I bought this CD a while ago, the tunes were mediocre. Then again I'm probably biased because I don't really like rap a whole lot.   Buuuut, what made me throw away this album you ask?  The guy is a racist, who uses this record as a soap box to talk about how evil white people are, and how they're out to screw him over at every turn. Seriously, listen closely, and I counted at least the first 4 to five tracks are sprinkled with racist lyrics. I despise bigots who may have had one or two bad experiences and then turn around and see fit to spit rhymes about how white people are keeping everyone down. I don't care what race you are, don't be hating on races just because you have a selfish, racist streak in you.    In "Jesus Walks" he talks about how we need to defeat racism...well he keeps harking on it. But he won't stop whining. I agree with him, racism does exist and it is a very real problem. However people like him play victim and make millions of dollars off it. I shouldn't have to listen to an album and feel bad about being white, or black, or any other race. Such themes litter the album and take away from its supposed originality.   Additionally, why does he even think that he is worthy to call upon Jesus? The track following "Jesus Walks" he talks about getting falacio (I'm trying to be PC, not that it matters). I'm no prude...most of the music i listen is laden with "foul language". The guy is a hypocrite to an insane degree.   He raps about the same stuff. And its not different then most other rappers out there. He's really not original at all. Over and over and over again: Look at me I'm important, feel sorry for me. Its like the emo of rap, the Linkin Park of rap.    The guy is a megalomaniac, narcissist, self absorbed racist, and I won't be buying anymore of his music.   SUMMARY: Musically its ok, nothing really orignial. Just Ok if you like rap (a genre I'm still trying to get into). The guy is talented I'll give him that.   Lyrically its a joke. He's a fake. If that stuff matters to you. But if it dosn't, then ignore this review....or ignore it because you don't like my opinion. +music
Guys talking over a beat, great!+N+This is a joke right?! I honestly thought this group was a hiphop parody group at first because I figured nobody could be that bad on purpose. These British rappers are hiliarous, they basically talk over a beat and it doesn't even rhyme half the time. I got given this cd for free and I still want some money back+music
Must have ..!+P+The albulm is a Bomb. It's a must have in the library+music
delivering that murda muzik+P+this is their forth album,it came out in 1999 when i was 12,my boy aaron kept playin this album and  i got annoyed and i asked him if i could borrow it and he let me hold it and then i can see why he kept playing it,the beats are addicting,this is when mobb deep started to go a lil commercial not too much but they still kept it real,its not ass dark as hell on earth or the infamous but it shouldn't stop you from listenin to this album,this is a good album but its not the same as thir ealry material,also for mobb deep or qb fans y'all should check out the murda muzik movie,it was supposed to come out back in 1999 but kept gettin pushed back,so it finally came out in 2004.recommmended for fans  of mobb deep,qb hip hop,ny hip hop,late 90's hip hop.standout tracks are streets raised me (reminds me of junior high school days when i used to live in ny),what's your poison (featuring cormega,he murdered this track spittin that fire),adrenaline (nice dark organ sample),quiet storm (brings me mad memories),thug muzik(produced by alchemist featuring the infamous mobb),the realest (produced by alchemist featuring kool g rap,one of the illest collabos),usa aight then, it's mine (i used to play this song a lot),and quiet storm (remix featuring lil kim).also mobb deep y'all should bring it back to murda muzik beats wise or hell on earth on your next album+music
Very disappointing+N+I was extremely disappointed by this album. It just didn't grab me at all like Fallen did. It has no outstanding tracks or anything much memorable. I guess Nightwish has spoiled me. Before, Evanescence was about the only female-fronted band I cared to listen to. Now that I have discovered Nightwish, Evanescence just seems useless. Sorry, but I just don't care for it+music
A Simple Review+P+Buy this CD. The songs are excellent,as per usual. This CD is more rock, with the same enjoyable dispostion... to quote from track 6, Decatur St. "I'm one of them sad boys who's hypnotized by girl's who walk the walk..."or track 5 The Killer.... "I want you to burn me til I feel it..." ... need one say more+music
ELEGANTLY COOL!!!+P+This cd is as cool as they come.  Simply smooth all the way through.  I love every song here.  If you are thinking about getting this cd, stop and go get it.  You'll love it.  Ta ta..+music
That's it?+N+I had heard a lot about My Chemical Romance, both positive and negative. I decided to pick up a used copy of 'Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge' so I could form my own opinion without the biased input of from jaded indie hipster snobs or 14 year-old spoiled scene kids.  This record was written and marketed to deliver pop songs, and the opener 'Helena' is an outstanding one. It has a great melody that stands up to repeated listening, and the performance is passionate and convincing. The problem is that on every other song on the album, I was bored with the melodies and performances, even after extensive repeated listening [I'm talking about keeping this in my CD player for over 2 months, not just a quick skip-through]. The high-gloss production values suffocate any negligable amount of rocking power and sonic depth that the music might have had, and the juvenile melodrama of the lyrics and melodies gets old real fast when they don't deliver the pop hooks they promise.  This album does not rock. Period+music
Repetitive+N+I am quite dissappointed in this CD, being won over by the sound bytes that I sampled here at Amazon, which are very beautiful. Imagine listening to one of the samples presented here 20 times in a row.  The sample represents the whole of the song, which is repeated over and over and over with a solo over the top.  To me, this signifies a lack of creativity.  There is so much potential in each of these songs, but it is as if Avishai wrote 4 measures and then put a repeat sign at the end to finish the song.  Maybe my expectations were too high, expecting a Billy Childs type of song structure.  I will be looking at selling my CD so I can recoup at least a portion of my investment+music
John Fogerty Premonition Is The Best DVD To Own A Dream Come True+N+I have listened to this cd, also watched the dvd, of John Fogerty's long road home on amazon. Nothing can compare to his Dvd of Premonition.I own It love it, Put it on and  makes me  rock out, With one of the best entertainers In his prime time of life.The guitars and Instruments he plays is awesome to watch a legend of great talent.His voice Is so excellent & clear.Had some friends over with John's Premonition dvd playing.It took all of us back to that time In history.They all went to amazon and bought Premonition.I know soon they will all be gone.I went back to buy one more the price is so reasonable.As I consider Premonition to be a Collector's dvd.If you see it again.Do not wait buy it while they are available. I know its a Import as most dvds are today.Mine plays excellent In audio and picture.You feel like you are sitting in the audience with John performing.Give Premonition 10 Stars.Anything after John's Premonition dvd can not compare to it.No matter how hard they try to bring back his music on a Cd or a dvd.Premonition Is the best dvd  of all of times. All the rest get 1 Star for trying. Though not coming close to what I call  my Collector's Edition  dvd of John Fogerty's Prmonition. +music
The best LP she put out since Plantation Lullabies+P+This CD was off the chain! From start to finish. The grooves were tight, the lyrics were full of food for thought, and that voice...that VOICE. It's a melting pot of songs from politics, to sexuality, to love, to self consciencness. She spared no one on every subject she covered. My personal favorites are Dead Nigga BLVD./Priorities/Earth/and God.Fear.Money. I didn't like the remix to Pocketbook, it was just too loud for a style like hers. But other than that, this album to me is the best she ever put out. Buy it, it's worth it+music
Effortless Grace.+P+Most singers have to scream from mountaintops to be heard.  Others have to strategically position themselves to be taken seriously.  But Maysa Leak, vocalist of the underexposed Incognito, has a grace that oozes so effortlessly, that her peers must be scrambling to wonder how she's able to do it.  Her solo debut isn't going to make anyone forget about Incognito, but it's a solid album that shows that she's able to stand on her own.  The disc is a mix of jazz-laced soul that never makes leaps and bounds to make a statement (heads up, Alicia Keyes) and doesn't stray too far from her past work with Incognito. Like a kite on a windy October afternoon, it soars with ease.  Favorte tracks of mine are &quot;Black Heaven,&quot; &quot;Can We Change the World?,&quot; and &quot;Peace of Mind.&quot;  Maybe, one day, the mainstream will catch up with Maysa and find out what it has been missing for all these years+music
awsome early JV, and Germs+P+I met JV, Loki and Germs when they started Gotham Road and 2 yrs ago.  And we have been friends since.  So I wanted to check out their earlier stuff.  I like it, now I gotta check out the rest of their early stuff.  The singer J-sin at times sounds like Iggy!  Check them out!  and if you really want some good stuff then check out Gotham Road - Seasons of the Witch demo+music
Not that good+N+Stick with Blitzkid because they can sing ten times better than this guy. He is also in Blitzkid actually and he plays drums...where he belongs. The songs on this cd are very well written and played, its just a shame that the singing is so forced and cheesy. I mean I know this is supposed to be 50's style doo-wop rock, but please. Better things in the genre....like Blitzkid+music
A Superb Voice+P+Faith Hill's latest CD 'Fireflies' is wonderful, not necessarily because of her choice in songs, but because of her beautiful voice.  I have been a fan of Faith's since the beginning and I must say her music doesn't disappoint.  While the songs are not as strong as say the songs on 'Faith', they are still quite good, particularly the songs written by Lori McKenna.  After hearing Faith sing her songs, I went out and bought Lori's album 'Bittertown', which is quite simply an incredible album.  On 'Fireflies' Faith masters each song and brings such a beautiful interpretation to each song.  Songs that I particularly enjoy are "Stealing Kisses", "I Want You", "Paris" and "Mississippi Girl".  I've read other reviews that said 'Fireflies' left them confused.  The album's songs do lack cohesiveness at times, but overall the album is still a must-have if only because of Faith's voice.  She has, without a doubt, one of the most beautiful and pure voices in music+music
Get Right And Skip This+N+This CD is too wack to have so many songs. J Lo should've just kept it below five. Her voice is thin, tasteless, and watery like powdered milk at the end of the month.+music
This is what happens when you ditch Steve Earle+N+Your music goes back to sucking.   Steve Earle didn't talk much about Car Wheels in his autobiography other than to say working with Lucinda was a real drag. Well, whatever. Obviously it produced incredible results and no matter how difficult she is they should look into working together again. Because frankly, w/o Earle, Lucinda Williams writes fairly boring songs and puts them to even more boring arrangements. And without Lucinda, Steve Earle does fairly generic country that is rarely worth a second listen. Together, they're awe inspiring.  Anyway, on to Essence: boring songs+boring arrangments+drugged-out singing=bad album. Trying to pimp the tracks up with production pixie dust doesn't fix the fundamental problem here: the songs are lame. In place of insight we get shopping lists, in place of hooks we get verse, verse, verse. And in place of emotion we get slurred vocals.   Such ingredients do not make for a good record.   as a side note, if you filter by "most helpful" you get reviewers who aren't 5-star fanboy clones and write intelligent reviews. Most of them were not fooled by this album, no matter how big a fan of Lucinda they are.  RstJ+music
Very dissapointing+N+I was just overall very dissapointed.  I tried to make myself listen to this album but I could only do so a couple times before I gave up.  I thoroughly enjoy hip hop but much prefer Kool Keith or MF Doom or Gang Starr or other slightly less than mainstream artists+music
Aw, come on people ...+N+Although I consider "Too Much Time On My Hands" a guilty pleasure, Styx is to rock music as Pee Wee Herman is to pro wrestling.  Many years ago, I had a guy working for me who had been a roadie for Styx in his younger days. He told the story of the night the entire roadie crew walked off the job -- they just couldn't stand to listen to the "music" anymore. What else is there to say+music
The Best singer you've never heard of.....+P+I first heard Joe Carson back in the early -70's while going through some of my folks' 78's.  At first, I thought it was Webb Pierce (on one of his best days);  then I distinctly heard Hank;  on the other hand, there was the sound of Ray Price (his Cherokee Cowboy Days).  All of these sounds came from a young kid (16 when he started performing) who should have, by every right, been the most heralded Country/Hillbilly/Honky Tonkin' singer ever; and yes, that includes even the great Hank Williams.  But, Joe Carson's life was cut short just as he was hitting his stride.  If there was a way to rate this collection higher than 5 stars, I would not hesitate to do so.  As with all of the Bear Family Records releases, this one is an outstanding collection, beautifully recorded and mixed, and a thorough set of liner notes/booklet.  Not only does this album showcase the stellar voice of Joe, the backing band (all legendary members of the Hank Thompson era) will knock your socks off.  While there are 33 songs here (3X more than most current releases), there are a few real standouts:  "I Gotta Get Drunk", "The Last Song I'll Ever Sing", and "Shoot The Buffalo" all showcase his voice.  And, there are a few old favorites here as well, inlcuding "Fraulein" and "Who'll buy the Wine".  This is one of those albums you have to own;  and I can assure you, you'll be shaking your head in amazement at Joe Carson's talent. A++++music
Canadian GODS+P+Blue Rodeo, out of Canada where they are rightfully GODS, continues to fly under the US radar...what a shame, especially when one stacks Blue Rodeo against lesser talents. "5 Days In July" is the gemstone of this richly talented group. Combining elements of The Eagles, The Byrds, Poco, The Flying Burrito Brothers,twinges of psychedellic memories, 60's style chord work *which comes off VERY nice* and at times, vocal harmonies which bring a sweet hint of The Everly Brothers, this group, which can rock with the best or slow it down to a nice mellow, has a sound of their own. At once, the lyrics are memorable and catchy. The vocalists, Cuddy and Keelor, each bring their own qualities which never grow old with Cuddy having impressive range while Keelor brings at times, a nice raspiness with a clever edge. "Bad Timing", one of the great tunes off this gem, would soar on the country charts if given a chance. With the exception of "Til I Gain Control Again" *brilliantly covered earlier by Crsytal Gayle and later by Willie Nelson*, all the tunes are penned by Cuddy and Keelor, as are their efforts on other Blue Rodeo albums. I had the great pleasure to see/hear this remarkable group at The Ramshead Tavern in Annapolis, Maryland. They DID NOT disappoint. If you're looking for GREAT music outside the usual stuff played endlessly on formatted radio, this is a MUST! I would also suggest their DVD, "Burning Snowmen", which chronicles them over time. If you can, find a way to one of their concerts..+music
In the Morning of Magicians +P+Flaming Lips have suceeded in creating their own musical world on "The Soft Bulletin". This cd is easy to find at most stores and often sold at a low price, so there is no real reason why you can't go pick it up right now. This record is best heard at 3 am with headphones on. Yoshimi was my first lips record, and the main difference between "Soft Bulletin" and "Yoshimi" is the production values. This recording has a big lo-fi sensibility to it. Steven's drums are always loud, boomy, and usually crackling, like they recorded way too hot. At times the record seems overloaded with sounds, and at first, I thought it would have benifited from the more prestine "Yoshimi" production values. It has grown on me though. I don't really understand the point of having "Race for the Prize" and  "Waiting for Superman" (the weakest track on the album) in two seperate versions. To me the record would have ended perfectly on "Sleeping on the Roof".+music
5 star CD+P+Great, Cd I love it, Kelly and Lee Ryan could make a great duet,this is one of my best CD's, It's awsome, I love all the song, great job Kell+music
Way off mark!+N+If you're like me, you got into Boo Radleys during the shoegazer era.  I loved the discs preceding Wake Up!, especially Giant Steps.  This is as far away from shoegazer as you can get.  The first reviewer here is right on as now Carr is totally doing the Beach Boys sunny harmony thing.  Sorry, no my thing.  They could have evolved more like Catherine Wheel whom I recommend highly.  Also try Ride (of course) and Slowdive+music
The Greatest Show On Earth+P+Most of Em's fans think that The Marshall Mathers LP is his best work but I beg to differ. The Eminem Show is his greatest album for many reasons. 1-He handled all the production except 3 songs ("Business", "Say What U Say", & "My Dad's Gone Crazy") all of which was produced by the great Dr. Dre, 2-he kept all guest appearances to a minimum, 3-his flow improved greatly. The best song has to be "Square Dance", a song that show how well he rides the beat with ease. Let's hope Em can put out another album that can match the intensity of The Eminem Show.  Top 5 Songs 1. Square Dance 2. Say What U Say f/ Dr. Dre 3. Say Goodbye Hollywood 4. When The Music Stops f/ D12 5. Til I Collapse f/ Nate Dog+music
catchy at first, but angst fades with age...+N+I read in Manson's bio that the singer for this band was a groupie of his. And it shows. This cd is a clean, more innocent version of Manson's first cd.   Her voice is nice and catchy, but the content wont appeal to many peole over the age of 16. This was a cd that was made to get quick appeal and then fade away just as fast+music
Music to get your blood flowing!+P+Wow!  Great quartets played with real gusto and dynamism by the Prager String Quartet.  The sound is incredibly crisp and clear.  The performances are impeccable.  You won't be disappointed+music
Outstanding!+P+The series of "Golden Age of American Rock & Roll" released by ACE couldn't have a better end. During the past 15 years they have delighted us with a series of 10 CD's with 30 songs each remembering the Rock & Roll era mostly with minor top hits between 1954 and 1963. One reason for their tremendous success is the superb quality of all the recordings no matter from what year the original song was. Now besides these series of 10 CD's from the R&R era they have launched another 2 special editions with the same title: one with the special novelty edition and another with the special country edition. Both deserve more than 5 stars.  The song selection on the novelty edition is just out of sight! Most of the songs brought back memories from a long long time ago since these weren't available after the time they were top hits. I never found them back on what compilation so ever until ACE put them all together 45 years later. And with a sound quality better than in their original version on 45rpm. Therefore don't hesitate. Buy it together with the country edition and you will have 60 songs for utmost pleasure; 60 songs we grew up with and now with no scratches on them.  +music
Totally Greatest!!!!!!!!!!!!!+P+If they had an unlimited number of stars, there wouldn't be enough room for all mine! This is a great CD with nearly ALL of my favorite Toby Keith songs! They're all super, but my favorites are I WANNA TALK ABOUT ME, THE ANGRY AMERICAN (I love that song!), BEER FOR MY HORSES (love that song next!), YOU AIN'T MUCH FUN, and SHOULD'VE BEEN A COWBOY.   Toby Keith has such a great voice! And he isn't a liberal either, might I add. (Warning: If you're a Dixie Chicks fan, you're going to hate this CD.)   Great buckle on his belt on the cover picture of the CD+music
What a Marvelous Album!!! Deitrick My Brother You've Done It Again+P+One thing I love about Deitrick, besides being annointed and a great singer, is that he stick with the themes of his albums names whether it be crossroads, or lost and found every song reflects what a person maybe going through in those stages. Nonetheless, Crossroads is a classic gospel album from start to finish. It should have gone a trillion times platinum, but hey he will get his recognition in due time. Amen to that. Ok, 7 days is mainly a celebration ablum, after all God did create everything in 7 days and that is something to celebrate about, with hot and funky beats that will have you dancing all over the place. Don't get me wrong the album does have traditional church songs and content but its a bit more funkier. Just imagine "God is Good" mixed with "Unity" mixed with "God didn't give up on me" through a whole album. This is the best way to explain it. Deitrick my friend, you are my favorite Gospel artist and truely annointed. I thank God for you everyday, Amen to that. Thank you Deitrick for obeying the Lords will to make wonderful music and most of all I thank God for creating you to make this wonderful music. All Glory is yours Jesus! Amen and Amen. Go and Get it!+music
A surprised non fan+P+I am not a fan of the Carpenters but when I was younger (25 years ago) I knew a lot of their songs but considered my self a "rock and roller" without a decent gear to listen to.  With good equipment on hand now and collecting albums of my youth in SACD format, I decided to buy this one and was surprised that the remastering was one of the best I have heard.  I am a stereo only person because I do not find the hometheater enjoyable.  I tried it for 5 years (from 1991) but did not get the satisfaction I have now with my stereo equipment.  My equipment has high end sound with a medium high end price.  To this day, I have yet to hear a system better sounding than mine  (Yes I am biased!).  High end does not mean excellent sound because I tried to listen to well known brands and I could not get satisfied with the sound.  I believe the key to good sounds are the amplifier  specs that only two manufacturers still specify. Slew rate and damping factor.  One is Australian and the other Swiss.  I have the Australian brand to beat.  Speakers  and interconnects are secondary but to me, electrostatic speakers are king! SACD players that are mid range suffice+music
Pretty well as good as Innervisions+P+Just a bit less evolved.  The songs on this album are absolutely brilliant.  With a wide range of styles, there's something on this album for everyone - only the songs You and I and You've Got It Bad Girl are anything less than fantastic, in fact.  You Are The Sunshine Of My Life - very good, original song.  Not his best, but still good. Maybe Your Baby - an awesome groove, nice synth bass, but maybe it goes on a bit too long. You And I - not a bad ballad, nowhere near as good as Blame It On The Sun, but has its own charm. Tuesday Heartbreak - very joyful sounding song.  Good tension between the verses and chorus, great melodies throughout, and excellent drums. You've Got It Bad Girl - a bit jazzy experimental.  Not bad. Superstition - Good dance tune, very funky, with a powerful horn riff that Peter Gabriel would later rip off in 'Sledgehammer'. Big Brother - awesome clavinet tune, angry lyrics, nice melody. Blame It On The Sun - this is one of the best ballads, written, ever!  Really.  He does this kind of ballad on every album, but this is the best of them, with a soaring (or wailing) verse that slides into an emotional chorus. Lookin' For Another Pure Love - very original music, freestyle melody. I Believe (When I Fall In Love It Will Be Forever) - this is a real triumph, this is everything a song should be, with an awesome chorus that repeats 10 times at the end and you're not getting tired of it.+music
And The Hits Just Keep On Comin'+P+Just by saying this has been quite a year for the veteran crooner would be an understatement in itself. Barry Manilow began 2006 with the predecessor to this time capsule by debuting at #1 last February with The Greatest Songs Of The Fifties. In between that album release and this, he has continued to sell out his Las Vegas extravaganza, Music and Passion, five nights a week. The show is so successful that the Las Vegas Hilton recently extended Manilow's contract through 2008. He picked up his second Emmy Award this past August for the live on tape broadcast of that event, and with the release of this album, he has his highest-selling tally in a debut week than he has for any other album of his 32 year recording career. Barry also holds the distinction of being the only artist of 2006 to have two Top two records in Billboard in one calendar year. When it came to recording his follow-up to the "Fifties," juggernaut, it didn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what the concept would be. All it took was Clive Davis to help sort out the material and all systems were go. For the critics who have tarred and feathered Manilow since he hit #1 with his very first single, "Mandy" over three decades ago, you'd think by this time they'd cut him some slack. No dice. Manilow has even admitted he wouldn't know how to react if he heard a kind word from a critic, the Brooklyn-born writer, arranger, producer and crooner has always depended on the devotion of his fanbase. And it's not just any fanbase. These people are hardcore fans, dubbed "Fanilows." On this CD, we are treated to thirteen chestnuts that made the 60's one of the best eras in pop music history. The pop songs run the gamut of that decade offering everything from Bacharach to the Beatles and in between honest and original covers that include a sensational retooling of Frankie Valli's "Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You," which kicks the disc off into high gear. Other highlights among highlights include a duet with 60's supergroup, The Association, on their staples "Cherish" and "Windy" that Barry cleverly arranged as a medley. Elvis' gorgeous 1962 ballad "Can't Help Falling In Love" is lusciously delivered as is The Righteous Brothers 1965 anthem "You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'." Even the somewhat hokey #1 Dean Martin single "Everybody Loves Somebody" from 1964 fits in divinely as Manilow gives it as much warmth as Dino did over forty years ago. Sinatra's smash hit from 1966, "Strangers In The Night" is so effective, Franks' daughter, Tina, gave Manilow a thumbs-up for a sensational interpretation. Other pop staples included are the Herman's Hermits "There's A Kind Of Hush," Bacahrach's gorgeous song from '68 "This Guy's In Love With You,  as well as his '69 Oscar-winner "Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head." The Beatles shimmering 1964 ballad "And I Love Her" and Bobby Vinton's 1963 "Blue Velvet" is just as haunting as the original while the mood on the 1962 love anthem "When I Fall In Love" originally a hit for The Lettermen is optimistically heart-wrenching. The album ends on a positive note (pun intended) with the 1965 anthem for hope "What The World Needs Now Is Love." Never was that sentiment so true - never was a Manilow album this gratifying. Everything from song selections to Manilow's masterful arrangements to his honest readings, this record is easily ranked as one of the best of his storied career. Look for The Greatest Songs Of The Seventies inside a year. It doesn't take a fortune teller to figure that one out+music
WASTED MY MONEY+N+What a total hack.  Do people really think this guy has talent?  He is ruining the genre!  Stupid me bought the CD because it seemed to be everywhere...big mistake.  AVOID+music
Singin' in the Bathtub+N+I dont see what people like about this CD. My 14 month old son and I looked at each other in disgust when I first played it!!! Very irritaing CD dont buy it!!! I am returning it today.+music
Art- He`s Simply the  Best+P+A great collection of Arts solo stuff, which include his 2 brillant chart no one`s &quot;I Only Have Eyes For You&quot; &amp; &quot;Bright Eyes.&quot; There is quite a few songs off &quot;The Art Garfunkel  Album&quot; such as the romantic &quot;I Believe When I Fall In Love It`ll  Be For Ever&quot;  &amp; &quot;99 Miles From L.A.&quot;   &quot;Watermark&quot; from the album from the same name. But surprisingly  only  a a couple of tracks, from the very well put together album  &quot;Fate For Breakfast.&quot; All in all it`s a great album, with a   great selection of songs. So if you like chill out tunes, after a stressful  day, buy this album. I can guantee, it will de-stress you+music
Still great after nearly 30 years!+P+I first got Believe It as a used record in the late 70's. Wow! This CD includes 2 rather short LPs, but you are getting it for the first one - Believe It! which was the single best hard-fusion record ever made. It's also a great bridge from the world of rockers dabbling in jazz (Bruford's early band, Brand X, etc.) to a real jazz outfit that happens to rock hard. I never tire of listening to this one with it's wonderful blend of Tony's great drumming, some of the best guitar work Holdsworth has ever done and just enough funk to keep it from ever getting too serious. Buy it and crank it up+music
WTF???????!!!!!!!+N+This is PT worst album made. Every track on this album is bad! Lame lyrics, awful beats and there in no decent guests on this album. Murda man was a awful diss track to Lil Jon, PT has lost his game thats all. Also I wanna why PT has the beef with lil jon anyway. If you want so good albums get Trill by Bun B, Ghetto Bill Gates by Master P.+music
A Sonic Assault+N+I remember that just before I bought this in 1993 I was pretty fed up with the state of Guitar Playing. At the time, the gloom and doom of the latest wave had settled over the world of guitar playing like a rain cloud. This guy turned it all around for me.  I have seen and heard some of the greatest guitar players more than once but what Danny did on this album is mind boggling. The thing is, it is pure, honest, beautiful, mean, technically impressive, music. Just a box of ear candy.  If you appreciate a good guitar player than you are in for a treat. There has never been anybody whom I recommended this album to that was disappointed. +music
not worth it+N+This is definitely one of the worst cd purchases i've made.  The Cd is poorly organized, and most of the music isn't as good as one would think.  the songs that ARE worth listening to though, are: Disc 1: 8. Halifax - "sydney" 11. Say Anything - "Woe" 15. I can make a mess like nobody's business - "The best happiness money can buy" 56. Patent Pending - "Los Angeles"  Disc 2: 1. Hellogoodbye - "Homewrecker" 5. Jack's Mannequin - "Kill the messenger" 8. Matchbook Romance - "My Eyes Burn"  Other than that, this is really a minimal value Cd, in my opinion+music
Buy the book and the CD!+P+This is a must-have CD for any parent who likes introducing the simple joys of great music to their kids.  My mom and dad (both in their late sixties) enjoy listening, too, and my child can ask her grandmother about other songs from "back in the day."    Get the book, too!  Nicky's really big personality shines through as he rubs elbows, er-paws, with some jazz heavy-hitters.  Your child will love the photos and will also discover some great new vocabulary words like bop-a-re-bop. The CD and book have proven to be a great gift combo.    Take a listen and enjoy! +music
Ja Rule - Rule 3:36+P+After his successful debut, Ja Rule didn't take no time whipping up his second album.  "Rule 3:36" spawned the hit singles, "Between Me and You" and "Put It on Me."  It was released in Fall of 2000.  Can Ja do it again and release another very solid effort or will he fall to the sophomore curse?  1. Intro - No Rating  2. Watching Me - Very Short - 4.5/5  3. Between Me and You (Featuring Christina Milian) - 4/5  4. Put It on Me (Featuring Vita) - 3.5/5  5. 6 Feet Underground - 4/5  6. Love Me, Hate Me - 3.5/5  7. Die (Featuring Caddillac Tah, Black Child & Dave Bing) - 4.5/5  8. F*** You (Featuring O-1 & Vita) - 4.5/5  9. I'll F*** U Girl (Skit) - No Rating  10. Grey Box (Skit) - No Rating  11. E***** (Featuring Caddillac Tah, Black Child & Jayo Felony) - 3.5/5  12. It's Your Life (Featuring Shade Sheist) - 4/5  13. I Cry (Featuring Lil' Mo) - 3.5/5  14. One of Us - 5/5  15. Chris Black (Skit) - No Rating  16. The Rule Won't Die - Very Short - 3/5  47.5/60  3.5 Stars  Wow I can't believe my ears, Ja Rule sold out big time!  He almost dropped his whole street style completely and pretty much filled this album with all commercialized pop-rap music.  Some of it is good no doubt but this isn't an album you can bump and nod your head to.  Good for a couple listens then probably never again.  Mannn Ja what happened to you+music
Thug Rap??? Please...(2.5 stars)+N+A lot of people are meriting Ja's credibility on all his albums because he has been able to keep his voice on the airwaves since 1998. So he released his sophomore album Rule 3:36 in Sept 2000, that is one of the worst Ja albums I've heard (not the worst, The Last Temptation takes that title).   Ja tries to be "gangstafied" on this album but fails terribly. Starting with the first single "Me & You" thinking his thug style can attract women. I haven't bought the concept in 2000, and I'm still not buying it six years later. Or how about the flat falling track "F*** You" featuring Vita and 01?  Or as many revewers have pointed out that he tries to boast his singing vocals on this album, which seriously damages his creditablity. How about the song "Put It On Me" before Lil Mo joined song. Sounds wack(er) with out her. Or how about the late Barry White imitation on the song "Extacy" (and thats one of the decent tracks on this album). Oh and remember when "Between Me & You" was highly antacipated that you downloaded the single on Napster? Well do you remember that the origonal/demo that some of you downloaded didn't have Christina Millian singing the hook, but had Ja singing it himself. Thank god that wasn't on the album.    Now there are some listenable tracks on this album that I would like to point out. "6 Feet" is a standout track, and is possibly the best track on this album and my personal favorite. "Watching Me" is another tight track, as Ja spits with a load of energy within him. "I Cry" and as mentioned earlier "Extacy" are decent at best. Other than that, most of the tracks on this album are skippable.  Overall, a sub medicore Ja Rule album. Most of the 4 and 5 star reviewers are either big time Ja Rule fans or just in love with mainstream overrated rap ("Put It On Me" [Remix]). To me, this album is nothing else but a pop rap, falsafied thug rap album that just doesn't appeal to me. I recommend this to hardcore Ja Rule fans if they don't have this already.

Amps are hot, recording is warm+P+The songs on this album are outstanding, the writing is direct, the themes are the same ones Neil has always sung about, making relationships last over time, country living, the road.  But the way this album was recorded is probably the main reason I keep coming back.  Obviously the guitars are all melting and the amps are overdriven and the songs are free-form, but the vocals are right where I want them, and the guitars are so warm that the album never agitates me (and believe me, I've listened to some agitating music - Teengenerate anyone?).  I guess the fifth star is gained by the fact that the songs and the band are still more important than the medium, this album isn't noteworthy for its use of feedback and hot guitars, but because everything fits, in a smooth and soulful way.  Never gimmick.  Always authentic.  Neil transcends the genre again+music
Pulling For The Real Rocky On Next Album+N+I am originally from The Land of Ten Thousand Lakes myself (and there's a hell of a lot more than ten thousand lakes, by the way).  I am also a musician, singer, and writer of a "country roots" perspective (who now lives 40 min. outside NYC), who understands how crappy the business can be.   My biggest complaint about Rockie, my fellow Minnesotan, is simply this:  He and his music don't sound like they come from Minnesota, nor Carolina (his birthplace, am I correct?), and lotsa' good country music comes from these two regions.  I mean, this record is produced well and sounds generally good, but he sounds like someone who is taking the advice of all the jackasses from Nashville who say, "Ya' gotta' sound like this and look like this; 'cause that's what works down here, plain and simple!"    Well, I think that theory is gonna' die sooner than later.  You gots guys like Djerks Bently and Eric Church who are still not exactly where country needs to be, but they are making a slight dent in the "soccer-momming" of country music.    Wanna' hear good country music?  Check out 10 City Run!  They are what CMT should be airing, and they are getting airplay on "Wide Open Country" (seriously, check out this band, and my review of them--10 City Run--for they're the real frickin' deal).   So Rockie, my friendly advice would be this: drop the affected, mainstream, country radio accent (don't replace it with a hard-core Minnesota accent, however--Fargoooo--no good), get a band that plays more than one kind of country music, and draw on the great history of music that has come from Minnesota (Jayhawks, Replacements, even Marvin Rainwater, oh, and that Bob Dylan-dude) and Carolina (too many influences to even start!) 'cause that's you, man! That's where you're from! That's how you'll sound genuine (as the one reviewer noticed how at times you seemed to be trying too hard, other times, not hard enough)!  My theory: Your hearts not in it!    You have tremendous talent and I'm pulling for you, the next album, and the Vikings--the last, more reluctantly each year.    God Speed,  Bryan  SW Connecticut +music
Not So Like More of Mark+N+Another reviewer has stated that Mark often.It's good songs.Small package.Bring home some milk ok?It gets out stains too+music
More Than the 2 Hits...+N+I love The Foundations who made a lot of great music in the sixties. Of course everyone has heard "Baby Now That I've Found You" and "Build Me Up Buttercup", but they had so many great songs. I had a ten inch compilation from the early'80's with about ten songs, all of which are on this disc. They would've fit in very well with a lot of the Motown groups, although they were a multi-racial English band. I mistakenly gave this recording one star when I intended five.+music
Gave it a few listens but....+N+Like fingernails on a blackboard - the instruments, the singer's voice, the melodies+music
I love it and can't stop repeating it (on my cd player)+P+I was lucky enough to see this show three times:  twice on the Northwestern University Campus (original musical title was "a long gay book,") and a third time at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago.  This show is stunning.  I found myself humming melodies from the show - even though I hadn't seen it in over a year (and didn't own the recording)!  The music and lyrics have a way of staying with you.  This is a real work of art - poetry and song, based on the work of Gertrude Stein.    If you're a fan of musicals with soul, wit, and class, then you'll love this.  The voices of Christine Mild and Jenny Powers (Little Women) are extraordinary and Cindy Gold's narration is engaging and uniquely powerful.  Combine these talents with that of Frank Galati (Tony Award Winner ... Director, Adapted Script) and Stephen Flaherty (Ragtime, etc.) and you have one AMAZING musical.    Highly Recommended!!!+music
Ahh Geese let's see about this album!+N+Get it,Buy it and own it before they do.Also you won't mind if I said this,Right?Um.. I don't think you guys should buy this album because it's not really good.I think it would be very weird if you did anyway.I don't wanna buy this album because it's really comparing the songs from disneymania1,2&3.That's why I give it one star.+music
I wanted the music on CD -- not the movie on CD+N+I really enjoy the great synthesizer sound (usually this phrase would be an oxymoron) of this film.  John Carpenter is definitely a multi-talented artist (writer, director, composer).  So, I am not in any way criticizing the music itself.  My gripe is against this particular CD release.  I was expecting to receive a CD with only the music.  Unfortunately, very few of these tracks are music only.  Most of them are music accompanied by dialogue from the movie.  If this only happened once or twice, I wouldn't mind so much.  But it's nearly every single track.  Would you buy the STAR WARS soundtrack if it had a whole bunch of dialogue on the tracks?  How about THE GODFATHER, LORD OF THE RINGS, GLADIATOR, or any other great motion picture soundtrack?  If people want the dialogue, then they will surely buy the DVD.  But most people buy a soundtrack for the sole purpose of having the music only+music
Last Rose of Summer-Deanna Durbin+N+You have sent an e-mail inviting me to give my opinion on this item.I am sorry I cannot go over 2 stars as unfortunately there is a defect on last track of the record, precisely on the song  "The last Rose of Summer".Anyhow I intend to buy other Deanna Durbin's records as I enjoy very much her voice, but unfortunately the wallet is empty now. Thanks for all your help on trying to find "Shane: a Tribute to Victor Young"but no euccess. I will try to buy another item later.   +music
"Won't You Try?" +P+Jefferson Airplane tried hard, on this 1967 utterly noncommercial followup to their phenomenally successful classic SURREALISTIC PILLOW. Having made RCA millions of dollars with PILLOW, the Airplane took full advantage of their newly-minted blank check to create what may be the purest example of musical psychedelia to come out of the Sixties.  Listening to AFTER BATHING AT BAXTER'S is literally a trip. Bizarrely torqued lyrics are wedded to experimental recording techniques, sound montages, and off-center tempos and rhythms to provide the listener with an auditory hallucination. Everything goes, and so it went at BAXTER'S. It was all new, avant-garde to excess, and it largely failed to reach its fullest potential.   Most art does fail, but there's no question that BAXTER'S cross-pollinated with many other performers and musical styles. The influence of BAXTER'S can be heard in "Revolution 9" by The Beatles, and on many other recordings of the era. BAXTER'S may have sold poorly, but it was heard by the Airplane's contemporaries, and it clearly served as a wellspring of inspiration. An aficionado's album, AFTER BATHING AT BAXTER'S is a ghost in the machine that remains haunting even today.   +music
CRYIN' TIME INDEED!+N+How fast can you say m-i-s-t-a-k-e? Rimes, the adolescent singing sensation, covering Joplin's "Me and Bobby McGee?" Patsy's "Crazy" and "I Fall to Pieces?" Buck's "Cryin' Time?" Cryin' time indeed+music
Puddle of Mudd - My New Favorite Album+P+If you like Nickelback and Theory of a Deadman, you are in for a treat. This group rocks! Where Nickelback's Chad punches out his lines (most excellent), Puddle of Mudd is very melodious and has a great all-round sound going. This album is absolutely their best work to date and I am excited to hear some new tunes from this awesome band. Keep 'em coming! :+music
good album, not great but+P+You can certainly see where the band should go.  It's a powerful album in some senses, but overall, it's just good.  Pick it up, understanding that it's just good rock/grunge/whatever.  Enjoy. +music
This album wasn't that good+N+I didn't like this album that much. Only songs i liked are The MC, Step Into A World, A Friend, Can't Stop Won't Stop. Just To Prove A Point song was horrible and i don't know why he tried to do a rock song. Putting Puff Daddy on the Step Into A World remix was a terrible decision by KRS. The songs were too short on this album also.+music
Fantastic+P+This album took me awhile to get into, but it really is fantastic.  None of the songs have lyrics, it's all about the electric guitar.  Some of the songs jam, and some are more mellow, beautiful peices.  There are a couple duds that I never listen to (namely, "Trundrumbalind" and "Raspberry Delta Jam-V", and "Up In The Sky" I also usually skip), but the rest of the songs are fantastic.  "Train Of Angels" is the best of the bunch, along with "Love Thing" (gorgeous).  "Time" is also a fantastic, dreamy track, "A Piece Of Liquid" is relaxing and sounds like something you'd listen to in the caribbean before it goes into some cool "night-time-sounding" soloing.  It's impossible not to tap your feet during "Psycho Monkey" or "House Full Of Bullets",and I love the awesome playing at 1:40 in "Secret Prayer".  "With Jupiter In Mind" and "Crystal Planet" are great space-themed rockers, and "Lights Of Heaven" is one of Joe's best.   If you only buy ONE Satriani album, I first and formost recommend The Electric Anthology and Surfing With The Alien, but then I also recommend you pick up Crystal Planet, and Time Machine (not the most consistent album, but there are some here that you simply can't miss)+music
Doris Day Christmas Collection+P+Just like Perry Como..Doris Day does the same her Christmas songs take me back in time.. And I searched for this Album on the internet the best price was Amazon        Thank you agai+music
Why did I buy This?+N+What's worse than a bad cd?  "The Burdens of Being Upright."  I don't even know where to start.  I bought it because I really liked the first song "Mother Mother" (which is the only reason why Tracy Bonham even gets 2 stars from me)... and I was completely disappointed with the rest of the album.  The songs aren't interesting and the whole thing all in all is just simply not worth the money.  Unless its used and only costs like, two bucks.  Actually, when I went to to trade it in at the record store, they only offered me 25 cents for it because they have so many copies of it and nobody wants them.  And I took the quarter! If you like grunge music, there's a chance that you might like this, but you most likely still won't+music
Without Reason!+P+I also do not understand the negative reaction to this album.  Fine, its not what many expected...its better!  Saddoes, get over it...this the Best Album Of 2006.  Their sound has matured and if its not your style move on, don't pan it..+music
This album wasn't that good+N+I didn't like this album that much. Only songs i liked are The MC, Step Into A World, A Friend, Can't Stop Won't Stop. Just To Prove A Point song was horrible and i don't know why he tried to do a rock song. Putting Puff Daddy on the Step Into A World remix was a terrible decision by KRS. The songs were too short on this album also.+music
Over produced+N+wow. i've never really been a fan but i respect their lead guitarist.He's done alot of great work... but damn this cd ain't even catchy one bit.  you can hear the pitch fixer on benji's voice throughout the entire cd... it's bad. like realllllly bad. and it's way over produced..+music
Fire coming out of ya speaker+P+As a devoted Jigga fan, this album was everything and above what I expected. Every track from beginning to last consist of stellar production with complex rhymes. Jay shows off his wide array skills and versatillity with backshots at Nas(Takeover), radio cuts(I.Z.Z.O), emotional wordplay(Song Cry). Highlights include "Girls, Girls, Girls", "Never Change", and is topped off with "Renegade" which in my opinion CONTAINS HIP-HOP'S GREATEST VERSE OF THE PAST 10 YEARS by Eminem. Even the bonus tracks would be leads for the next rapper. Jay has been called commercial, but who ever says that ain't listening.+music
Capturing a Legend+P+This CD captures the experience of a live performance with Elvis.You realize again what a unique voice Elvis possessed and how much you miss him. I liked the CD and recommend it to Elvis fans+music
skip this, get the good songs elsewhere+N+Raven on her own is sophisticated, but cheetah girls is for little girls - cheezy! As are most of these tracks not by real artists with CDs, just kids stuck together. 2 of Jesse Mccartney's worst songs - sorry! Some Chisty C. Romano tracks. "anyone but me" is a gem, get her EP instead. Hayden's "My Hero..." is great also, this girl can sing! She's also on the Ice Princess Sndtrck ("I Fly")which i recommend in addition to "Go Figure" If they let her, she has a huge future+music
Slumberful!+P+I was given this cd as a gift for my newborn daughter and it is wonderful!  I am buying it again because it is starting to skip I have played it so much.  It doesn't get old and I even enjoy falling asleep to it while I am listening to the baby monitor+music
Nothing compared to his first album.+N+Mack 10 couldn't do it twice.  His first album is tight, but this one  lacks good beats.  Also, his rapping style is too lame to carry the off  beats.  The only way could have saved the album is if he would have had  alot of guest rappers and producers+music
Cub Koda Could Really Rock!!!( Rest In Peace Man)+P+This album contains the Classic Rock song "Smokin' In The Boy's Room" which a lot of my peers did back in High School.Back then they used to smoke filter cigarettes. Sadly these days the filter cigarettes have now been replaced with a more potent addictive drug. Anyway back to the album. The guitarist and singer of this band Cub Koda was a Wild Man of Rock who was always great to watch in action as he jumped from one place to another on stage. They don't make them like him anymore. This album ROCKS so play it LOUD and forget about the neighbours!!!+music
BMG ruined Elvis' Blue Christmas+N+I wish I had never owned the original recording of this album because THIS "version" is a sorry compilation disc distributed by BMG/Sony that hardly compares to the original. If you can find the original, get THAT, for this compilation disc does not contain some of the selections and suffers greatly for it+music
The greatest country Christmas album!+P+The best country music Christmas CD I have ever heard.  I have always been a fan of Randy Travis.  During Christmas, this CD is continously being played on my stereo.  I would recommend this album to anybody who likes  Christmas music not just Randy Travis fans+music
A must for any cross country or track runner+P+I heard this CD when I was watching an indoor track meet. One of my dad's runners showed me the CD and I listened to it. My Mom bought it for me back in 1997 as one of the first CDs I ever had. It is probably the best classical music CD I have ever owned or to which I have listened. If you run cross country or track this CD is a must as it gets you going gradually, especially the song "Titles." A must CD for runners and anyone else who likes nice classical background music.+music
You Won't Get Sick of This One+P+We've been listening to this one every night for 16months, and we still love it.  The music is beautiful, not cloying or sweet.  And maybe it's just because we don't understand the lyrics, but it doesnt' get tiresome or seem condescending like so much children's music does. Not every song is a winner - there's one that's slightly annoying -- but basically, this is music I'd listen to even if I didn't have twins. Plus, as soon as it goes on my kids start nodding off.  Maybe it's just a Pavlovian response, but hey, whatever works+music
BEST PUNK BAND EVER+P+This is what punk is all about. Fast music, ripping bass solos, and good ... lyrics. The casualties is what hardcore punk is all about. I highly recomend this to any hardcore punk fa+music
SCOOTER!!!+P+great album, super tracks and nothing more you can ask for, just simply amazing album! i highly reccomend it! SCOOTER 4ever+music
Does some good pickin' and a grinnin'!+N+Steve Martin has become a cultural staple in the comic community.  With hysterical films and outlandish Saturday Night Live performances, it would be obvious that Martin would be a great choice to do a comic album.  Well, in this film guys opinion, you are going to need to be a big fan of Martin to stomach this album.  His humor is offbeat, never quite following a pattern or direction.  Instead of actual jokes, he resorts to making noises on the album that I am sure are funny in person, but listening to it just comes off a failure.  His "Cat Handcuffs" bit is humorous, but the rest becomes obvious that somebody was looking to cash in on Martin's popularity.  I would have loved to see Steve Martin in concert during his younger days, I am sure that he would make me laugh my socks off, but it just doesn't translate well to day's style.  I am sorry Steve, but I liked your other album better.  Grade: ** out of ****+music
The Verdict Is In . . .+N+YAAAAAAAAWWWWWWNNN! Don't even bother buying and listening to this CD. Every song on here lacks emotion, meaningful lyrics, and any type of memorable melody. Standards are set so low that any untalented fool can get a record deal, sample to their hearts content, and win a Grammy. Skip this and get Stevie Wonders greatest hits collection+music
Not what I was specting+N+I saw Draco on a tv show and I liked the song he played so I read some reviews looking for a CD and I ended up ordering Vagabundo.  I did not like any of the songs from that CD.  His lirics and music are not that great+music
A Slice of Texas+P+Texas is home to many different musical styles, and Adolph Hofner is one of those artists who seems to capture nearly every one of them in his recordings.  What strikes me is that while many would label his music as &quot;diverse,&quot; Hofner would probably have just called it &quot;music.&quot;  The fact that Hofner is not well known and celebrated nationally puzzles me, for I believe he is one of the great Texas recording artists of all time, which puts him in grand company+music
Amazing+P+What an amazing DVD, not only the music is great the visual effects are extraordinary.  A definite must buy+music
Very disappointing+N+It feels as though she has lost her energy, she has become a distant memory of what she used to be with Mecano. Still a sweet voice, the songs chosen for this CD are mediocre. Her first solo CD was good, this was is not. The music just doesn't click, the art in the sleeve doesn't click either, maybe she needs new composers, a different producer. The Pink Floyd track is regrettable, she should not sing in English, she can sing in Spanish and French but I would suggest her to refrain from doing it in English. Maybe the Cano brothers should compose her new material, maybe Mecano should make a comeback...+music
what are these official reviewers thinking?+N+this not a terrible album, but it is not that good either, and this, when  coupled with the fact that there are many other bands doing very similar  things much better than knapsack, means that it probably isn't worth the  investment. i have never heard any of their other albums, but this one had  neither wonderful guitar work nor intriguing vocals, and the lyrics (which  have been called brilliant by one of the official reviewers) leave  something to be desired. the first time you hear this album, you will  probably like it, but after three or four more times all the way through, i  think you will probably be either skipping half the songs, taking the album  out after three songs, or running to your local used cd store to get some  of your poorly invested money back. it just doesn't have that lasting  quality that a great album has; this album does not leave you wanting more,  as a brilliant album would do. in short, not a terrible album but not worth  paying full price for, especially when there are so many bands out their  which are doing the whole emo-punk-pop thing much better+music
It is great for a greatest hits album+P+Yes, it is missing some good songs from ELO (I would've like to see All Over The World from Xanadu on here and Rockaria, my favorite ELO song, among others). But this is a Greatest Hits album, not a 'All the good songs from ELO' album. This isn't for die hard fans, it's for casual fans who heard a few songs on the radio and want a greatest hits album to hear some other tunes. The songs on here are great and will probably influence them to buy ELO's other full length albums.+music
DAYTON SAYS:  BUY THIS CD+P+From the intimate clubs of the world to the stage at Kennedy Center in Washington, DC, Lynne Arriale continues to prove why she is the First Lady of Melodic Jazz.  I do not believe that I can adequately describe her music and that of the great Lynne Arriale Trio, and so I would encourage you to listen to some of the "cuts" here at Amazon.  Not only is Lynne an excellent composer, she and her trio interpret the music of other's like no one else.  Listen to their interpretation of Burt Bacharach's "A House Is Not A Home" and see if it doesn't rip your heart out.  I cannot recommend the music of the Lynne Arriale Trio enough.  Why not take a moment and enrich your life buy making a purchase of the Trio's latest release: Inspiration.  And, while you're at it, if you don't have their other recordings, may I suggest to add them to your music library as well.  You will NOT be disappointed.  I am happy to end this review in the way I most often like to:  DAYTON SAYS:  BUY THIS CD+music
Prince on Only one song +N+Were is my boy Prince man this really ticked me off he is only on one song first disc just another sucker then you dont hear him anymore maybe they were alking about us if your a prince fan dont buy this unless you collect his songs like i do cause just another sucker is all you get for a person that collects i dont have that one+music
This is one of the very best Burrel recordings.+P+This often overlooked CD is probably the very best all around recording of Kenny's.  It's got everything!  It's bluesy and beautiful and the material is very well rounded.  The tune &quot;Since I Fell For You&quot; sounds  like it could have been written for Kenny and &quot;'Round Midnight&quot;  maybe the definitive version of an often recorded masterpiece. Buy this  record.  You won't regret it+music
Sad...+N+I'm a metal head but I'm not a fan of this type of metal but the quality is good and these guys are somewhat from my area, but I'm just not a fan of the Rah, Rah, Rah, Blah, Blah screaming mess. I love the guitars and the band itself just NO vocals and melody. It's very one dimensional, but different strokes for different folks. If you like war hooting and demon squealing Death Metal then you'll love this. Sorry guys not a fan of it (just an opinion though, don't get bent over it)+music
Rushed+N+The album is rushed, being produced just in 8 days.  It did not showcase Casey's talent and sales charts speak even louder. Poor Casey. She deserves a better album than this+music
Terrible sound+N+I was suckered into buying this years ago and the sound was so bad that I immediately sold it as used for pennies on the dollar.  I strongly suggest you buy another anthology of their music instead+music
supergroup, huh?+N+Damn Yankees was a supergroup containing Ted Nugent,Tommy Shaw(STYX),Jack Blades(Nightranger)and someother guy. All talented musicians, who are best heard in their prespective groups. Damn Yankees just doesn't rock,like it should. I've given it a chance and just can't get into it. A lot of talent involved, just doesn't do anything for me+music
Amazing music from an amazing band!+P+Every track on this album is a standout.  An instant classic from a classic band.  The boys have never rocked harder, sang better, and grooved groovier.  I can't get this CD out of player.  I can't get the hooks out of my mind- I go to sleep at night humming one of the tunes, usually the Joseph Williams-sung chorus on "Bottom of Your Soul."  I absolutely loved the guest musicians on this record- James Pankow(Chicago)and Ian Anderson (Jethro Tull) especially.  I don't know if you can Call Steve Porcaro a "guest-musician," especially with artistic work with the overall sonic "canvas" and cool timbres he is able to evoke.  He is a genius. Why these guys can't get any radio airplay in the States anymore is beyond me.  They are so much better than all of the crap that comes out on the radio nowadays. I hope they tour the US hard for the next couple of years and win over old-fans and new converts.+music
Pretty Good+P+This Band is pretty good i think it had potenial to become better &quot;BoneThrower&quot; is prob the best song on here but i could be wrong all of the songs are worthy and could be hits its alot better than Limp Bizkit and Puddle Of Mudd which come from the same record company as these guys.....but i put this band in the standards of SoundGarden which is saying alot if you like SoundGarde+music
Excellent!+P+This cd rocks!  I bought it years ago and still listen to it all the time.  I love the indigo girls+music
A-Z Cool+P+Owning most of their output, this is my favorite, followed by "Mirror Conspiracy" and then "Cosmic Game". Re-mixed tunes from obscure (to me) artists segue into one another for over an hour's musical world tour, Thievery-Style.  Their musical perspective explores the best elements of each choice, moving on at the perfect time to keep you interested and wanting more. Unlike a lot of CDs, this set stays strong towards the end!  Stand outs: 'International Flight' 'Sea Groove' 'Cramp your Style' 'Re-return of the Original Artform' 'Expo in Tokyo' 'My French Brother'  Super-nice artwork and cover treatments.  Take this to a party only if you never want to see it again+music
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DON'T OWN THIS!!!!!!!!!!+P+This album is a classic...every f-in track....it'll take you back....waaaay back....it'll make you bounce,it'll make you angry,it'll lift you up,and it'll make you cry...a C.D. you cannot quit playing and always nice soul food to go back to...you gotta get it and you gotta get it now +music
Schenker is the professor +P+A recording that will stand the test of time and serve as a reminder of just what a genius Schenker is with a Gibson Flying V.  A lot of my friends listened to this CD for the first time and simply said; "Holy smokes! Where did he come from?" I then tell them he recorded this 25 years ago and was way younger than most of them.  They were all utterly speechless and now are fans.  What a great solo effort and Schenker came out of the gates with guns ablazing.  Incredible material, song writing, production and performance by all band members.  Simon Phillips is a very talented drummer and lays down some serious tracks.  Highlight of this CD is the solo at the end of "Lost Horizons", that is mind boggling guitar work that is beyond replication.  This is a staple for anyone who follows extreme guitar talent and has an appreciation for master guitar work that will live on as long as music is played.  Awesome!+music
Standout+P+Van Go Gan is excellent. I'd been waiting many months to recieve this cd and was thrilled and surprised once it arrived. Every song is strong in it's arrangements and vocals. In my estimation every track is interesting but with "Kiss Life", "International", "Sunrise Sunset" being standouts. This cd also contains a unique spin on "Now Sue" and never get tired of hearing "I Need You" which has interesting harmonies and background vocals. As one reviewer stated some songs are simple and uncluttered, it's just the vocals and a guitar done acoustically. This cd is always in rotation in my player and highly recommended+music
Great rythym section+P+As a jazz guitar player, i personally love stan getz, and to hear him with ray brown, one of my favorite and greatest bass players ever. This was also the first i have listened to Herb Ellis play, his parts are a bit quiet but hey all guitarist were quiet until Charlie Christian. All in Four Really great musicians playing together, if you like this , check out russell malone, ray brown and monty alexander's Cd.+music
Still a Lot of "Country" on this Crossover Album+P+In the 1990s, the Country Music began to go through some transitions. Country music which had for the most part stayed in a vacuum began to go mainstream and embrace other genres of music. As a result, the sound started to change. One artist that led this transition was Faith Hill.   Faith Hill had previously released two albums, but it was her 1998 breakthrough album "Faith" that helped her break into mainstream music.  Surprisingly, while "Faith" did cross-over into the mainstream, there still is a strong country element on this album.   By no means do I consider myself a Country Music expert.  The nice thing about "Faith" is that I believe it caters to a fan like myself that may not be deep into Country Music, but can appreciate many of the elements Country Music can bring to the table.   While "Faith" could be directed to a more casual fan like myself, I think the collection does an admirable job at addressing the fan who is deeper when it comes to the Country Music genre.   Faith Hill brings an interesting formula to this album.  Faith's role on the collection is primarily of vocalist.  Since she is focused on vocals, she is dependent on a solid cast of characters (musicians and songwriters) to support her effort.  On "Faith", this doesn't appear to be a problem.  She is surrounded by many top notch studio musicians and is given an oustanding slate of songs to work with.  Given this solid infrastructure, Faith is able to provide stellar vocals and produce a great product.   The interesting twist to this formula is that Faith Hill is a co-producer on all 12 songs.   Therefore she just isn't a "vocalist for hire".  She ultimately is deciding what the songs should be and how the final product should sound.  This is why "Faith" is a solid collection.  "This Kiss" was the song that made Faith Hill a household name on the mainstream music scene.   This was also the song that was my first introduction to Faith Hill.  In 1998, I first heard this song on the radio and it completely blew me away.   One reason why this song made it into the mainstream arena is that it does have qualities that make it sound like a "pop" song.  However, there is a true country element to this song - complete with Steel Guitar and Fiddle (played by Glen Duncan).    This instrumentation gives the song a most unique flavor.  The song features some very clever and catchy lyrics such as "It's a centrifugal motion; It's perpetual bliss; It's that pivotal moment".  The vocals are delivered with a very up-tempo pace (with little rests between the words) and that also contribute to the unique flavor.  This song features some great background vocals by Chris Rodriguez (who provides background vocals on several other songs on the album) and Beth Nielson Chapman (who is a co-writer for this song).  At first, upon purchasing "Faith", I expected it would basically be "This Kiss" and not much else.  However, after my first listen to this collection - I realized that this was not the case.   There were many other terrific songs that are included on this collection.   The second song "You Give Me Love" is also pretty catchy.  This has much more of a country element on this song.  This song is highlighted by some terrific drums and more Fiddle by Glen Duncan.   Although not as catchy a song, "Let Me Let Go" is worth mentioning.  The highlight of this particular song is background vocals by Vince Gill.  Gill is a master in the domain of steering Country Music toward the mainstream, but not abandoning the Country Music element.  This song clearly has a Country Element and it works.  This song also features a string section of viola players.  The Country Music element is alive and well in the song "Better Days".   This song was co-written by former Fleetwood Mac vocalist Billy Burnette.  This song also features Duncan's Fiddle.    The Country Music element is also present in the song "My Wild Frontier".   This is a powerful and sad song about a woman, who with her family moves into the Canadian Prairie.  Tragedy then strikes when the woman's baby son dies in his sleep.  This song is a great example of some of how a very well written song is made even better by some very emotional and powerful vocals by Faith.  The best song on the album is "The Secret of Life".   This song was co-written by Gretchen Peters, who is a songwriter that worked with Bryan Adams on "On a Day Like Today" and his "Unplugged" album.   The song is about exactly what the title says - telling little bits on what "the secret of life is".   No loss of a solid country feel in this song - including more great fiddle by Duncan.  Simple lyrics like "The Secret of Life is in Sam's Martini" (Sam is a character that is referred to in the song) or "The Secret of Life is a Good Cup of Coffee" give this song a very special quality.  Two other country element songs are that are solid are "Just to Hear You Say That You Love Me" and "The Hard Way".  In "Just to Hear You Say You Love Me", Faith does a terrific duet with her husband Tim McGraw.   As for "The Hard Way", this is very powerful song (more great Fiddle) and is best described by the lyrics "I Keep Livin and Lovin and Learnin The Hard Way".  Finally, "Me" is another good song - this song has more of a pop element and deals with a woman changing who she is.  On a side note, Sheryl Crow is a co-writer of "Somebody Stand By Me".  Not a great song, but worth mentioning.  All of the lyrics, studio musicians, songwriting and production credits are listed in the liner notes.  This album should appeal to Country Music and Mainstream fans.  Highly Recommended+music
jonny slips away+N+Lie to me and Wander this world are so much different and much much better, if you are a blues fan. I bought it for "Give me up again", which is in a very good version on the Clapton DVD "Crossroads Festival". The rest is more like a Prince style, Pitty, hardly any guitar, Jonny is slipping away from the blues+music
Much better album to round out his shows+P+Just saw the "kid" the other night and the tracks he played from Long Time Coming blew the house away. What is missing on the studio versions are the blistering (understatement) leads he incorporated. The title track and Give Me Up Again both earned well deserved standing ovations. I can't wait for a live album. Myself, I just mixed a CD incorporating the best of all three albums and Long Time Coming makes it an all around great listen.+music
no doubt about it this is a great cd!!! +P+As for these songs great!!! The cd in general cover and all super great!!! 5 stars on Westside Connection. This is probably my second favorite cd 1 after (2 Pac) these guys (Mac 10 WC and Ice Cube) they can rap and there beats these are the kinda songs I have bumpin in my ride all the time, this is what I call hard core oldschool rap. This is the kinda rap thats true not this rap crap!!! of today. I cant explain to you it's just the lyrics and the way they rap to them. You just put it all together and you get a really sick cd like this one (bow down). Now I have to say this is to another cd that I like every song on it it's just like the knew akwid, I love every song on that cd but on this 1 I do have favorites like of course (Bow Down, Gangsta's Make The World Go Round, Do You Like Crimainals, The Gangsta The Killer And The Dope Dealer, Westside Ho, Hoo Banin) damm!!! thats like most of the cd but I got to tell you all the songs are great this is definitly a must bump in your ride cd believe me  this cd will have you bumpin. westside connection you doin fine!!!+music
Thanks Jerry Only!!! Thanks a lot!!!+N+I don't need "MISFITS" wannabe's in the good ol' united states so I definetely dont need some woah woah ooh crap sung in japanese! Buy Earth a.d., Static Age,Walk Among Us,Legacy of Brutality or hell even Evilive to see what these losers wish they were. Just cause your songs are like fater than hell doesn't mean their good+music
A soul crying out for love, like all souls do...+P+This is undeniably a tragic yet great album.  A friend of mine can't play it anymore, because he can't stand hearing a soul in torment, which is what the album is.  It's so naked emotionally.  Spence just bears everything, his very being, his very soul.  The only other albums that come close to this is Nick Drake's final studio album, Pink Moon, and Lee Hazlewood's emotionally wretching Requiem for an Almost Lady.  I won't recount Spence's back story, for other reviewers have done it very well.  The songs go right to your very being.  There is no BS here.  This was who Spence was at the time, warts and all.  It is a testament to another sensitive, young soul destroyed by celebrity, the "business", drugs, etc., etc..  This was Spence's only real solo album, and it's a true masterpiece, mysterious, moving, and beautiful. +music
The Facts+N+This work was recorded at Eastern Sound in Toronto under the worst of creative conditions,produced by Vinnie Testa who's only claim to fame was supposedly being aquainted with Shadow Morton who produced the Fudge.The album was released on MGM Lion and followed the release of the single Lost Son which was a London Parrot single. Now the facts:Earth Omen,New Horizon and Lost Son were in truth composed as a trilogy by Jon Wearing who had been working with another Michigan artist and associate Dick Wagner after the demise of the Frost.Wagner went on to form Ursa Major and Wearing who had been working in the Detroit music scene since 1966 with the Tidalwaves and had a hit Farmer John signed with Pink with the agreement for the first work 20% of his writing would be distributed equally among the other members of the band who were totally lost and down and out. Testa and Wearing could never see eye to eye, the management had no idea what they were doing, IRS and legal issues and the entire project was a wash and Wearing left to form a very good R&B influenced rock band called Deluxe. Deluxe toured with Joe Walsh, James Cotton, Atlanta Rhythm Section,opened for Seger and many others.Dallas Hodge,Ray Craig,KimballLee,Greg Caulder and Wearing comprised the band that had been targeted by Epic to sign. Leo Fenn part of the Alice Cooper business organization and Wearing pal was the manager until heads got out of control in part do to Johnny Winter's medling and then John Sinclair became the manager and demise of this fine act. Hodge continues to work with Canned Heat overseas and Wearing still provides moments with the Detroit based Ghostband.Wearing attempted to provide some quality to Pink however was stiffled by the mis-management of Clyde Stevers and Marv Wilson. Enough for now, The Truth+music
Great CD!+P+This greatest hits collection is a nice overview of Jermaine's work from the late '70s, through to the early '90s.  There are some great upbeat dance tracks along with some slow jams.  The only downside to this collection is that it doesn't include &quot;When the rain begins to fall&quot;, a duet that he did with Pia Zadora back in 1983/84.  This doesn't take away from the other classics like &quot;Do what you do&quot;, and &quot;Dynamite&quot;.  I seemed to have a few singles of Jermaine's from back in the day, so it's nice to have his songs on CD to enjoy for a long time.  There are other greatest hit collections out there, but I opted for this one because it was released by Arista, which was one of 3 labels that Jermaine was signed with.  It sounds clear &amp; clean, not screechy like some other older recordings converted to CD do.  If you like some great r&amp;b, then Jermaine Jackson's &quot;Heritage Collection&quot; will hit the spot+music
The new sony is very poor quality+N+I bought this never having problems from Amazon.com before.  They did not state that this was a Sony product and when I received it, all the CD had on it was a root kit virus.  It would not even play in my CD player.  When I tried to read the CD to copy and burn the "WAV" files to a new CD so I could just listen to the music, all there were on the CD was executables and no sound files.  Sony is very poor quality now and I do not want to buy it again+music
probably the best collection of fiddle artists in the world+P+it's hard to imagine getting all these artists to perform on one single recording of this magnitude. my hat goes off to mark for this extremly important work of ar+music
A wonderfully innovative and orginal CD+P+I was downloading some shows when I came across a show by some band called  Galactic. I liked it but didn't think much about it. Then last week I saw  Counting Crows and LIVE in concert. When I got there, there was this band  jamming out. I saw the second half of their set, all the time wondering  &quot;who are these guys?&quot; Then they announced that they were  Galactic. The next day I went and bought this CD and I could not be  happier. The blend of funky blues-like singing, jazzy horn play, and the  rock guitar riffs is awesome. This band reminds me very much of a jazz trio  called Medeski, Martin, and Wood. However, Galactic offers great singing  and horns giving them a much more diverse sound. For me, this is one of  those CD's that I don't know any of the song titles because whenever I  listen to it, I listen to the whole thing straight. If you like jazz and  you like jam bands, get this album+music
NO WORDS !+N+ITEM NEVER RECEIVED. IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTACT BY EMAIL THE CUSTOMER SERVICE. MY LAST PURCHASE ON AMAZON +music
Because the Night+P+Great song. I love Patti Smith's version but this one's even better. That song alone is worth however much you pay for this album. Plus you get other rare gems (and great Bruce songs) such as Fire, Seeds and Paradise by the "C" (great title!), not to mention killer versions of Bruce classics such as Rosalita, Born to Run, Thunder Road, Badlands, Darkness on the Edge of Town, The River, Independence Day, etc. Whether you're a completist or a huge fan of The Boss (I fall in the latter camp), you really should pick this up.+music
great, but not quite what expected+P+this  makes awesome workout (elliptical, running, treadmill) music for interval training; wonderfully paced..... can just SEE a Martha Graham choreo. to it while you work out+music
surprisingly good for a hit single+P+I got this album because it was recommended to me by Amazon.com's computerized recommendations system. Being adventurous, I bought it on a whim. I was very pleasantly surprised! Unlike many other popular trance anthems with female vocals, this one is not at all cheesy or monotonous. All of the tracks feature high-quality production and skillful mixing: no amateurish boom-tss filler anywhere on this single. Mavie Marcos has a gorgeously supple voice (reminds me of Kirsty Hawkshaw) and nice pronunciation (I know that it's not politically correct to say this, but it bugs me when the vocalist sounds like a chavette who has gone through accent-reduction training). I highly recommend this CD to anyone who has good taste! Even IDM snobs will appreciate the intricate layering of sound in these tracks+music
Don't believe the snipes, it's their best+P+Yes, I was once like you.  Enraptured by XTC's more lush productions like Skylarking.  But maturity encouraged me to pay closer attention to GO 2 and it has proven to be their finest hour.  Pure, raw, creative energy captured on tape.  This is what Andy and Colin are capable of when not distracted by their more Beatlesque leanings.  There are lots of good tunes on the later albums, of course.  Drums and Wires and English Settlement are personal favorites.  But XTC never exploded with this level of combustion again+music
The best thing they did+P+Does &quot;XTC&quot; mean &quot;mannered, pretentious, overworked drivel&quot; to you? Well, then. Twenty years and more since I first heard them, I think that this is their best album, with Drums and Wires a close second. By Black Sea they were sinking into the Sergeant Pepperization process that would reduce those countless later albums to meaninglessness. This is raw, vital rock music, wonderfully edgy and surprising, from a time in the band's history when they were effortlessly creative, instead of belaboring us, as the Rev. Partridge eventually ended up doing, with their attempts to Have Something To Say+music
I feel embarassed for Steve Albini when I listen to this.+N+This is one of the worst, not to mention most downright annoying albums to come out in recent memory.  Anyone who claims to like this overrated insult to underground music is just trying to sound cool, and failing miserably.  In fact, I'll go out on a limb here and say that anyone who says they like this album hasn't even heard the damn thing, and probably just saw it on a pitchfork list somewhere - and if pitchfork says it's good, it must be good, right?  Wrong.  This album sucks.  It's sad to see people so desperate for indie cred (which, I hate to break it to you, isn't that cool either) that they degrade themselves by publicly admitting they enjoy this album.  However, I would recommend this album to anyone who enjoys hearing Steve Albini ramble on like a douche, with mediocore music being played in the background.  Everyone else, save yourself the trouble and the $10+music
The world's greatest banjo player+P+When Harry Reser wasn't leading the two best hot white jazz bands of the 1920's, the Six Jumping Jacks and the Clicquot Club eskimos, he was making these incredible banjo recordings. Think of Harry Reser as the Les Paul of the 1920's. His fingers were the fastest in the world and his technique was jaw dropping. He seems to playing chords and picking at the same time or is he playing two banjos at once? This particular album will appeal more to guitarists and musicians than to those seeking twenties pop music. For those, grab the other Harry Reser albums on Amazon+music
Excellent performance practice, Complete recording+P+This recording of Messiah is an attempt at using period instruments (either authentic or replicas from the Baroque period) and performing it in the correct manner of "Baroque performance" (at least as best as we can know).  Clearly there are many difficulties in trying to accurately pull this off, but the result does seem to be very Baroque.    Reviewers have two main objections, which the prospective listener should keep in mind.  Many Messiah fans are used to "un-Baroque" performances of Messiah--a 100+ member chorus singing with a full tone, a large orchestra, large dynamic contrasts, and slower tempos.  When people accustomed to such performances hear Hogwood's recording, it is often labeled as "dry," "unemotional," or "light."    Other reviewers object to the quality of the performance itself.  I think that the soloists could do a better job.  The bass is strong, but he could be better, and I think there should be more ornamentation overall.  I personally like the sound of boys singing instead of adult women in the choir, but others may differ.  Other Baroque recordings such as Gardiner, McGegan, or Harnoncourt are also good period recordings.  If you want more traditional interpretations, take a look at Thomas Beecham's or Robert Shaw's recordings.  If you're looking for a complete, scholarly interpretation, however, I think this is a great recording.  Oh, and the accompanying booklet is great, too--very thorough.+music
Beautiful Album+P+Beautiful music and a nice variety, what you would expect from Windhill.  The only flaw, tracks five and six are switched from the list on the album cover; #5 is &quot;First Noel&quot; and #6 is &quot;Christmas Is Coming&quot;.  Highly recommended+music
Not Suitable For Any Living Creature....+N+Pure pretention.  Anyone really interested in true post-modern art can find more compelling works elsewhere.  Minus 5 stars. +music
i love ricky's country but his bluesgrass rules+P+this is one of those bluegrass albums. you cant be without, i love everysong from this album not a bad one at all. bluegrass albums are my favorites by him i was raised on bluegrass music. and i know alot about ricky skaggs, from my dad who is also a mandolin picker and singer and he had the great joy of meeting ricky's sister at a studio once... would love to meet the man himself someday if your a bluesgrass or a rickyskaggs fan then get the album you'll be glad you did+music
dreamy surf island music+P+I love this album!  It takes me back to the islands, basking in the sun, sipping a mai tai, w/ some local cats playing under the palapa.  I'm a big fan of the Aqua Velvets, and Miles playing is stunninly gorgeous on this cd  as well+music
Review of Live Show from Wayne's Tulsa Tour+P+I saw a great show at Fishlips in Bakersfield last Wednesday: Wayne "The Train" Hancock. He sang like a modern-day Hank Williams, and had a great band, just Jake on stand up bass, and Johnny on the Telecaster. Wayne just strummed an acoustic guitar, one stroke per beat, but was always right in the pocket, his guitar was holding down the tempo while the electric guitar filled in when he wasn't singing, and the bass just kept the beat going like crazy. It is a testament to the trio's chops that they could inspire someone to dance right from the first song. They had a really crazy rhythm going and it never let up. And there was not even a drummer in the band. The bass player was always pushing the beat, but with perfect placement, and intonation, which ain't that easy on a fretless stand up bass.  Wayne played for about 2 hours, and he let his girlfriend Gina play a few songs while he took a break. I took that opportunity to get Wayne's autograph. When he got back on stage he sang and talked about all the counties where he was incarcerated. Quite a few.  I loved the show, it was a prodigious display of musical virtuosity. If you closed your eyes you could have sworn it was Hank Williams, yet he had his own style, and wasn't just a clone of Hank. He was what Hank would sound like if he were alive and just a little bit older than Hank Williams III, his grandson is right now.   The songs on Tulsa are great, and whether he is live or in the studio, he sounds fantastic. Wayne Hancock refuses to compromise his music, to sweeten it, to make it more commercial, to do anything other than play music he really feels deep down inside, and to make you feel it deep down inside, too. +music
Great CD+P+Along with the one song I've been looking for, this has a lot of great songs+music
One Hour of Hip Hop Scratchology..+P+Clocking in at a little less than 60 Minutes, 'Scratchology' will definately take you through the study of Scratching importance in Hip Hop history. The next time you're thinking of taking a drive or a walk, pop this CD in your player and let it ride, because it will definately take you down memory lane with flavor added by The X-Ecutioners+music
Fans Only+N+Censored &quot;bits&quot; of Lenny Bruce.  His earliest work, but not nearly as great as he was to become.  Has some great stuff but not really his best work. Get a live performance for the real reason people love  Lenny+music
Try Ultra Dance 2, it's much better.+N+I bought this CD based on the fact that I liked Ultra Dance 2.  I thought the third one would be another good CD to listen to for the summer.  I was disappointed when I got my CDs and listened to them.  The mixes on these songs are terrible, with the exception of two tracks.  On the other hand, Ultra Dance 2, which is mixed by DJ Encore, is much better in comparison.  Although the songs on Ultra Dance 2 are last year songs, it is worth more than this one.  Trust me, you are not missing anything+music
Received album today :)+N+OK. I just got this CD today, and now i'm happy. Was late, but only got this album for "good morning beautiful"+music
Can't put it down+P+As another reviewer said. This may be the easiest CD to wear out in 10 days+music
It's never quite let me go.+P+At a rather hip friend's insistence, I first heard this album in mid to late high school (circa 1995).  Seeing as that those years were ground zero for teenage angst and all that comes with being hormonal, confused, and lovelorn, I seized onto this band with a fervor (right along with Mineral, Seam, and a few others).  To this day, when I hear the opening bass chords and the swelling drums of the first song, I instinctively grit my teeth, get my rock face on, and prepare to air drum on my steering wheel.  This is a powerful record, one that bends and weaves with a beautiful intensity throughout.  The desperation of hardcore is still very much a presence in TITR's music, but it's bound tight with melody, memorable time signatures, and pop-savvy structures.  Granted, Garrett's voice can drive people away from the band if they aren't willing to give it time (he's more than a tad nasal), but the songs stick with you. Definitely an album to purchase if you're even momentarily interested in the mid-'90's tail end of the "emo/post hardcore" movement. As for the guy who suggested that the EP was better than this full-length, don't believe it.  Get this, and dig in+music
Where's the Beef?+N+In the 70's there was American  British and Canadian rock. Its a shame that most living outside of Canada didn't get an opportunity to hear a lot more of the Canadian product. My biggest beef with all of the April Wine "greatest hits" compilations was the fact that most of the rocking early years has been largely ignored. Who put these compilations together? Where was lead singer/songwriter/guitarist Myles Goodwyn during all of this? Where is "Fast Train, Bad Side of the Moon, Drop Your Guns, Electric Jewels, Weeping Widow, Just Like That, You Could Have Been a Lady, Anything You Want, Victim for Your Love, Forever for Now, Cat's Claw, Come on Along, The Band Has Just Begun" etc etc etc? The albums "Electric Jewels, On Record and Stand Back" as well as "Live at the El Mocambo" are much more representative of April Wine. Canada rocked, we really did. You just wouldn't know it from this pap.+music
Pretty weak stuff+N+I have to admit that I had not really listened to Mika before I saw him in concert in Stockholm. He does what he does reasonably well for this genre. Good falsetto voice although it gets a bit loud and annoying during the show. Here is what made me lose all respect for this artist. During his show in Stockholm he only played for 60 minutes, including an encore. I am sorry, but no artist worth anything would walk away only playing 60 minutes. Overall I would say ok voice, pretty weak songwriting, and pathetic live show. I lost what little respect I gained for Mika during the first few songs. Weak, weak, weak.+music
If it was possible to give 0 stars, I would have+N+This CD is just plain horrible.  It lacks in real talent and it is as cliche as you can get.  Hey, The Grateful Dead was a good band, but new hippie-wanna-be bands just don't have the talent.  The only people who buy  these albums are just 14 year old freshmen in High School looking for an  excuse to be &quot;popular.&quot;  Well, my bashing has been done, so I  will leave you on this note;  If you hear twinkle-twinkle-little-star music  once, doesn't it just get plain boring+music
No More Vocals Please !!!!!!!!!!!+N+I Purchased the Winter Solstice Vol #3 thinking that it would be as good as the rest,was I disappointed. Tracks 5,6,7,10,11.13 are atrocious,the rest of the tracks are good.I cant get to my CD player fast enough to skip over them when they start playing.I now sample every song on the CDs and dont take for granted that all Winter Solstices are created equal.People,please start giving honest reviews and stop the false advertisement+music
Shake your booty.......+P+I noticed this CD because of the name of the band and the suggestions from other Amazon customers. I must say it is one of my favorite CD's! The songs have great rythmn and the energy of the artists translate beautifully even though I don't speak Spanish or Japanese(one of my favorite songs!)Everyone-aged from 17 to 83 that has heard this CD, will request me to play it when they visit. Pepe's voice reminds me so much of Ricky Ricardo, that I'm surprised the album isn't called "Latenight Lucy"!! Can't wait for the release of their next CD.  +music
One Good Number+N+I heard "Heart of Mine" in the closing credits for the movie Runaway Jury.  After listening to the album, I found that was really the only tune I liked.  Peter Malick is a veteran of the hard-charging James Montomery Band (who I have seen tear up stages of Northeast blues clubs), which is why the sleepiness of most of these pieces mystifies me.  You could argue that he is going for a "relaxed" feel, to which I would repsond he succeeds all too well.  Norah Jones can sing, and sing well- no argument there, but these songs are not great.  The lyrics I found to be a little too clever, like some music student's term paper.  For most of the album I felt like everyone was trying way too hard to do something deep and meaningful.  Having said all this, "Heart of Mine" is an excellent record, and might even be worth the price of the CD.  Of course, to get the one good track, you could try downloading it for a dollar from itunes or your favorite MP3 site.+music
Good first effort, but get the later stuff+N+Jill Sobule really hit it big with her first hit &quot;I Kissed a Girl&quot;, which is on her second self-titled album &quot;Jill Sobule&quot;.  This first album  isn't really all that good; like she was  still finding herself.  For a better album, check out her &quot;Jill  Sobule&quot; album or even better &quot;Happy Town&quot;+music
one of the greatest early British hard rock albums+P+This album deserves to be (at least) as popular as Led Zeppelin's first two albums or Deep Purple's "In Rock" and "Machinehead" albums. Simply great. And by the way, you should check out Ten Years After's "A Space in Time" too. The high point of the album, which includes many fine tracks, is "Come Together in the Morning". And the original version of "Wishing Well" is so much more powerful than the better-known version by Gary Moore, which just doesn't do the song justice. While many reviewers rave about Paul Kossoff's guitar work, I think this album is a real showcase for Paul Rodgers, one of rock music's greatest singers+music
I'm sad to say....but I am dissapointed+N+I know that this review will be followed by several saying that I am stupid and am not aware of how awesome Shadows Fall is, but I still think it is worthwhile to let other people know my opinion. I was excited for this album, Shadows Fall shows so much potential at times but this release is such a disappointment. While it isn't terrible, it just is not good. It suffers the pitfall of many metal releases, all the songs follow identical formats and never keep your interest. If you don't believe me, scan through this CD and let me know if almost all (with the exception of one or two) aren't : a kind of cool guitar intro that might lead to something cool, then drums come in with the same predictable snare on every beat,and then mediocre vocals singing some of the most lackluster vocal in recent memory.  Don't buy this album looking for some sort of blistering heavy metal experience. Don't buy this album if you want something you may replay again. If you want to buy a mediocre heavy metal album then I guess you should buy this album, but I say take a stand. Don't just buy whatever Shadows Fall puts out in front of you. The War Within was a good CD. The follow up bonus track CD was just a desperate attempt to make more money with nothing new and this CD is just a group that didn't really try and put out some music.  I'm sorry to all the die hard Shadows Fall fans, and you may enjoy this album which is great for you, but I really felt like Shadows Fall underachieved and didn't really put enough into this release. I know they could have done better+music
Could be better+N+I bought this to assist my recovery from a long bout with Lyme disease.  I found it minimally useful.  It is relaxing, but I was hoping some more creative visualizations directed toward healing one's body.  Perhaps it is intended to heal the soul, which may ultimately heal the body, but I was disappointed+music
pure jazz+P+I was hapy to receive this cd and almost all of the songs play correctly but the last two songs will not play unless you do it manually. I Have a High end Harmon Kardon System so that is not why. I cleaned the disc but still no straight playthrough.   My wife is p'od since she doesn't know how to manually start these two songs. +music
we get it already+N+If you wish to learn something interesting re the fact that the keys of b minor and Bb major share the note D as their third, you would do far better to consult a decent recording of Beethoven's Hammerklavier Sonata than this navel-gazing narcissistic atrocity+music
Very unhappy with this purchase+N+THIS SHOULD PROBABLY GO TO CUSTOMER SERVICE, BUT YOUR RETURN POLICY SAYS YOU CAN'T RETURN OPENED CDs so if I can't return it, perhaps others can learn from this what can happen when you order online. I thought I was getting the whole CD and when I opened it and put it on, it turned out to have the song Not Ready to Make Nice, one other song and then some video of Not Ready to Make Nice. I checked with a friend who has the album and she said there should be lots of other songs on it. Can you send me the album I thought I was buying+music
The Brotha Is Back+P+Get this cd! The entire cd is a joyous experience. This is R&B Soul at it's best......+music
average+N+I was hyped about them coming back after they rocked on DJ Quik's Rhythmalism.that album was slammin'but this disc is about 5 years past the pull date on style.Up 'N Da CLub is tight.straight up DJ Quik is a Musical  Genius.but he can't pull this disc off Properly.AMG is banging on the track  but overall it's missing something+music
disappointingly cliche and boring+N+Unfortunately, perhaps, I am a performing musician (voice, keyboards, flute, guitar, and a smathering of other instruments)as well as a composer, and also a fan of fresh, innovative treatments of familiar tunes. I search out and buy two or three new Christmas CD's each year and listen to them non-stop for the month of December. I had great hopes that this Liebert CD would be inspiring and was disappointed that it was the opposite. Each tune follows the formula of the rhythm section playing a straight-ahead version of whatever song with Liebert playing a totally traditional, single-note melody on top, often co-mingled with a couple of motifs from another Christmas song. The rhythm section plays the same traditional chord progressions again while Liebert &quot;jams,&quot; using the same trite, tired riffs. BORING+music
Yeah...I'm gonna have to go ahead and disagree.+N+Admittedly, I don't scour the surface of the Earth for hard to find B, C, and D-class tracks to add to my metal collection. If you do, you may agree with the novelist who wrote the first review on this set. As for me, this is one of those items that you just have to admit to yourself was a mistake and file it with sanitation engineering. Luckily, I got mine on clearance+music
Great Music, horrible mastering+N+One of the best pieces of rock ever recorded, one of the worst reissue I ever heard. Do not buy this Japanese import! If you know what this album is suppose to sound like then you will want to cry when you hear Sony's butchering of this reissue. I am not being over critical here, this mix will make you cringe, or maybe we are just getting spoiled by Rhino's superb job? It's a cryin sham+music
Good but Not Great+P+The music set to Midsummer Night's Dream arranged here by Boswell yields good things but is not entirely great. For instance, since the movie had the story set in Tuscany, Italy, there are a lot of  songs of the opera, since opera was founded in Italy and it makes one feel more at home with the movie location. Also, Intermezzo from Cavalleria Rusticana, an opera intermission music by Mascagni, is heard here. I think these things are all out of place. There should be more emphasis on the music of Shakespeare's time- oboe, flute and Renaissance instruments. The soundtrack to &quot;Much Ado About Nothing &quot; is even better since it does manage to remain Shakespearian. But otherwise this music is beautiful, especially the Midsummer Night's Dream Music by Mendelsshon -the Overture is a delightful, sunny piece to hear and then there is the famous signature Wedding March. I recommend anyone to get the entire classical work- the Scherzo is just as good and other selections. This cd is good but not great. In opera, it has featured its brightest stars- Fleming, Domingo and Bartoli. But a great cd nonetheless+music
GREAT DISC+P+Byrd&amp;Burrell really stand out here.The Music here is very essential to the ear.Donald Byrd has Been Bad for SO Long that it's Amazing at his Depth&amp;Talent.The Music Here is in a Class all onto it's own.A Must have  from Two Legends.The Arrangements&amp;Productions are tight+music
Essential Beach Boys+P+If you're looking for a collection of just the hits, stick with 2003's SOUNDS OF SUMMER. If you need a nostalgia fix for the Beach Boys' best albums of the Sixties through the mid-Seventies, pick up the two-fers of their classic albums from SURFIN' SAFARI through SURF'S UP. However, if you want a solid overview of America's most influential band and why Brian Wilson is regarded as a genius, wrap your ears around this 5-disc GOOD VIBRATIONS box set. Brian Wilson and company take you on a  magical history tour from their debut single "Surfin'" to their final No. 1, "Kokomo." ESSENTIA+music
Ego trip+N+Save your money and buy something else. The Dylan performances are few and uninspired. The rest -- peformances of Dylan -- are sometimes good, sometimes amusing, sometimes odd, but don't amount to much as a collection. I wanted to see the movie until I heard the soundtrack+music
Best soul in ages.+P+This album blew me away from the moment I heard it. The only downside is there are not many songs with vocals on the album. If you like old funk or soul then this album is for you. These guys will leave footprints in the history books of this genre+music
One of the best albums of the year..+P+This new album by former Mr.Big guitar player Paul  Gilbert is a nice surprise! Beatle-esque melodies coupled with good leading and backing vocals, not forgetting the intrincate, fast melodic guitar riffs and chops  make this a delicious CD. Highlights include the first track &quot;Get  It&quot; with its infectious theme and the ballad &quot;Kate is a  Star&quot;. Listen to flying dog and have a good time+music
CD quality is the problem, not the music+N+I have purchased (and returned) four, count 'em, four Green Mile soundtrack CD's because of numerous skips. I keep going back, hoping the problem has been fixed, but no luck. I wrote Warner Brothers about this and I have not received a response to date. Has anyone else run into this frustrating problem+music
An eclectic approach+P+Satch is full of surprises. Thats the very reason he still has such a strong fan following and keeps getting more popular. In this album he made the right decision by brining in Nathan East, Manu Katche and Andy Fairweather Low as his studio musicians. The virtuosity of every musician on this album is astronomical. Songs like If, Cool no9, down down down, etc are the Satriani you never have heard of before.+music
Astounding album from the brilliant Chris De Burgh+P+Throughout his musical career, Chris De Burgh has offered albums filled with beautiful, creative and imaginative songs.  The Storyman carries this idea to its zenith with a collection of incredible tracks.  "One World" is the perfect expression of spiritual and secular equality.  Performed and sung beautifully, it is one of De Burgh's finest moments.  The heart wrenching "The Shadow Of The Mountain" and uplifting "Raging Storm" are both utterly beautiful.  "The Sweetest Kiss Of All" is a touching love song with a fantastic melody.  "The Mirror Of The Soul" is classic storytelling in musical form while "The Storyman" is a synopsis of all that is De Burgh and his career in one song.  The album, as a collection, is complete, cohesive and well recorded.  Each track stands as an example of the best in songwriting from practically any artist in popular music.    I am personally devastated by the power and beauty of this album.  Chris De Burgh has impressed me once again.  It's an incredible musical accomplishment+music
A great classic Chris De Burgh album+P+After listening to &quot;Into the Light&quot; and &quot;flying Colours&quot;, I began a search for more music by Chris De Burgh. Although the music differs somewhat in sound from his newer albums, from the moment  I heard Hold On I knew I would enjoy this album. My favorite is probably  Windy Night. But all of them are good respectively. I must say I found it  interesting how he was able to blend alittle of each song on the album onto  the lyrics of the end song, Goodnight. I also can't help but wonder if a  lyric from Satin Green Shutters didn't inspire a later song of his,  Forevermore. Whatever the case this is a wonderful piece for any true CDB  fa+music
Fast and Cheap!+P+This item was delivered quickly (in time for Christmas) and cost me a lot less than buying it at any music store+music
Why is everything geared to helping your kid &quot;compete&quot;?+N+Classical music is beautiful and rewarding.  Can't it be rewarding on its own terms, rather than as a &quot;fast track&quot; to the Ivy League and financial success?  When I was a child, my parents played classical music  for us because they loved it, and they hoped we would, too.  I do the same  for my own kids.  But my siblings didn't much like classical music, and  despite the insulting and ludicrous claims made on this CD, their SAT  scores were in line with my own. I think that if Beethoven or Mozart knew  that their beautiful, timeless music was being cheapened into just another  &quot;get ahead quick&quot; scam, they'd roll over in their graves+music
Harry's trumpet+P+Harry was one of the great trumpters.  It was a pleasure to listen to his best works again+music
Indie popsters find niche in familiar post punk guitar pop+P+The Stills are a Montreal indie rock band who write expertly woven melodies crafted in the familiar niche of swirly-80s-post-punksters like Echo & The Bunnymen or The Church, but add a unique neo-vibe which finds them comfortable next to say, Interpol or Bloc Party.  This is their best release by far, every song heart-wrenchingly wrought forward with layered guitars and superb lyrics.  If you like a comfortable mix of brit pop influence, a dash of romanticism and depression, finely crafted into guitar heavy pulsating riffs, then this is for you!  Fans of The Walkmen rejoice--this is the better purchase of the two~this LP is packed full of college radio singles, including "Gender Bombs" and "Changes Are No Good.+music
disappointment+N+Sorry but this didn't cut it for me.  It sounded more like a amateur rehersal tape than what i expect from the Beach Boys+music
Fave Jazz Album!+P+Every tune is fab! Thankfully, the remastering has not diminished the old scratchy sound typically found in recordings from this era.  This is why I hate most modern jazz. This has genuine feeling, a raw sound, natural flow, and catchy licks--things lacking these days, IMO.   Pick this up if you are not a huge jazz collector, but just wish to add something worthwile to your otherwise ecclectic collection of music+music
It Took Me 4 Months To Buy....Now I Know Why+N+Although this album is a bit more insightful and less materialistic than his previous work, with the exception of BluePrint which is a classic and in a class of its own, I wasn't so anxious about him coming back or this album in general. He should've retired after Blueprint if he wanted to do it while he was ontop. The Black Album was alot better than the BluePrint2 which was one disc so-so to good and second disc made of 90% filler.  While this album shows a more storytelling, poet side of Jay-Z, it ain't exactly his best work. Actually this falls down at the bottom, right beneath his 1997 Vol 1 album. While his maturity as an artist has improved, his lyrical content has suffered. The first 5 songs are classic Jay-Z and the last two songs are classic hip-hop but the rest of the album in between sound more like demos of MC such&such. In my opinion, he has faltered quite a bit on this album, this is right under BluePrint2; BluePrint2 should've never been two discs let alone be a sequel to a hip-hop classic. Kingdom Come has a few good moments starting with the intro and leaving at Lost One, then coming back with Minority Report and ending altogether with Beach Chair, which could've had a better song title given the point of the song. Beyonce, Usher & Ne-Yo, John Legend and Chrisete could've been more utilized than singing hooks, let alone singing hooks on so-so songs. More thought could've been put into the album to make it a 3, and more could've been covered to make it a 4. But Jay is starting to let his Def Jam position affect him.+music
O Brother Bruce, Where Art Thou?+N+There are two stellar tracks on this: &quot;McCarran Airport," sounding like a lost Jimmy Webb classic, and the wistfully gorgeous &quot;Spring Time.&quot; A quick look at the credits show they're the only two from the pen of brother Bruce. As for the rest -- think Kenny G meets H/D/H. Sadly, that stands for Hallmark/Doggerel/Hallmark. And that's too bad, as the vocals and sparse arrangements are right on the money. If there's to be a follow-up, give Bruce free reign+music
Watch out! Not the originals+N+This album features 70s re-recordings of ET's hits. His Texas Troubodors at the time were a good band, but Ernest's voice had coarsened quite a bit by then. You can now get the original 40s and 50s recordings of Ernest's  hits on the Hall of Fame series. Even the 1958 remakes originally on the  Decca/MCA &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; and &quot;Ernest Tubb Story&quot; were  pretty good...but this album is for completists only+music
Rhythmic and Passionate+P+This album's music is well arranged, with a seductive blend of Spanish guitar and violin.  I've enjoyed every track, and have recommended his music to my music loving friends!!+music
Omglolz, he said "boobies."+N+What's wrong with BHG? Besides everything? Is it possible for them to write more than one good song in their pathetic lives? My sister burned this CD from a friend, most likely because she likes the Bad Touch song, and I'VE been the one having to hear it in the morning when she's getting ready for school. It's pathetic. I don't know how much I can stress the word "pathetic", but it's the only way to fully describe it. Out of 18 tracks, there's one, count it, ONE good song, "The Inevitable Return of The Great White Dope", because it's nothing like their other songs. Everything else on this album is just like "Fire Water Burn", "The Bad Touch", "Hell Yeah", you get the picture. Palm-muted, droning, songs with extremely explicit lyrics, which is the only reason people will remember them. Isn't it about time to come out of the 13-16 year old stage? Having lyrics about sex won't get you any. Bands like Blink-182, Sum 41, and System of a Down have funny songs, but they have their limits. About the "music": 1)Palm-muting doesn't make a song good. I get it. You can palm-mute. So can most people who play guitar or bass. 2)Make your music more diverse and varied, or at least change your patterns. Elastica's self-titled album has 4-chord patterns, except they play faster, and the songs aren't much longer than two and a half minutes long (not that I'm comparing BHG to Elastica). 3)Do what you do "best", and don't try metal. "Magna Cum Nada" is BHG's horrible attempt to make something metal-ish. Stop. The problem with Bloodhound Gang is that they just won't die. People like them somehow, and so they feel compelled to squeeze out more and more crap that gets worse and worse as it progresses, not saying that they were ever good.  Why don't we go through the songs and rate them, shall we?  1. I Hope You Die: See track 15 2. The Inevitable Return of The Great White Dope: Best song by BHG, but still not great. 3. Mama's Boy: See track 15 4. Three Point One Four: See track 15 5. Mope: See track 15 6. Yummy Down On This: See track 15  Catch my drift yet? I don't think I can fully show my displeasure with words. "1 star , because 0 is not an option" is exactly correct.  People, if you actually want Bloodhound Gang, copy it from someone. Maybe if they see their record sales go down, they'll actually think about quitting.  p.s. Track 15 is called "This is Stupid.+music
Wow! This is really GOOD stuff!+P+Winterheart's Guild(2003). Sonata Arctica's third studio album.  Unlike most people on this site apparently, I DON'T hate power metal. I'm not one who slags the whole genre off upon the discovery of other music like progressive rock and other styles like a lot of people do. When I first came across the genre years ago, I was in heaven. There were a lot of really cool albums by bands like Stratovarius, Labyrinth, Dream Evil, Blind Guardian, Primal Fear, Hammerfall, and others that brought forth the nostalgic sounds of some of my favorite 80s metal bands, though with the benefit of modern production technology. Sure, the subject matter among many of these bands can come across as goofy (almost bearing a Manowar quality at times), but most people seem to miss the point that none of it is meant to be taken seriously.  Of course, my interest in Power Metal has waned since then, but only because after a while, most of the bands I came across started to sound a lot alike with very little to separate them apart from others and make me want to come back for more. It seemed like all the bands had the same machine-gun double bass drumming, Malmsteen-inspired guitar solos, harpsichord keyboard soloing, and Geoff Tate-inspired singing. In short, I needed more _variety_.  Thankfully, bands like Sonata Arctica, Kamelot, and Nightwish are around to show the rest how to make a good, memorable band.  To me, Sonata Arctica sounds like a bigger, better, more realized Stratovarius. I'd known about the band for a while, and I've always loved the song 'Power Of One' off of Silence(2001) which was my first introduction to them. I finally saw one of their albums in the store the other day, and since I'm always looking for good music, I figured "why not?". After listening to this album several times now, I can honestly say that this was one of the best purchases I've made all year. While I do like Stratovarius, the problem I had with them is that their albums would have a couple of really outstanding songs on them, followed by several by-the-numbers tracks which they've formulated to death over and over again. Sonata Arctica has no problems like this. This band takes Stratovarius's sound as a main template, and infuses their own creative songwriting melodies and lyrical topics into it, creating a very memorable and varitable collection of songs. Their singer has that familiar Finnish accent, though it's combined with a real passionate performance. The guitarist always seems to play the right riff at the right time, varying it up from soulfull crunchy riffs to great solos that bring Glen Tipton of Judas Priest to mind. Keyboards go from solo-esque battles to goosebump-inducing atmospheric passages that compliment the melodies.  Picking out favorite tracks on this album is a very difficult thing to do, but the ones that seem to stand out the most are 'APBE', 'Gravenimage', 'The Cage', 'Silver Tongue', 'Champaign Bath', and 'Broken'. 'APBE' and 'The Cage' are two of the fast speed metal tracks, while 'Gravenimage' and 'Broken' both sport unique, melodic overtones to them. 'Champaign Bath' is fast, fun metal that takes you for a hellova ride. Then there's two nice ballads to top the album off: 'The Misery' and 'Draw Me'. These ballads thankfully aren't syrup-drenched like a lot of ballads can get. There aren't any bad tracks in the bunch, and there's something to please anyone that is looking for variety.  Replayability: High. Makes for a perfect power metal fix.  WG proved to be a great starting point for me, and I highly suggest anyone else who sees this album in the stores to give it a shot. They also have a new album out, Reckoning Night(2005) as well as two earlier albums, Ecliptica(1999) and Silence, which many consider their best work. If WG is any indication, then I can't wait any longer to hit up on the other albums. One of the lyrics in the song 'Gravenimage' asks "Can I still recognize a beautiful melody?". Yes, you certainly can, and you're certainly one of the best bands in the business at it.   Other recommendations: -Any other Sonata Arctica album. ALL are outstanding. (judging by the soundclips) -'Visions' by Stratovarius -'Epica' and 'The Black Halo' by Kamelot -'Oceanborne', 'Wishmaster', and 'Century Child' by Nightwis+music
no,no,no,no,no+N+I hate this band.THEY WERE THE LEAST RESPECTED GROUP IN THE 70'S.THE ONLY GROUP WHICH MATTERED IN THE 1970'S WAS PINK FLOYD.I JUST CANT UNDERSTAND THAT WHY IN 2006 WOULD PEOPLE WANT TO LISTEN TO THESE TALENTESS DI**HEADS WHEN THERE IS SO MUCH BETTER MUSIC AVAILABLE THAN THIS.GET PEARL JAM'S SELF TITLED ALBUM INSTEAD.BUY THIS STUPID ALBUM IF YOU ARE STILL LIVING IN 1970'S.ZERO STAR+music
A snoozer ...+N+I loved "Come Away With Me" the first moment I heard it.  I also had the opportunity to see Norah and her wonderful band in concert ... the experience was absolutely FANTASTIC! I couldn't have asked for a better! So naturally I waited in eager anticipation for her new album "Feels Like Home" which after only one listen made me feel narcoleptic.  It was a good thing I didn't try and listen to it while driving.  To be perfectly honest, I haven't listened to it since. She is so talented, I wish this effort had been as successful as the first, but not everyone hits a homerun each time at bat. But I still hold out hope that her next album will be better+music
Incredible Texas Music Album+P+This is without a doubt the best texas music album I've ever heard, and quite possibly my favorite CD I own.  I just don't get tired of it.  There's simply not a weak song on the album, and there's a good variety of upbeat songs as well as slower, more somber ones.  Pick this one up. +music
What am I missing???+N+I hate this CD. I have most of the other Chieftan CD's, and their collaboration with other artists has always worked in the past. This collection runs the gamut from mediocre to ludicrous. To paraphrase a line from Spinal Tap:&quot;There's a fine line between clever and stupid.&quot; This one's over the line.  &quot;Tears of Stone&quot; is my current fave+music
Blackfoot Rattlesnake Rock Bites!+P+I saw them open for KISS in 76 and they blew me away. But for some reason I never bought any albums. I never heard them on the radio. I always thought they were  another Skynrd type band but they are NOT! They are just kick butt rock and roll! I love it! I love the live versions so much I wanna get the live album now. Reminds me of Saxon or UFO live. Awesome. I'm sorry I didn't listen to them before. Train TRain, Wishing Well, Queenie and the kickin' Good Morning are just killers! If you think they are just some southern band think again. Highly recommended for any hard blues rock fan. Buy Blackfoot+music
SWEET shock their fans!+P+The SWEET shock a few of their fans here and jump from bubble-gum to Rock. From the first 30 seconds of track one "Set Me Free" for good or bad, you know those days are gone for ever. In the process they acquire an entirely new audience. The SWEET have attained their adolescence. Although they do not have total control (yet) of the final product, they are now penning many of the songs and are breaking free from the nest. This gives the band new energy and motivation which is evident in the final product. As adolescents, gone is the "goodie two-shoes" image. The topics now range from fast cars (Rebel Rouser) to bi-sexual women (AC-DC). In the 70's the "moral majority" still ruled over freedom of expression, so these subjects are dealt with some subtlety and an occasional bit of humour.  Oh yes the music...I could decipher the music for pages but I'll let YOU do it. Someone once wrote that SWEET was a fly by night, 3 chord churning and "very limited talent wise" band. Alright then "smarty pants", compare Pat Benatar's cover of the song "No You Don't" to the original SWEET version. Compare the drums, guitar and vocals. Then you can make-up your own mind...   GREAT STUFF!!! An excellent deal with all those extra tracks.+music
A Dark Masterpiece!+P+"Berlin",  which was Reed's follow-up to his highly succesful ( both musically and commercially ) 1972 album "Transformer", showcases a radical change in Reed's direction. Whereas "Transformer" was a mostty light and musically catchy album, "Berlin" is a more complex and darker album; both musically and lyrically.   No tracks have the commercial appeal which characterized many tracks on "Transformer", and the album contains no new hit-singles. The album works much better to be listened to as a whole, and only few tracks are suited for "Best of" compilations. Songs like "Caroline Says" and "How Do Think it Feels" would be the most obvious selections to put out. This doesn't mean that this is not good album; on the contrary; it may be his artistically most  successful. Musically it's very varied in style and instrumentation.   The "Berlin" theme seems to have influenced the arrangements of the two opening tracks; especially "Lady Day" ( Kurt Weil ).  The songs are generally longer than on Reed's two previous albums, but you are never bored when listening to the album; and once you have gotten to know the songs, you'll notice that it is really a very melodic album, with no unimportant tracks.  This is Reed's Dark Masterpiece+music
Not What I Expected+N+Gun in hand, formula of flesh and bury me were 3 excellent songs but the rest of the tracks on the album just sounded like filler. not really my kind of stuff i guess+music
LA Hip-Hop Crew Stuck in Second Gear+N+Despite breaking through with the Kanye West-assisted This Way in 2004, Dilated Peoples have created a niche for themselves, devoid of mainstream hip-hop's frills and the eccentric creativity of the left-field. Their once-commendable stoicism now translates as banality, not aided by this lacklustre set, filled with beats that Eminem would be ashamed of. The malaise even extends to some very ordinary scratching from the usually impeccable DJ Babu, while it takes guest Talib Kweli to deliver the LP's best verse on Kindness For Weakness+music
My Favorite Christmas Music+P+I have had this videocassette for years and its so worn I'm so glad to finally get a CD!  Jewel's voice is beautiful and some of the classics like Joy to the World and O Little Town of Bethlehem are the best versions I have ever heard.  I could have done without the non-traditional songs which don't quite fit into the holiday arrangement or match the beauty of her voice but its well worth the purchase for Gloria, O Holy Night and Ave Maria. If you like to sing along, I highly recommend it.+music
Nice Sophmore Effort+P+The Alice Cooper Band's second album sees the band still recording for Frank Zappa's label.  The music starts to turn in the direction of the material that would later make them famous.  No real macabre stuff yet, but the album is definitely a progression from their first one.  The album was produced by David Brigs who is probably best known for working with Neal Young.  The opening track, "Mr. And Misdemeanor" has always been a favorite of mine and a great example of Alice's talent for playing on words.  "Shoe Salesman", "Below Your Means", "Return Of The Spiders", and the short but cool "Refrigerator Heaven" are all good tunes.  The finale of "Beautiful Flyaway" and "Lay Down And Die, Goodbye" is also a great way to end things.  The Alice Cooper band would be signed to Capitol and hit the big time with their next release.  "Easy Action" would be a strong stepping stone to get to that point. +music
Typical excellence+P+If you are looking for a disc with first-rate interpretations of some of the standards in brass band literature, this recording (and its somewhat more refined Volume 1) begs your attention.  All of the performances are extremely clean and precise, and the technical requirements of these works are often extensive.  There are the moments of overly sentimental playing and wobbly vibrato that was so off-putting to Vaughan Williams in his Henry V, but nothing outside of the standard practice in most British Brass Bands. +music
Hit&Miss Set+N+first of All KRS-One is One of the Greatest Rappers&Story-Tellers Ever&Ain't nobody out now in Rap Can even Hold His Shoe Laces when He breaks things down.having said that&understanding He didn't fully want this Album out He still hasn't knocked me out with a Album all the way through in way over a Decade.He has had some tight Jams&of course His Flow still will just leave you dizzy but the Music&Subject matter are pretty much the same&He hasn't challenged His Full powers as a MC in quite some time.He still has the Words&Flow to Roll you over but Albums like this&others of recent time just don't even begin to do this Man Justice when you remember&Grew up on His Best stuff.but regardless I'll always listen to Him.He truly changed&Flipped the Game+music
Beyond belief..........................and stupidity!!+N+First of all, THE DELIVERY MAN isn't that much of an album.  Why would anyone want a bonus disc of bad remixes or live versions???  You folks are right - this reissuing business is just plain stupid.  I've been a Costello fan for over 25 years, but I'll tell you what, my collection stopped at the Ryko reissues!  As for the stuff he's put out since the Universal switch - I've burned them all off the copies that my local library system gets (at least one person on their buying staff is a Costello fan - ain't I lucky?).  Sorry E, but I spent too much of my (and other people's) money on buying these "elusive" rare tracks - that are still in print all these years later.  I'll believe this stuff is rare when Rhino ceases the bonus discs and just reissues the old catalog in their original 11-20 song discs.  In the meantime, I've got a box of old Costello 45s and picture sleeves for sale.  Any takers+music
The Jewel Case has more value than the disc+N+This is the worst lp in recording history.  The covers are embarassingly bad, and especially their cover of Lou Reed's "Sweet Jane" which is down right hideous and I'd be suprised if Lou Reed wouldn't beat the living daylights out of all three of these losers if he ever saw them.  If you think Grand Funk Railroad covering the Stones' "Gimmie Shelter" was ridiculous, that's nothing; this is far, far worse.  As for their big hit single, "Smoking in the Boys' Room" here's a newsflash:IT'S a NOVELTY song, nothing more.  The rest of the songs are "me wanna hump you" caveman songs ineptly play that make Bad Company sound sophisticated.  I'm sorry Cub Koda died young, but there is a silver lining in that cloud: HE'S NOT RECORDING ANYMORE.  Rated 1 Star because ZERO wasn't available.  Avoid at all costs.  Unless you want a ten dollar mini frisbee that comes with a jewel case+music
The puritan sesssions+P+Doesn't get anymore classic than this ! Two legends just sitting down and doing what they do best+music
connection to film The Ice Harvest+P+There is mention of As Wichita Falls, so Falls Wichita Falls in the movie The Ice Harvest...does anyone know if there is definite connection between this album which is much older and the film which played around Christmas 2005? I am not big Metheny fan == was looking for something else when I ran across this album..+music
Really the thing that gets me+P+Really the thing that gets me is not Dolphy's playing at all.  It's Bobby Hutcherson's.  He is a master on this album, proving solo after solo that his taste is something to be reckoned with.  If you are a fan of the vibraphones, and want to hear them used the exact opposite of the way that the Modern Jazz Quartet used them, grab your keys, walk out of your door, lock your door, walk down the path in front of your house, out of your front yard, shutting the small latch on your gate, get in your car and go to a music store.  Once there, head to the jazz section and get this album.  Or, you know, click BUY.  Either way.  It'll work+music
Decyfer Down~End of Grey+N+This band is more punk than rock with only somewhat easy flowing songs+music
G&D gone pop =(+N+Wow! What a horrible album! Its tracks are filled with a bunch of predictable outcomes and very cheesy vocals. The only two tunes that I have found to be interesting were Eleven and Sydney. Eleven is actually my favourite tune. Gabriel & Dresden had the potential as they made some quality productions - although most of them were a bit too commercial, but still quility - throughout years 2002-2004. Then they released the awesome, their best in my opinion, track Arcadia. After the release of Arcadia, I just thought it couldn't get better than this - an awsome production without any of that cheesiness that you would find in their earlier works. But the reality was that from that point on it just went downhill for these two. And this album just proves it. All of these tracks are well done and finished, but too finished and too uncreative. It actually didn't surprise me after hearing their Essential Mix back in spring. Basically they have great production skills but absolutely no ideas. I would recommend just buying track Eleven on 12" or mp3+music
John brings new light to his new songs...+P+I've always loved the way John Mayer takes his songs to the acoustic side of things and this album highlights that talent. The songs have a different feel to them. They don't sound as deep and emotional as the full orchestrated Continuum versions, but (with the exception of Waiting on the world to Change - which sounds identical to the Continuum version) both Belief and Slow Dancing (the two strongest on this album) have a more personal sound to them.  The production is spotless and it sounds as though the album was recorded in the studio as opposed to live, and result is a definite additon to your John Mayer collection.  The only fault I have is that there isn't a longer track listing+music
best COB album+P+8 years later and this album still rules. this is by far the best children of bodom album and hatebreeder comes in second with tokyo warhearts. don't waste your time with new bodom if you haven't heard the older stuff yet especially something wild because you will be missing out on what COB really are. Deadnight Warrior and Touch Like (the) Angel of Death amazing+music
Solid DIsc+P+this disc is blazing but not quite as deep as Romantic Warrior.but still Chick,Al,Stanley&amp;Lenny give up the Rock,Jazz&amp;Funk and Fuse a strong brew here.Celebration Suite Part 1&amp;2 take this disc to another  Level.the Playing is very Intense&amp;tight.when folks say so&amp;so is one  of the Greatest Guitarist of All-Time they have to Include AL DiMeola. his  solos ain't no joke.Lenny solos and they are banging.Stanley is incredible  as usual&amp;Chick Corea has no-Limits+music
Unfulfilled promise+N+The mixing on some tracks is awful, and at one point, vocals are lost altogether on The Rascals track. I love this music -- the soundtrack of my college days -- so having it on one disc for traveling (I commute 50 miles round trip every day) is great, but the quality could be lots better+music
Don Henley's Other Best Solo Album+P+THE END OF THE INNOCENCE is Don Henley's other best solo album, along with BUILDING THE PERFECT BEAST. The title song, like "The Boys Of Summer" from the previous album, made me realize that looking good for my favorite actresses was more important than attending food-related reunions at my old school, especially since most of the staff I knew are gone and many of the changes there have not been for the better. "I Will Not Go Quietly" and "New York Minute" made me realize that looking at photos of attractive female celebrities is a good way to inspire myself to avoid an individual I've had issues with BEFORE I do myself in over it, whereas "Little Tin Gods" and "If Dirt Were Dollars" skewer hypocritical preachers and gossip columnists, respectively, and "The Heart Of The Matter", like the title song, is about letting go, whether of a lost love, a grudge, or your past. Overall, THE END OF THE INNOCENCE is an album with great music and multilayered lyrical messages. The fact that Henley believes that the young Australian tourist jailed in Indonesia on drug-smuggling charges was wrongfully convicted makes this album an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience +music
Small ensemble swing at its finest (bill_faust@fitch.com)+P+Its doubtful that there have been two jazz musicians more suited to record together than Ben Webster and Sweets Edison. Alumni of the Ellington and Basie bands respectively, these two mainstream swing players have marvelous  chemistry on this session. The charts are perfect vehicles for Webster's  warm tone and silky phrasing as well as Edison's blues-ridden melodic style  that matured in the mid and late 1950's. Most of the tunes swing hard  anchored by a solid Basie-esque rhythm section. You'll wear this one out+music
avenue BLUE+P+I have found that anything that Jegg Golub does is absolutely wonderful. He has managed to take artist like Eric Claptan, Johnny Lang, Stevie Ray Von, BB king, Seagar and the list goes on, and gives you alittle of  everyones style all in one song and then mixes his own style in to boot.  All of his work is a must hear. If you like soul, blues, and jazz. here ya  go. Brenda Burnet+music
Eagles learn to rock. Great stuff!!!+P+This has 4 stone cold rock classics on it - Hotel California, New Kid in Town, Life in the Fast Lane and Victim of Love. For these songs alone the album deserves 4 stars. The rest I can pretty much do without. I'm not a big fan of the slower songs sung by Don Henley, such as Wasted Time and The Last Resort - he sounds much better singing the grittier rock songs. The guitar work throughout is amazing - i still get chills listening to the guitar solo on H.C. even after all this time. Felder and Walsh sound great together. I hear they're recording a new album for release late this year and it's a shame that Felder is no longer in the band. Anyone who plays guitar like he does is going to be missed, if not by the band then definitely by us listeners+music
Good Stuff, Great Sound+P+Very nice collection of mid to late 60's top 40 tracks. First time true stereo on "Love Is All Around" and "Whiter Shade Of Pale", and even the ones you may have already sound better than ever. I might have left off "Keep On Dancing" for something that hasn't popped up on a dozen other compilations, but that's a minor gripe. I don't think that any oldies collector will be disappointed with this CD.  Like the other guy said, just buy it. +music
Contemplative Goldbergs+P+Bach wrote very, very few variation compositions like the "Goldberg Variations," but the one's he wrote are most memorable and monumental.  Early in his career, he wrote a magnificant "Aria with Variations in the Italian Manner" (BWV989).  Its repeating aria at the end along with the alternating fast/bright and slow/contemplative variations foreshadowed a model in these so-called Goldberg Variations  - one of the towering 'summation works' Bach wrote late in his life at Leipzig.   With a full quiver of splendid recordings of Bach's keyboard music, it is not hard to believe that Angela Hewitt is the top-selling musical artist for the British Hyperion label.  And this recording of her personal favorite Golderg Variations is another worthwhile CD in the series.  Angela Hewitt's Goldbergs - and really all her Bach or Couperin in general - may be most simplistically characterized as having a more gentle, graceful and heartfelt style.  She particularly excells on bringing out the joyful rhythms in the many Baroque-era 'dances' and as well as the inherent songfulness within the music.  Technically, her smooth-as-silk long legato line, tasteful ornamental infusions, and intelligent progression all combine to create a delightful experience with Bach as heard in this fine recording.    Additionally, Hewitt is a master tonal colorist and is not shy to tactfully use the pedals and nuances of the modern piano to create a greater richness in the music - while taking care to avoid blurring her individual lines.  Accordingly, she elects a wide dynamic range for this recording to elicit maximum expressivity.  Where a pianist like Glenn Gould goes for maximum clarity of parts by completely avoiding the pedal (creating razor-sharp articulations within a very-forward recorded sound), Hewitt strives to balance crisp articulation with tonal beauty through such pianistic nuances as well as through a somewhat-spacious (but clear) recording ambiance.  Her creativity in ornamentation and well-chosen shifts of tempo in the repeats (which she observes here) adds stylistic interest - but without straying too far from Bach's musical intentions.   In comparison to other Goldberg recordings (such as Perhahia's Award-Winning disc), Angela Hewitt's readings here seems to possess a more introspective, pensive tone and mood overall. Perhaps in the back of her mind she is tempering her expression in light of the legend that Bach wrote these pieces for his student Goldberg to play at night to help his employer, the insomniac Count Keyserling, pass the time during his sleepness nights.  Hewitt's expressivity in the opening and closing Aria is as expected, thoughtful and beautiful.  But, in the famous 25th "Black Pearl" Variation, she creates a somewhat veiled atmosphere with a slower tempo not unlike a funeral march.  Personally, I felt it a bit too heavy rather than the more poignant and optimistic mood of Perahia - but such is art and individual preference.  Contrastingly, in the brilliant fast variations, Miss Hewitt brings an ebulient clarity and precision to the music that is refreshing to mind and spirit.  But, it is not the fully unleashed joy that Murray Perahia finds (in movements like the first variation) which overflow with a special vivacity.  But Hewitt's readings here overall are no less enjoyable or admirable as such nuances are often purely personal.  I tend to prefer Perahia's sparkling version on a sunny morning and Hewitt's more contemplative recording when reading late at night.  Other notable Goldberg recordings come from the Bach legend Rosalyn Tureck whose recordings are often a model for any serious student of the piano. Hungarian pianist Andras Schiff has also recorded some gorgeous Bach that often has a similar "sweetness" of style as Hewitt.  As for Glenn Gould, his landmark 1955/1982 recordings rightfully caused a stirring in the music world and have a striking individuality and brilliantly clear articulation of voices (assuming you don't mind his intermittent humming and the less-than-perfect sound quality).  Many others have also given great performances.  Hewitt's Goldberg CD received strong ratings from from many of the top reviewers like Penguin Guide and Gramophone and stands with a few others among the finer recordings.  ClassicsToday was a bit more critical, giving this CD a rating of 8/10 for Artistic Quality and 9/10 for Sound Quality (noting a tendency for emotive restraint in some variations).  I mostly agree with this last (8/10) assessment - out of Hewitt's Bach discography, I found her Goldbergs very enjoyable but just not quite as magical as her others.  But, an additional highlight of this Hyperion CD is surely the superbly annotated notes revealing some history of this music and Ms. Hewitt's musical insights and approaches to each of the 30 variations.  The notes alone might make Hewitt's CD preferable to others if you already have a version you really like.  All-in-all, a most attractive and admirable recording (4.5 stars); but, like other reviewers and Gramophone conclude, Perahia's sparkling version (5 stars) strikes me as very special and takes top honors here in my opinion+music
Aint nobody hatin, this cd is garbage+N+With the exception of Missy, and Lil kim track, this whole cd will make a great coaster at best. The only who can truly enjoy this album is someone who has a one track mind for partyin' only. This is no hip hop compilation. Straight dance to the fullest. Pop for the most part. And tracks of hits that i didn't even no was hits, by a rapper almost no one cares about. Even though I do like some of what he puts out but still, addin yourself on hits album just make people diss him more+music
Track 14 / Worth the price of the CD+P+I agree with other reviewers here -- much of the music on the CD is simply supplemental to the film, is forgetable, nothing really stands out, there is a lack of melody.  Only one track (# 14) "My Name is Lincoln" -- stands apart, offering a theme, melody, choir and resolution -- it is a signature bit of composing that, for me, is really worth the price of the CD+music
Marvellous fun and great singing+P+I have to say that I prefer Handel's Tamerlano for musical reasons. However, Vivaldi's opera on the same subject is very enjoyable and entertaining. Like it has been said of the operas of Haydn, Vivaldi's operas are not great operas, but they do contain great music.  Europa Galante, directed from the 1st violin by Fabio Biondi, is in great form and I've never heard them play better. I have their older recording of Handel's opera Poro, and I enjoyed that one, too.  The singers here are an excellent ensemble. I like the dark and expressive voice of Ildebrando D'Arcangelo - he was also marvellous as Leporello in Gardiner's Don Giovanni. David Daniels is fantastic, as usual, and he is possibly the best operatic countertenor in the world at the moment. Patrizia Ciofi is best heard and not seen - sweet voice coming from a madwoman (check out the DVD!). Vivica Genaux has been hyped to within a centimetre of her life recently. She has a nice flexible mezzo voice. A little too much vibrato for my tastes and she looks like a chipmunk when she attacks coloratura passages. Marijana Mijanovic sings well - she was excellent as the neurotic Penelope in the Christie / L.A.F. DVD of Monteverdi's Il Ritorno d'Ulisse in patria. She is alarmingly thin - possible health problems? She doesn't engage with the conductor or orchestra at all in the DVD - the only singer who doesn't. Elina Garanca looks beautiful (and healthy!) and sings beautifully. She has a lovely contralto voice. I hope I see and hear more from this artist in the future.   I am not a big fan of Vivaldi's operas - I enjoy them as collections of arias. I wonder how well Bajazet worked on stage? I'd love to have a DVD of this production, I would like to see how a Vivaldi opera works on stage. Vivaldi's operas don't have imaginative scorings and the orchestral passages are fairly prosaic. A lot of what goes on in the Vivaldi operas I've heard (I have a few in my CD collection) is pretty routine. However, I am open minded on the subject and I would like to see how well a Vivaldi opera works on stage.+music
Looking for more like this album?+P+Melanie White and other reviewers have wondered what else out there might be similar to "Appalachia Waltz." I highly recommend Oliver Schroer's double-disc "O2". Same fusion of folk fiddle idiom and classical violin. In places astoundingly brilliant. Lovers of Bach will see many influences here (yet I wouldn't call Schroer's work derivative.) In the liner notes, Schroer talks about making his work not just polyphonic but also fractal--funny thing is, the more you listen, the more "fractal" it sounds. Unbelievable.+music
Wonderful!+P+A wonderful CD with the power to thoroughly relax even the most stressed-out people. Easy enough for background playing during dinner or a conversation, and serious enough to be full of magic when listening to it  exclusively. Great buy at a great price+music
by the might of horris you shall kneel beef or us+N+Beef is an excellent source of protei+music
You have gotta be joking+N+It is laughable to read some of these other reviews. But whats not funny is how bad 50 Cent is. He is the worst rapper of all time a total disgrace to hip hop music. He has no love for the music only for the money. I don't know how he sells so many records but that just shows how many people don't know real music+music
The best score I've ever heard!+P+Carpenter really knew what he was doing when he got Walker to help with the score.  Makes super background music for Quake II.  The sounds are FAR more detailed than in EFNY.  It's the bomb, as they say.  I've had it for  two months, and I still get a kick out of the main theme and the motorcycle  chase.  Kudos, Carpenter+music
amazing results+P+i had a very colicky baby from 2 weeks old to 10 weeks old and this was the best cd of all the ones i tried (classical, lullabye, ocean sounds, television, etc) to calm my baby and most importantly, to keep him sleeping longer. the last track was his favorite, the sound of the rain. he sleeps so much longer now that i play that track on "repeat" all night long. and i can get things done during his naps because the rain sound covers up the noise of me in the kitchen, etc. And, when he is really cranky and there's nothing else i can do for him, i can put him down in his bed and play the whole cd from start to finish and it calms him and puts him to sleep 75% of the time, which is a huge improvement from other attempts.+music
Favorite Album Ever+P+I've never written a review for anything (I'm pretty sure). It's just like: "Whatever" to me, but I read some guy's review of Keep it Like a Secret by Built To Spill (by the way: couldn't recommend that album any more highly. Buy it now.). I lost my train of thought, but  Here's what I'm getting at:  This album changed my life. Not even kidding.  Besides, maybe, Giant Steps, this is the most important piece of music of all time. Of all the time in my life, of course. I don't know about yours.  Do me a favor and pick it up now.  Seriously, I couldn't even quantify or qualify the effect this album has on me with words or numbers or any other means of expression beyond this: This album changed my life.  Seriously, you don't even get it.  God man, I've been listening to this album since I was in second grade. My all time favorite.  Buy Ruby Vroom, too. Stay away from El Oso. And Mike Doughty's solo stuff. I mean, get it if you want. I don't care.   Just go read some Soul Coughing lyrics. Just take like, 2 minutes out of your day. You're not even doing anything important right now. Are you? No.  http://scug.net/, man. Thats all. Just go there. Read some of the words. Look at the pictures.  Seriously, you don't even get it. I took the liner notes out of the case (which I lost) and taped them to my wall. I'm not even kidding.   sigh  aklsjdfl;asjkdfkl;asdj   -wilso+music
Save Your Money+N+I am so dissapointed in this CD. I bought it because I have "Blow By Blow" and "Jeff Beck with the Jan Hammer Group" and I love those CDs. This crap sounds like somebody that heard those recordings, practiced for one week and tried to do an imitation of them. I don't like one cut on the entire CD. I only gave it one star because I couldn't find a way to give it less.+music
stick to live stuff+N+judging by the clips offered from amazon, this cd sounded like it could be as good as gba material, but i was dissapointed after the first spin, and i haven't put it back in since. It's not bad stuff, just that the jams are  lacking in creativity, and the true funk feel is missing. Try Greyboy  allstars(who are the BEST live), or try the next level in jambads: PHISH+music
AMAZING+P+I love every kind of music and I recently was introduced to Tom Waits. My faviorte genre is metal but I cant stop listening to this guy. His voice is amazing and all his songs are wonderful. Pasties And A G-String (At The Two O'Clock Club) and Step Right Up are my faviorte on this cd. I own a few other cds by Waits and I have yet to hear this guy make a bad song+music
Stunning technique, needs much work+N+This performer deserves all the latitude necessary, as she may yet develop into a relevant, insightful, and original interpreter of the music she offers. I truly hope she does not choose to compete with Eliot Fisk in the Indy-500 or the 24-Hours of Le Mans. Based on the samples, I won't be buying this CD as I can program my computer to play just as fast or even faster, and just as clear. Instead, I recommend the Frank Bungarten recording (also available on Amazon). But Ana Vidovic does show a lot of promise, and deserves encouragement+music
En La Luna Con REYLI+P+Un poco triste que Reyli ya no forme parte de ELEFANTE. En este disco nos muestra (aun mas) su gran talento pero como solista.  Sus canciones: "Amor del bueno", "Desde que llegaste" y "Calma" son hermosas.  Y quien no ha escuchado el tema musical, "La descarada", de la muy popular telenovela Rubi? Comprenlo hoy+music
A few high points but mostly dull+N+Aphrodite must have been preoccupied when he mixed this one. For the most part the tracks drag on with no end in sight or build toward some invisible (and unmelodic) climax. There are a few with powerful beats and creative touches such as tracks 14 featuring Jungle Brothers and 13 featuring N.W.A. But for the most part the rappers take center stage and Aphrodite doesn't add much. If you really want to sample his talent buy his self titled CD+music
LIFT HIM UP! ENOUGH SAID+N+I List Hezekiah Walker , Donnie McClurckin and Micah Stampley as gospel vocalist with the most range and you hear how much range he has at the end of lift him up, he is almost singing soprano. This album takes awhile to get used to.There is a Mix between live songs and studio songs, different from all of the rest of Walkers' albums.My favorite song is lift him up, and im pretty much satisfied with the album because it lifts me up when i listen to it.I was  blessed to see Hezekiah Walker live and he sung lift him up, ive played in my car ever since and its hard not to shout off of it.I must say I like the live recordings better because i love live instruments .The one thing i must say is that Hezekiah Walker does not dissapoint and his music is about ministry and not about all the technical stuff that musicians and song writers worry about. Hez carries an anointing nobody else carries, he is a pastor first and a singer second, his albums are not about lyrics there about ministry and lifting up jesus.so if you are someone that cares more about lyrics than anointing you might want to  try someone else whose anointing is not as powerful as Hezekiah Walker+music
Better Than Just "1980s Music"+P+As ballad pop goes, Journey is there. These are the songs which were played at proms throughout the 1980s. Filled with romance, emotional passion and Steve Perry's unrelenting voice, Journey's "The Essential Journey" are a mix of hard, mild and melodic pop rock.   Occasionally, the band would turn out mediocre music, like "Girl Can't Help It," but most is still worth listening to. "Be Good to Yourself" sounds like a bad movie soundtrack song, and is not worthy of this otherwise amazing CD.  There are two disks, with more music than the average listener is familiar with, and only hardcore fans with know. A few hits are missing, leaving a real best-of CD still out there.  Journey was a pop band: Simple lyrics without a heavy message. Distinguishing them was their willingness to step out of the known musical formulas. Club music was coming into its own in the 1980s, with DJs sampling and mixing. Their music doesn't sample well, and they risked being a radio-only band. As their hit list grew from "Lovin' Touchin' Squeezin'" into a rich repertoire, their concerts became packed into stadiums. Those are the songs here.   It is 1980s music in every sense of the term, but better than just as music from the period, just like James Taylor is better than just being a musician from the 1970s. I fully recommend, "The Essential Journey" by Journey.   Anthony Trendl  editor, HungarianBookstore.co+music
Superb Intonation, great music, incredibly beautiful!+P+This is a great CD with the Dance Movements being my favorite.  UNT plays wonderully, intonation is great.  Highly recommended band literature+music
Wow...+P+This album is fantastic.  I can't really compare it to other Melvins albums since they all have something different about them, but take my word for it that this one is great.  This one is unique from every other Melvins release for two reasons:  1.  They have a second drummer on this thing, and  2.  There are TONS of vocal harmonies in this album.  My thoughts on both:  The two drummers thing, awesome, the fills and solos are amazing, I never thought they'd find a way to make Dale Crover's work even better, turns out they did, they had another amazingly talented guy drum with him.  Its astounding.  If you play the drums, you need to hear this album.  The vocal harmonies thing, really cool too.  It makes the sound very unique, gives it another layer.   All that said, the album itself is also unlike the other Melvins albums in that most of it is really fast.  The Melvins are characteristically famous for their sludgey, slow sound.  They still toss out a few slow numbers here, but by and large its chock full of incredibly intelligent, speedy metal songs.  And they're awesome!  The Melvins sound great playing fast!  The intro to "The Hawk" just TEARS!!!  I don't even know how to compose my thoughts about this album other than to say it carries the fine Melvins tradition of doing something to vastly alter their sound on every album, and also, its fantastic.  It rocks so hard.  I mean, if you thought The Maggot was an awesome fistfull of metal, check out A Senile Animal, its even better.  I should also point out that this is probably their best starter album.  Meaning that if you don't own any Melvins albums and never heard of them, this one is the best place to start.  I know it's not their classic sludge sound, but the Melvins are not an accessable band.  Their music, while intelligent, awesome, and incredibly powerful, takes a while to figure out.  You have to give the Melvins a good couple of listens before it just sort of clicks in your head and you realize how brilliant these guys can be.  Take their self titled album (or "Lysol" to the diehards), for example.  Its a great brilliant Melvins album; one of their best, as most fans will tell you.  But if you were trying to expose someone who's never heard of the Melvins to their music, you wouldn't dare start them out with Lysol, it would go right over their heads.  So thats why its nice to see a Melvins album like "A Senile Animal" come out, becuase the intelligenece and the power is still there, but overall its a much easier experience to wrap your brain around.  So thank you, Melvins, for making yet another wonderful, unique, challenging-yet-still-accessable (not to mention HEAVY) album.  And those of you reading this not knowing a thing about the Melvins, buy this album.  If you're a metal fan and you have half a brain, you'll love it.  Then pick up The Maggot, Stoner Witch, and Houdini.  Now that you realize that this is one of the best musical acts still performing today, go for the golden material with Gluey Portch Treatments, Bullhead, and Lysol.    As a side point, how can Buzz still be doing this?  Its been like two decades and he's STILL making some of the best metal riffs in existance.  How can you go that long, putting out album after album, and still be tossing out all these fantastic, wonderfully heavy metal riffs left and right?  Its inhuman+music
Hate to admit it+N+Hate to admit it but this just isn't very good.  Been a fan since 'Slowhand' so i've been frequently disappointed and underwhelmed by Clapton, but this is just amazing.  This has everything going for it but it just doesn't come together.  The featured review by 'Woomer' mirrors my feelings that nothing since 'From the Cradle' has been worthwhile barring 'Riding with the King' and that was helped immensely by King himself.  Toss this onto the heap along with 'Reptile' and 'Pilgrim'+music
Worst Band Album+N+Unless one considers "Planet Waves," Dylan's 1974 studio album with the Band playing backup, to be a Band album, "Cahoots" has no competition for the title of the worst Band album ever. Yes, the first two tracks are good ("Life is a Carnival" - great rhythms, great horns, OK lyrics; and Dylan's "Masterpiece" -- does nothing for me, but I understand many people love it), but they are available on other compilations, so the reason to shell out for "Cahoots" has to reside in the remaining tracks if anywhere, and they are AWFUL. The songs, that is, not the performances. The boys sing and play as well as ever, but their efforts -- particularly some fine Danko vocals and Hudson horn playing -- are wasted on songs that are utterly tuneless, charmless and brainless. There is not a single memorable musical phrase on tracks 3-11. Nor do the bonus tracks on this reissue rescue the enterprise: all are either available elsewhere in equivalent or superior versions or are unworthy of inclusion on anything (a RADIO COMMERCIAL?!). Save your money for any of the worthier products of this wonderful group of musicians+music
Teena's tender, romantic,sensitive and soulful side.+P+The fact that this CD includes the stunningly-beautiful ballad "Miracles Need Wings To Fly" should provide incentive enough to buy it. This great compilation brings most of Teena's greatest romantic ballads together for the first time--and at a budget price. Given her enormous talent, it's (almost) incredible that Teena has rarely gotten the mainstream recognition she naturally deserves. If you can only get one Teena Marie CD this is definitely THE one+music
Hot.+P+I'm probably looking for something different than proper techno-heads, but I found that the entire album is good dancing music (Latin...think Cha Cha or Samba if you're REALLY athletic) or at least fun to listen to. My favorite by far is #5, of course+music

Jewel of Hari is a convoluted Surprise of Joy and Freedom~+P+This is my favorite of her two Albums and one of my favorite CDs in my entire collection. I love devitional music, and this album is totally upbeat with tastefully interwoven Flamenco guitar, Indian Percussion, Tablas, among more modern sounding back-beats, and dance grooves. Perfect for meditation, Yoga, and even Just Getting Inspired. To me this Album has a whole lot of Aries/Libra Balance about it. It has a very FREEDOM LOVE feeling about it and yet it is very clear, balanced and awake. This album, I hated the first time I listened to it! So I sold it. The second time I listened to it, I was absoluetly shocked to Love it, and It is now one of my most favorite albums, and more frequently listened to, without ever getting sick of it. Maybe that is how I love it so much. Somehow this album merged with me in a non-conscious way, and totally snuck up on me! Wow, A very magical abum of peace and freedom in Devotional Modern Style~ very  Very Highly recommended.+music
This CD sucked+N+This is sabotage rather than a tribute to Tupac.  This doesn't do him justice.  Listening to this CD, I thought of "This is Spinal Tap" - the part where they have the miniature version of stonehenge, and everyone is looking around thinking "what the hell is going on?"  That must have been how Tupac felt at this show.  The part of the CD where you can actually hear someone flipping through "all eyez on me" trying to find the right song...that was when I knew this CD was crap.  Tupac put great pride into the quality and sound of his work.  This is an abomination.  Well, what more can you say?  Death Row needed a little extra holiday bling, I guess.... My recommendation - don't buy it.  You might as well just listen to All Eyez on Me and sing along. +music
Some kind of proof amazon reviews are only by people who are already fans+N+22 stellar reviews of this, I am flabbergasted.  I looked this up because we were talking about it on a messageboard:  patrick posted this on Aug 25th, 2006 at 09:59:53 am this looks and sounds ill in a conceptual way, it doesn't sound like Steppenwolf, right?  Peter**********IsDead posted this on Aug 25th, 2006 at 05:56:23 pm Steppenwolf have a few bangers, c'mon  and one of the best LP covers ever - [IMAGE]  i cant find a good size pic of it but if you own it you know PERFECT 70s dirtbag vibe on the cover  the_real_***** posted this on Aug 25th, 2006 at 07:11:16 pm that Steppenwolf-Monster LP has songs called Fag, Monster and Suicide, has the best cover art ever and it still totally sucks.  Negative*** posted this on Aug 25th, 2006 at 07:56:21 pm I was all stoked when I picked up monster at a garage sale. I owned it for less then 3 hours before I put it in the trash. The cover is GREAT though.  youth****** posted this on Aug 25th, 2006 at 09:18:05 pm Those song titles (Steppenwolf) are incredible beyond belief.   diffrn't strokes I gues+music
A title that Lives up+P+a Solid Title here because not only are the Songs Here Very Soulful&Timeless but the Artists Featured here are whose who that Brought Soul Music out.back in a time Period when it was a Honored to Be Called SoulFul.these Songs Represent a time Period that Brought out the Best in R&B Radio+music
A7X Kicks Ass+P+Like others have said this cd is much more harder than City of Evil, and a little harder than Waking the Fallen, but still is a good cd. If your a new fan of A7X, I would suggest getting City Of Evil first, but don,t overlook this cd+music
Magical chiming scree; a masterpiece; an aural orgasm!+P+Mid Eighties SST indie rock classic! This was the very first Sonic Youth album I owned. I got the vinyl in 87 at the age of 15 and it blew my mind and has ever since! The best song on the album in my opinion, and one of Sonic Youth's best songs period is "Expressway to yr Skull," aka "Madonna, Sean and Me," aka  "The crucifixion of Sean Penn." Whatever title you prefer, this song is a beautiful, powerful masterpiece that hits you in the soul every time. It's the most special melodic guitar masterpiece I have ever heard. Chiming scree infused with bliss, It builds to a mind melting crescendo and goes completely over the top, then the way the bass, drums and guitar work together into the mind bending recovery is aural art for sure. If you are lucky enough to hear it live you are in for a religous experience. On the vinyl it ended side 2 with a locked groove, meaning that when your turntable needle reached the end of the song instead of running out and ending it went around in a circle, playing the droning end of the song forever or until you turn it off.  While "Expressway" is a highlight, the rest of the album is awesome as well. Lyrically and sonically one of the things the sonics were into at the time this was recorded was the psychology and mythos surrounding the manson family and that era,  but that is only one aspect of this album. Another interesting thing about this album is the atmosphere it creates; many of the songs are different from one another sonically, yet the album is cohesive. Songs like "In the Kingdom #19," with its narrative style and crazy stuff going on in the background evoking thoughts of D.Boon's tragic death, and "Marilyn Moore," and "Shadow of a Doubt" just transport you atmospherically. I have recommended this album to many new listeners of SY, some find that they don't like it as much as "Sister" at first, because many of the songs aren't as "immediately accessible" as the gems of that album,  but with more listens it rewards them, it grows on them and they like it as much or more. Bublegum is a cover, I believe of an old Kim Fowley song and was not on the original release, but was a B-side (of the Starpower single if I remember correctly) added in the CD age. It seems somewhat out of place, especially following expressway. In any event, this recording is one of SY's best, and in my opinion one of the best period. Buy it, it's magical. +music
You Won't Hear Better Blues Traveler +P+I loved this album when I first heard it in 1993. Since then, nothing Blues Traveler has created can compare, really. It all pales in comparison. For the best Blues Traveler you'll ever hear (although it would be nice if that weren't the case), get this CD+music
Manuel makes this a masterpiece+P+Without the soulful voice of Richard Manuel, this album would be drowning in MOR. But he lifts the music into an indescribably emotional area - Right as Rain, Georgia on my mind particularly. He performed almost the same miracle on Northern Lights, Southern Cross. Maybe Islands contains markedly inferior songs and some lacklustre performances, but it is nowhere near as bad as it has been painted. Listen to Richard...+music
The Best of Heatwave:  Always & Forever+N+While I purchased the CD for the title song, I was a little disappointed in the rest of the CD. I guess I didn't know the group's repertoire as well as I thought+music
Not the answer for me+N+I have tested this CD several times and the results came out the same: I still could not sleep. It must work for some, based on the other reviews, but I found the melodies distracting if not annoying.+music
Hard to listen to.+N+I was very excited to own this album knowing that this was a jazztronica album from one of the ECM masters. After struggling to listen to this album several times I have to say Molvaer would do better to stick to the more straight ahead, or perhaps find another producer for such outings. The electronic textures and ambience are fine, and the playing is nothing less than you would expect. Really it's just the beats that make this album unlistenable to me. Extremely cheesy and extremely cliche. My friend commented to me that it reminds him of a 90's movie soundtrack. I think that's about right. Molvaer is a great player, but he's a bit out of touch with some of the genres he was hoping to capture on this record. For jazztronica I would go with Dave Douglas' "Freak In" or the aforementioned E.S.T+music
Solid As A Rock? Not Really+N+2 and a half stars.  This is not an accurate representation of Bay Area Hip-Hop. It's a mediocre attempt in trying to appeal to the mainstream audience. Bay Area artists that signed major deals never made an album that was creatively better than their independent releases. Don't waste your time with this record and buy his last album "I Give You My Word".  Highlights of "The Rock"- Frisco Stand Up, Planet Fillmoe, So Young, Way More Than They Can See, Pimps & Hustlas+music
Boring+N+I bought this for my mom and even though she's a big fan she only liked the first 5 songs. The second disk is a complete snooze+music
It Doesn't Have Soul.+N+I bought Usher's 8701 on tape long ago, and I remember liking it. Then a couple of years ago, I bought it again on cd, listened to it, and wondered why I wasted my money.  Maybe it's the fact that I've grown, but this album sounds so un-soulful now. It is just lacking any spirit, sort of like an over-produced record: all studio magic, but no magic from the singer. Even the songs that are SUPPOSED to sound heartfelt, don't. The album sounds dated, not transcendent of time and era like all the albums that become classics. The songs are very forgettable, and I don't see any of them being seen as classics twenty years from now.  Usher has yet to make a masterpiece.  Addendum: I was a little unfair in my rating. The album deserves 3 stars, not 2. Unfortunately, I can't change it.+music
My ears, oh no, my ears!+N+This presentation of Mr. Boone's deserves a 1 for effort, a 5 for the best bad thing I've ever heard.  He made of mess of Little Richard's "Tutti Fruitti" way back when.  So, in keeping with such destruction, he went after our precious metal hits.  Funny stuff, though.  I keep thinking of the those sad off the strip casino bands trying to entertain folks who just want a $1.99 breakfast and a win at the nickel machines. +music
Warning: Mislabeled as a Karaoke title.  This is a Sing Along.+N+Conventional Karaoke titles use CD-G formats.  This should have been labelled a Disney Sing along Album.  Printed lyrics do not make a Karaoke CD which is entirely misleading the general consumer.  Fortunately the variety of songs and quality of the recordings still give a strong entertainment value for your child.  If you want the variety of Disney music, here it is.  If you want a sing along album, especially if you do not have a Karaoke player, you have your wish.    If you want a Karaoke format, look elsewhere. +music
No fun!+N+I can not believe this is marketed as a karaoke CD!  This is just a regular music CD with the lyrics inside the package.  The lyrics do NOT show up on the TV screen when put into the karaoke machine.  No fun at all if you have to hold the microphone with one hand the the lyrics in another, under good light because the type is so small!!!!  Oh yeah, great fun for a 6 year old.....NOT!!+music
I like AC/DC but I hate this+N+I like most of AC/DC's music, but I can't stand their latest album Stiff Upper Lip.  Stiff Upper Lip is the only AC/DC album where you can play it all the way through, and not even hear one good song.  Stiff Upper Lip doesn't even come close to being as good as Back in Black or Highway to Hell.  Every song on it just bugs the heck out of me.  Listening to one song off this album is enough to test my patience; but enduring all 12 of these musical abominations is enough to drive me crazy!  The overall sound is very similar to their earlier albums like Highway to Hell or Back in Black.  BUT...those CDs had variety, they were semi original, and they were actually pretty good.  THIS CD is just completely worthless.  I have heard some cra ppy CDs in my lifetime, but none of them were more pain to listen to than this.  The vocalist sounds about 10 times worse than he did on their earlier albums, the music is chunky, repetitive, dull, and boring, and most of the songs sound the same. Stiff Upper Lip is so bland and dull sounding that it sounds more like the monotonous droning of an electric fan than a rock n roll band.  The music is so repetitive and similar sounding that its more like listening to the same annoying song for 60 minutes than 12 separate tracks.  This CD is just unbelievaby terrible.  It is a disgrace to this band's legacy, and the band members should be embarrased by it.  Oh well, I guess they probably only made this album because they needed to fulfill their record contract, so I guess they don't care about how awful it is anyway.  All I can tell you potential buyers is to stay as far away from this piece of garbage as possible.  It is a TOTAL piece of cr ap and it is not fit to listen to.  Go buy a GOOD AC/DC CD like Let there Be Rock, High Voltage, Powerage, Highway to Hell, or Back in Black.  Stiff Upper Lip suc ks so hard it leaves a big purple bruise.  It's so awful I'd rather listen to the new Nickelback CD than this!+music
Actually, I like these guys+N+They had a swagger at Monterey 67 and were in the right place at the right time.  I like about 3 tracks on this album (their first and best).  I can't recommend it to the masses, I purchased this mainly for historical purposes.  You MUST listen to Jefferson Airplane (first 2 albums only), Peanut Butter Conspiracy (first 2 albums only), Grateful Dead (skip first 2 ablums) before you dig this deep for lost nuggets+music
Best Female Singer Of The Past 40 Years.+P+Pat Benatar is a natural. This compilation has been thoroughly reviewed, so I will focus on four very different songs. Her phenomenal voice comes piercing through on "Heartbreaker," a jaunty tune with catchy lyrics & intense energy. In "I need a lover," she deciphers a females self-awareness that is rarely heard from in this genre of music. "We Live For Love," is a smooth sensual song that appeals to the romantic in all of us. This one is good for dancing or driving on a breezy autumn day. "Hell Is For Children," a deeply disturbing tune with its descriptions of child abuse. It brings out any decent persons protectiveness towards kids everywhere. Lastly, in "Love Is A Battlefield." She takes the listener on a roller coaster ride of emotions. The honest lyrics & her perfect delivery makes one ponder the title. All of her fans will be pleased with this entire compilation. It has no flaws+music

Quality Retro+P+Whatever happened to melody, creativity, individuality and good old  beats?  Somewhere along the line it has been replace by singers who can't sing, write or play an instrument, songs without melodies and beats as monotonous as a flywheel.  Fortunately the Eurythmics are of the former school - turning out original, quality hits that showed a spark of genius at times.  ("Sweet Things" is perhaps the most famous song of the decade - deservedly so.) The haunting voice, odd instrumentation and artistic approach to every track makes this one a winner.  My grade: +music
Very Enjoyable+P+I'm writing this review to respond to a reviewer's frustrations that the liner notes he received were those belonging to the "Sweet Dreams" album.  This happened to me as well when I bought the CD from Borders.  So, I got a refund for it, bought a copy from Barnes and Noble, and the same thing happened.  Finally, I took my money to Best Buy, and found the correct liner notes!  So, the Barnes and Noble/Best Buy shipments must have been faulty.  For those interested in purchasing the album, I found it quite enjoyable.  I'm too young to have had the original LPs, so any bonus tracks released were nice to have.  I found the photos intriguing as well, once I had the correct booklet!  In my opinion though, it was worth the effort to have the correct liner notes+music
Disappointing+N+Jim Messina has played in a some great bands. He played in the Buffalo Springfield, a group of young legends.  He also played in Poco, probably the most under-appreciated and under-rated band of the era.  With these credentials, you can put Messina's name up there with the likes of Stills, Furay, Young, Nash, Crosby, Frey and Browne.  Then he teams up with Kenny Loggins, and things get bad.  I picked up this album, expecting greatness from these two, and I simply didn't find it.  What I found was two decent tunes surrounded by silly and annoying pop.  Most songs on here have simple lyrics, and are over-produced.  I do like two songs on here.  "Till The Ends Meet" is a nice, easy tune, and Loggins sounds very nice on this one.  The other song I like is "Angry Eyes." The intro is very cool, and the singing interplay between Loggins and Messina is fun and interesting here.  The main point here is that this album does not live up to expectation in the least.  There's no folk, no country rock, no free and easy feeling to this one.  This is blatant pop-music.  If you like bouncy pop, this might be for you.  If you're looking for anything like Poco or Buffalo Springfield, you will experience a huge bummer.+music
Near-forgotten master of jazz guitar: buy this if you can...+P+Mr. Farlow came along years before Wes Montgomery, and never achieved Wes's level of mass appeal. Listen to this 1956 album, however, and you will be amazed. This expanded CD has 63 swinging minutes of guitar, piano and bass, but the trio sounds like a quintet at least. The old standards are recognizable, the tunes written without lyrics are interesting, and the absence of horns or drums isn't noticed at all. I wanted this when it was an LP but never got my hands on it. I have coveted it on CD the last few years, looking for a bargain price, but finally settled on something close to full retail. It's worth it. Enjoyable all the way through, I could see how a real guitar lover might declare this to be his favorite jazz disc ever. I expect to hear this one a lot over the next year or two, and to be fully satisfied. Read the other reviews posted here for &quot;why&quot; it works, and &quot;how&quot; Tal was so good. As a non-musician, all I can say is &quot;This one is great fun and what 50's jazz was all about.&quot+music
Boring+N+I love Morton Feldman. I have a lot of his music, and I especially like the Second String Quartet. Triadic Memories leaves me indifferent. It may be the performance, I don't know. But the music is boring. And repeat listenings only confirm my experience+music
For diehards only.+N+Let me start by putting out a couple of my biases before getting into this review-- first, I relaly don't care for remixes as a rule, unless they're dramatic and severely restructure a song, I generally find they add little. Second, I really don't care for "The Hand That Feeds".  Having said that, the piece is presented in three mixes, the album version, the Straight mix, and the Dub mix. The album version has a catchy, circular guitar line and a straightahead drum beat that's actually decent until the bridge with this bizarrely irritating spoken wordish section. Just doesn't work.  The remixes fare no better-- the Straight mix adds different rock beats and an extended introduction that eventually becomes tedious, the dub mix layers a grating sustained guitar note over a beat and a mumbled repeated take on the chorus.  If you're a fan, get it. If not, skip this one, there's good reasons it wasn't released in the U.S+music
Slim Gaillard is a musical genius+P+When you're young, it's quite fashionable to bemoan the lack of authentic individuals. When you grow older, you learn that you were correct. My Cherokee ancestors believe that adulthood begins at 51, and as I get closer to that age, I realize how right they are. Well, here's an individual for you. Slim Gaillard.   I have a four-CD set called LAUGHING IN RHYTHM. 1937 through 1952 from one of the great innovators in jazz. Musically creative, technically skillful, always soulful, lyrically hilarious, and perhaps an example of somebody under age 51 achieving adulthood. I can't stop listening to it. At home, in my MP3 player on the buses of China... Lemme get nuts here. If you ignore every other review I've ever written, note these three words. "Buy this one." It's like that, folks. Slim is da bomb.+music
Absolute Perfection+P+What can you say - this is a PERFECT song. There is not a flawed moment in it. I, too heard this on the Before Sunset trailer and was mesmerized by its beauty. Makes ME swoon. Love it+music
I see there is no 187+N+Making it no reason to even consider getting this filler filled P.O.S+music
Another step forward for the mighty Sepultura!+P+Dante XXI  What a fantastic album! A huge achievement by a band that continues to produce excellent music despite a huge amount of criticism from fans of Cavalera-era Sepultura.  It's surprising that people can't get over the fact that Max Cavalera left a whole decade ago. Since then Sep have moved on and I doubt they would have made Dante XXI had Max still been at the helm. Frankly, bands should be applauded for pushing the boundaries of themselves and their fans. If you follow a band, it's sometimes worth having a little faith in them, I feel. I guess we fall in love with a band after hearing a couple of albums and that those albums become the band. But the band themselves have a totally different perspective! The music they produce is a product of the dynamics of the members of the band, their abilities, relative strengths, experience, musical preferences etcetera. All of these factors can change over time; indeed SHOULD change over time. Hence, aspects of Sep's music have changed also. How sad would it be to say that Sepultura had learnt nothing new in the last 10 years? That their music had been influenced by nothing that has happened to them? Why would anyone want them to keep copying the sound of their earlier work? Would you really want Sepultura to just regurgitate Arise and Chaos AD tracks? Wouldn't that just put them on a par with bands like Status Quo? How utterly tragic that would be.  When playing live, they play a huge number of older songs because they know we want to hear them too. So, if you want older stuff, don't expect it on a new album - go see them live. They're better live than on a disc any day!  Dante XXI is certainly more consistently thrashy than their other post-Cavalera output. (So, if you've been missing that aspect of Sepultura: here it is!) Green's vocals are awesome; there are terrific riffs and fantastic rhythm. It's hard to pick a favourite, but if pressed, I'd recommend you listen to 'Fighting On' - and turn it up VERY LOUD!  With Dante XXI, Sepultura continue to successfully broaden the musical boundaries of both themselves and their fans.  So, set aside your preconceptions and give this album a good listen - you'll love it. +music
Oregon's "Prime" is sadly mistitled+N+I have been a fan of Oregon's since they surprised me at the 1974 Newport in New York jazz festival. They walked onto the Avery Fischer Hall stage in saffron gowns, grabbing their tablas, sitars, and other Indian instruments, and all I could say to myself was, "Oh, THIS won't be jazz." Their electrifying performance proved otherwise. It was the best set I heard in the entire festival, and Oregon went on to be a progressive force in jazz for many years afterward. However, I found "Prime" to be much like the homogenized music that populates the "smooth jazz" airways. Though their performances are still of virtuoso quality, the compositions on this CD struck me as formless, generic and unmemorable. I will always appreciate Oregon's body of work, but I cannot recommend this CD as one that is representative of their prodigious gifts+music
Not Pleased+N+I am so happy you sent me this e-mail.  I purchased this CD for my brother for Christmas and you sent me the wrong CD - I received something called WHORACLE by IN FLAMES which is not what I ordered and I am really disappointed and I would really like it if you would send me what I ordered, which is the Jimmy Buffett CD - THE ULTIMATE COLLECTION......... Please get back to me.  Thank you, Rosane Cassell+music
AWESOME Vanity 6 club dance classic+P+Of course I remember back when I first heard this song; I was still in high school (yes, the 80's), and it was not from the BHC movie either (I wasn't allowed to see it in theaters). It was at a local club a few years later. This song has not only a KILLER beat that ANYONE can dance to, but KILLER lyrics, singers, and that it was produced by Prince himself - so naturally this song WAS a winner. Still is. It rocks, baby. And I PROUDLY have several copies on CD, cassette AND mp3. A little obsessed perhaps???? Not really. But this literate one-hit-wonder was an indeed dance-club classic, similar to Eddie Murphy's dance hit class one-hit-wonder "Party all the Time".  I love singing along to this hit song. And the singers are sharp, focused, and are actually VERY GOOD VOCALISTS. The music flows very smoothly throughout the song, especially the break, where the girl says, "I don't like this groove....give me something I can CROON to.....catch my drift???"    PEANU+music
Disappointing+N+Not nearly up to the standards of their first CD.  Includes too many sophomoric teenage love songs+music
motown dance  review by josephine yong+N+there is good tune you can dance over and over again "LET IT WHIP"  by the dazz band. the rest are  funky wild music not for elective taste+music
Adaptation Soundtrack+N+I purchased the Adaptation soundtrack thinking the song from the trailer and the V.W. commercial would be on it. The soundtrack is nothing more than very horrible sounds, nothing from the trailer and very expensive. False advertising at it's best+music
Who is this band and what have they done with Modest Mouse?+N+Modest Mouse are reported to be living somewhere inside this album.  I, however, cannot find them.  This is the first music they have released that is completely forgettable.  It comes out of the speakers, into your ears and then disappears.  All of the previous MM releases, and I've heard, loved and lived them all, are unique, enduring and beloved pieces of music; this record is not of that ilk.  And that's a real shame, MM are one of the finest bands of the past 10 or 15 years, right up there with the likes of Ween, Built to Spill and all of the Jagjaguwar bands.  Oh well, a rare miss.  I'm still a huge fan, still gonna go see them whenever the tour rolls around (definately go see them live, when Isaac isn't too drunk, the shows can be legendary), still gonna love the freak rock phenomena that is Modest Mouse, just can't seem to get behind this release.     +music
Pretty good+P+I'm not usually a fan of "power metal", but this was a pretty good cd all the same.  Some of the songs sound basically the same but there are few that stand out.  Great guitar riff on song 5 The Edge of Paradise. Overall worth buying!+music
Skip it!+N+I hate this music because it is boring, stupid, and downright weak. Let's go over the songs.  1. "The Tide Is High 0/10 I hate this song! Blondie is the worst group in music history.  2. "Dancing Queen" 0/10 I hate Abba to no end!  3. "I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself" 0/10 I hate Dusty Springfield until armageddon comes. I hate this album because it does not have any music of the macabre, sinister, and devilish. So if you want music then look somewhere else, otherwise, stay clear of this mess+music
Brings back alot of good memories+P+Of the songs on the CD Heaven Must Be Missing an Angel was the best.  To dance or roller-skate to it was a blast+music
american music+P+wilder than louise armstrong of the hot 5's, more adventurous than miles davis in agartha, more rock than the millions and millions of american garage bands since 1960.  i was there.  this is it+music
Silver's Ode to Japan+P+As the review below states, "The Tokyo Blues" is one of Horace Silver's best albums.  But with all due respect to Mr. Jones, let's write reviews that tell the people a little bit more about the CD they are thinking about buying.  Recorded in July 1962, six months after a successful and impressionable tour of Japan, "The Tokyo Blues" is Silver's way of saying thank you for the generous hospitality he received while on the other side of the Pacific.  Each of the disc's five tunes has a title that refers to an aspect of Japanese culture or tradition.  But don't think Silver went so far as to incorporate Japanese music on this album, for this is classic hard bop from one of the master's of the genre.  The band here is the famous Quintet of 1959-63 (Blue Mitchell on trumpet, Junior Cook on tenor sax, Gene Taylor on bass) with one exception -- John Harris Jr. replaces Roy Brooks on drums, who was ill at the time of this session.  While "The Tokyo Blues" may not quite live up to "Song For My Father," it is as good as anything else this quintet cut, including "Silver's Serenade," "Finger Poppin" and "Blowin' The Blues Away.+music
HOLY  WACAMOLE !!+P+how do you know when a production in the music business is awsome? because more than 2 years from its release, people still write and talk about it. Progressive House, House, Deep House. This CD is a MUST HAVE for every person who likes music regardless the type of music.  Global Underground 010 - Danny Tenaglia - Athens does represent what electronic music is all about. If i were to pick up a few CDs for another culture (martians) and let them know what ours is about, this would be one of the ones i would pick+music
Everyone has an off day ... and album.+N+I am a big Brian Setzer fan going back to the Stray Cats. He quite frankly is one of the few artists out there whose music is just fun, lively, and makes you feel "Hey man, this is music". Setzer is as talented on the guitar as Jerry Lee Lewis is on the piano and in my mind no better compliment can be paid to a musician.   Every new iteration of Brian Setzer has been enjoyable: Stray cats, to the Swing of the Dirty Boogie, to the Rockabilly of the Comeback Special, and the superb tribute to sun records.  But, he missed it on this CD. The song writing is silly and sophmoric. I do not expect to find the meaning of life hidden behind the lyrics found in Setzer's CDs but the majority of songs on this CD have all the same elements. Some songs are riddled with rhymes children in the first grade use, and are repeated endlessly. Such as in the song "Bad Bad Girl in a Bad Bad World".   For example here is a small snippet out of the song mentioned before:   She's a bad bad girl in a bad bad world A bad bad girl in a bad bad world It's not her fault she's a bad bad world It's so sad it's a sad sad world She's a bad bad girl in a bad bad world A bad bad girl in a bad bad world It's not her fault she's a bad bad world She's a bad bad, bad bad, bad bad, bad bad girl  What garbage! By the end of the little chorus you just want to give the CD a toss.  Many of his songs are riddled with the disjointed tempo changes found in punk music. Setzer has been able to do this subtly in the past without calling attention to it, but there are a few songs on here that just sound confused. Definately not a Setzer trait.   There has never been a Setzer song that I absolutely cannot stand, until "Really Rockabilly" and "Bad Bad Girl". The first two bad songs he has done on the same disc. There is not one single song on here that compares favorably with any other of his songs that have come before.   I have to mention that I hold Setzer to a very high standard, which until now he has never fallen short of. This CD is still far better than 95% of the crap that is being released in today's market.  To summarize I would encourage Setzer to get beyond this CD, and return to his thrown a top the music landscape+music
Groundbreaking!!!+P+A potentially and stunned melodic death metal album. I'm not considder their best work but this album is their most complete. Incredible melodies, excellent musicianship, stunning guitar riffs. An awesome record by this guys!!+music
Something Different+P+For many people they only think of Mary Martin or Mitzi Gaynor in "South Pacific" so this should be a new and enjoyable experience. I love getting different performers takes on roles that is why I purchase so many different recordings of the same title. This recording sounds remarkable with all the new technology they use to preserve these recordings. It was really great to listen to this because I have heard so much about this limited production so many years ago. I think Florence Henderson is a natural for Nellie Forbush, I think she is a very underrated stage performer and singer.So many people tend to just think of Ms.Henderson as that famous Mrs.Brady role. One shall be quite surprised. Another surprise on this was Giorgio Tozzi his operetic voice brings such depth and masculinity to his role as Emile, it is a perfect match for Ms.Henderson's in their duets. The rest of this cast sounds fine and it is one of Rodgers and Hammerstein's best scores. I think the best things about this recording is that this availability gives people more avenues to enjoy and explore this classic work+music
They did it!+P+Boyz II Men's Coolhighharmony is 1 of the best CD's i ever bought. I LUV IT!!! first, i was only getting the cd for the hit, "End of the road". when i had just got the cd, i listend to the entire thing and soon i wasnt skipping tracks to go to end of the road, i was listening to the whole thing. Every song on this cd is good. its been almost 9 years and i still favor this cd+music
Dont know whats wrong+P+Ive listened to ever possible Sinatra era from Dorsey days to the final Reprise days. His voice never seems to falter like most reviewers claim. It would help if I knew when this cd was recorded, but it really doesnt give any information about the dates of the performances. The whole cd proves why Sinatra is one of the greatest entertainers of all time. Ive heard ever live cd by Sinatra and enjoy all of them. I highly recommend this cd to anyone who enjoys good music. Anyone who gives this album less then a four, need to listen to the cd again. Excellent Sinatra concert!+music
The End of Jennifer Lopez+N+Wow.  I didn't know music could get this bad. I just didn't.  No words can describe how awful this CD is, but criticizing it is too easy.  Let me list the reasons why you should not buy this travesty of an album (even the word "album" is used loosely - at best, this collection resembles a group of theme songs from various C-Grade Telenovela series):  1. THE VOICE :  There is no voice. Granted, JLO was never known for her vocal ability, but having taken vocal lessons and practice from husband Marc Antony, one would think she would sound better, but NO. If anything, Jennifers' weak voice is showcased as being even more weak as she literally whines her way through over an hour of the most godawful caterwauling ever heard this side of the Nanjing Massacre.  2. THE MUSIC :  There is no music. The first single "Que Hiciste" has some Spanish sounding instruments thrown in for that "authentic Mexican experience" (yeah, right), but from then on out, its one disgusting ballad after the other. There is no melody, and at one point, I was wishing that SOME poor B-side from her "On the 6" album would pop up to put me out of my misery. Let it be clear - the music on this is non-existent, and Im not just saying that for effect.  3. THE ACCENT:  JLO is not a genuine native Spanish speaker, but she has definitely worked on her accent. However, its a bit sad when Beyonce's new Spanish version of "Irreplaceable" sounds more authentic than anything on this godforsaken CD. Jennifer sounds very forced and gimmicky here, enunciating her Rs and Ts with gusto and a very misplaced conviction. The efforts only lead to what one can call an overwhelming sense of underwhelmingness (the term has come into existence upon the release of this CD)  Jennifer, what went wrong? You had the best producers (though, when you think of it, Marc Antony's only claim to fame in the US is his horrendous "You Sang to Me") and enough moolah to pull this off. Inexcusable.  More than that, it proves that the global Spanish revolution that sort of began in the late 90s with the Ricky Martin craze, is definitely over. Jennifer is done with, and when I start respecting her lesser, more vapid counterparts such as Thalia, its a sad day indeed.  True Spanish language albums have CLASS stamped upon them - the only shining example of this is 'Fijacion Oral Vol 1' by our girl Shakira. This album still gives me goosebumps two years past its' release.  'Coma Ama Una Mujer' is a failed effort for all concerned. And if you respect music and your money, you will definitely need to look elsewhere for fulfilment.  Vaya con dios, JL+music
SUPA!+P+I picked this cd up after hearing a single freestyle from a mixtape like 2 years before this dropped and knew I had to have it. Im so pleased w/ this album (and all of supas music) that everytime I listen to it I like it a little more. One of those cds you can just pop in and listen till it's over. I just got deadline in the mail today and it's not even in the same league as this album and still better than most cds Ive listened to this year. You can see how he really strives for greatness and is constantly evolving. A true masterpeice and future classic+music
What a girl wants+P+What a Girl wants is a soundtrack with some cheesy music and some poppy princess music, which inbalances it. The music in the movie well fits the scenes that they're in, but it's just very "cheesy" and "princess poppy". Some of the music is very upbeat and some of the music changes your attitude as you listen to that song, giving you a mood the song has. But overall, the soundtrack is pretty worth the listen to.   1. Good Life - Leslie Millis 5/5    2. Out Of Place - Gavin Thorpe  3/5  3. Crazy - Meredith Brooks 3/5   4. London Calling - The Clash  3/5  5. Who Invited You - The Donnas 2/5  6. Long Time Coming - Oliver James 1/5   7. Kiss Kiss - Holly Valance 5/5 8. What's Your Flava? - Craig David 5/5    9. I Wanna Be Bad - Willa Ford 3/5    10. Half-Life - Duncan Sheik  1/5  11. Somebody Stop Me - Erica Rivera 5/5    12. Rock And Roll, Hoochie Koo - Rick Derringer 0/5      13. Greatest Story Ever Told - Oliver James 0/5  14. What's Good For Me - Lucy Woodward 3/5    15. Ride Of Your Life - John Gregory 4/5  Hope you enjoy  Jordan Overall grade* B-  +music
The Best Cd Ever+P+I am 31 - but grew up on country music.  I love all music - but especially older country music.  I love Hank senior Johnny Cash etc.  This CD is one of my very best purchases ever.  I have a large music collection.  If you enjoy his music -this is a must buy.  Don't think twice. The best music is a souls essence released in song+music
no special talent for music+N+If Axiom of Choice have a great talent, it's for getting their music fairly widely known.  But a lot of the music on this cd sounds like an absent-minded jam anyone could have in their garage with a friend.  There's some richer music on this cd, a song or 2, but not really.  For music like this, I recommend other people such as Vas, Rasa, Stellamara, &amp; even Loreena McKennitt+music
Not my thing..+N+Why does this cd not appeal to me? Well, it doesn't have what it takes (in my opinion) to reach inside of me and make me tap my foot to the beat. His previous songs did that. Sure, Will is growing and I hope he continues to grow but this cd was a disappointment to me. I expected more. Should you buy this cd? Sure! If you're a fan of Will then go for it. If you want a totally different style of Will then give it a bash. If you're looking for some upbeat music that will make you bop your head at a party or while driving then I suggest you pick another cd+music
Customer Service+N+The Item you sent me was not the right item. I think?  Then you sent me the same item back to me.? Did ask for knowledge on what the difference was on REISSUE and REMASTER. I could have already purchased this item, REISSUE, at the store down the street for less the amount that I spent at Amazon.  Sorry not a satisfied customer+music
.hack// extra soundtrack+P+This soundtrack comes with the .hack//sign vol.4 limited  edition dvd. The soundtrack has great new versions of tons of songs from the anime. If your colledcting .hack, it is a must have.+music
Burn, burn, yes you gonna BURN!+P+From all the other reviews, you can pry tell what they sound like so I will just rate the songsw with my opinion  Bombtrack--5/5---Hard rockin with some damn good rappin mixed in  Killing in the Name--5/5---When you listen closely, you can hear the message, put in an amazing rock hit.  Take the power back--5/5---Funky, enjoyable, rockin, what more do you need. Some great riffs in this  Wake Up--4/5---Don't listen to this song very often because you wont want to hear it too much.  Settle for nothing--1/5---terrible, slow with too much goddamn screaming. The one song by this band that I hate  Know you enemy--5/5---funky rock.rap song that is a lot of fun to listen to  Bullet in your head--4/5---Great bass lines, but a little annoying with too much screaming  Wake up--4/5  Fistful of steel--5/5  Township rebellion--3/5--- a little annoying, but fun for a little while  Freedom--5/5---Great album close+music
Perfect!+P+Now this is very good. A CD set with some of the best post-punk material to come out of Liverpool and Manchester. there is unfortunately some great overlap with the Martin Hannett story CD but this set is overall more satisfying since it is more varied and also contains more stuff as well as a few rarities that everybody will appreciate. Indeed, in additioon to Buzzcocks, the Fall and New Order, which were obvious choices there are also some old favourites like Ludus, Crispy Ambulance and Big in Japan that merit to be heard. If you are interested in thie very special period in british music history then this is an essential acquisition.+music
Great album, well worth $15.00 or more+P+Ok, well I have to admit that I am as much a fan of the guitar sounds as I am Adam Duritz's voice. I would have rated this as a five star album, yet every once in a while (on maybe two or the songs total) Adam will get caught up in some moment singing and the dud gets kind of whiny. This guy is one of the best singers on the planet, though and this cd is still one of the best that the Counting Crows have ever produced. Okay, well, the guitar sounds are much more raw, very retro and vintage sounding, I wouldn't be suprised if every guitar, amp, and effects pedal are 30+ years old. My favorite songs are definitely Raining in Baltimore (amazing quiet version), Long December, Have You Seen me Lately?, Recovering the Satelites, and Round Here. If you like retro music with strong raw vocals you should love this stuff. I've heard Adam's voice coompared with Rob Thomas of Matchbox 20. Although I would say that they are very unique I admit that for comparison they are simalar in style (Adam's better though). I hope you like the album. Enjoy+music
Welcome back, Sonny.+P+In 1962, it had been three years since Sonny Rollins had released a record.  Frustrated with what he felt was his own limitations, he took sabbatical to work on his form, practicing at the Williamsburg Bridge.  This odd habit led to his comeback album being named "The Bridge".  A quartet record featuring guitarist Jim Hall, bassist Bob Cranshaw, and drummer Ben Riley, invariably this album and it's story is the stuff of legends, and deservedly so.  Rollins is on fire throughout-- playing mostly standards (with only two originals), it sounds as if he was itching to get in the studio again, his playing is powerful, focused ("Without a Song"), lyrical (one of the definitive readings of "God Bless the Child") and emotive ("Where Are You?").  Rollins' support is generous and sympathetic, particularly on "God Bless the Child", where Cranshaw in particular feels like he's breathing in time with Rollins.  All in all, a worthwhile effort, and an essential point in Rollins' catalog.  It also may be the best place (either this or "Saxophone Collosus") to begin exploring Rollins' catalog.  Highly recommended+music
Love the band, not the record.+N+Gotta go with the folks who are DBT fans but think they missed a step on this one. Yeah, "February 14" and "Gravity's Gone" are good tracks, but other than that it's pretty forgettable. I'm especially bummed by Jason Isbell's tunes - what the heck happened? The tracks he wrote for "Dirty South" and "Decoration Day" were far and away the best songs on amazing records. Now he sounds like a Doobie Brother or something equally silly.   C'mon guys, get it together! +music
best Cacus release Barely Contained/ The Studio Sessions +P+After churning out psychedelic sludge with Vanilla Fudge, bassist Tim Bogert and drummer Carmine Appice joined the blues-rock gold rush of the early '70s. Entertaining in a Spinal Tap way, Cactus spew fantastic riffs as strutting metalhead Rusty Day plays badass frontman. "Rockout, Whatever You Feel Like" is a best song of the ages.best album in years fantastic best as it gets+music
The Furnaces never met a midi plugin they didn't like+N+"Teach Me Sweetheart" and "Waiting To Know You" get a lot of play around my parts. Likeable, but heavy on the weirdo synth sounds. Ease off the Pro Tools knobs man+music
One Good Song And Lots Of Filler!.+N+Like other reviewers of this CD I bought it because I liked the song Livin La Vida Loca which is played a lot on radio stations and to be honest it's the only song I like on this CD! The other songs just don't appeal to me. He is a good singer though+music
Deep goes Shallow+P+This is a good collection but I think the previous albums are better. There are a couple of nice tracks but you can feel something missing in most of them. All in all a worthwhile buy if you are a big fan, like me ;+music
Dope+P+Dope CD, I liked it, some phat beats and lyrics, everyone does a good job on this CD. Didnt like I couple of songs, but apart from that I loved this+music
Don't get your hopes up+N+I was very excited when I finally received this CD because of all of the great reviews. I listened to the first song- it was good. I listen to the third- it was okay. By the time I reached the very end, I realized all of the songs sounded the same except for one.  The music is mostly composed of the traditional rock guitar with a combination of techno sounds. The melodies have been slightly changed, and some have a slower tempo than the originals. I don't mind any of these things. The problem I had was with their lack of a variety of different instruments and styles. All of the songs are semi-hard rock with techno sounds from late 80's music (I can't stand those cheesy saxophone sounds).   I wish they added a few vocalists to the music, used a combination of styles, and not try to fill every second with a barrage of sounds. I suggest you buy a couple songs, but not waste your money on buying the whole CD+music
Harry Potter 3+P+Still haunting and mysterious just as the first two, this would have to be my most favorite out of the Harry Potter installments. Each track on this soundtrack gives you a clear idea of how the movie is like in your head, having the same theme of the last two movies, but making it more eerie and more amusing to listen to it. Having loud tracks, some tracks are beautiful; such as Track 6 and Track 15. I'm very happy that most of the tracks are over 2 minutes long, not having to change the track in like a minute and able to enjoy the melodic score. John Williams is an excellent composer. I highly recommend this to anyone!   1. Lumos! (Hedwig's Theme)  5/5 2. Aunt Marge's Waltz  4/5   3. The Knight Bus   4/5  4. Apparition on the Train  5/5 5. Double Trouble  5/5 6. Buckbeak's Flight  5/5   7. A Window to the Past  5/5  8. The Whomping Willow and the Snowball Fight 5/5  9. Secrets of the Castle  4/5 10. The Portrait Gallery  5/5    11. Hagrid the Professor   5/5  (Sounds Renaissance) 12. Monster Books and Boggarts!  3/5  13. Quidditch, Third Year  4/5 14. Lupin's Transformation and Chasing Scabbers  4/5  15. The Patronus Light  5/5   16. The Werewolf Scene 5/5  (Exciting)  17. Saving Buckbeak  4/5   18. Forward to Time Past  5/5   19. The Dementors Converge  4/5   20. Finale  5/5  21. Mischief Managed!  5/5  Hope you enjoy!   Jordan Overall grade* +music
Top Notch+P+The greatest thing about this LP is the songwriting.  Sexsmith writes songs about overcoming a difficult upbringing, dealing with mortality and being average.  I think he tends to write too many love songs on his other albums but on Other Songs he creates a great diversity and depth.  Mitchell Froom's production is perfect for the songwriting (it's almost as good as Kiko)+music
Fantastic but incomplete+P+By the way, the 'Tumblin' Tumbleweed' version is by 'Roy Rogers & Sons of the Pioneers', not 'Riders In The Sky+music
More like a sophomoric effort+N+I don't know what happened with this effort.  I have yet to stop listening to Hellbilly Deluxe and Sinister Urge.  However,I have listened to Educated Horses (through) once, maybe twice. I just cannot make myself listen to it.  And that is really sad because I love Rob Zombie and his music+music
BEWARE >>>>  total trash !!!!!!!!+N+Don't believe any positive review of this CD - there is not ONE track that is remotely tolerable music.  This is prime, grade AAA, amateur musical trash ...  if considering this CD, do yourself a favor and just flush the money down the toilet so you can skip the agrevation and the shipping costs. In the past I have given "CD reviews" a lot of credence ... NO MORE!!!!  This is foolishness+music
No Why Ruben+N+Ruben Did Not Do This Song Justice. If You Are Going To Cover A Song You Better Do A Better Job Then The Origal. If You What To Hear Flying Without Wings Song Like It Should Be Check Out Westlife+music
On Par with XI, X-factor in Maidens mediocre second coming+N+Lets get 1 fact out: IRON MAIDEN DOESNT CARE ANYMORE!!!  How can they be SO brilliant with # of the beast, Piece of Mind & PowerSlave & then put out 5 terrible records in a row starting with X-factor?  This record is soooo boring! I bought it based on Wickerman which I found to be OK, reminiscent of  the old Iron Maiden & then they just ran completely out of material. Track 2 on sounds exactly the same, long boring slow tunes that never end.. going track after track, album after album. Does "Dream of Mirrors" ever end? I cant ever tell.. I just lose my attention due to its such a GD drag. Then they hit me with "Thin Line" which is even less interesting than the most boring professor I had in the most boring class in my entire college career.   You cant listen to the original "Iron Maiden" release & then seriously listen to this new crap & release it, unless you just dont care. Obviously they dont CARE!! This record is TERRIBLE!  If they did care they would relisten to the first 6 or so & rethink thier efforts & either improve the sound or just end Iron Maiden & come out with a new band named "Too old, too tired!" & quit defiling the great name of "IRON MAIDEN"+music
very hard+N+unlike other more chill travis discs like "the man who" and "invisible band," this cd is really pretty heavy.  I gave the cd away to a buddy of mine who likes hard rock and he loves it.  This is not a cd to put on and relax to+music
Supurb and Deserving Tribute+P+I'm also 33 years old but my parents actually had the LP of this great album.  (What's a CD?)  However it's been collecting dust for 25 years since it's too worn out to listen to.  Plus, where is that darned old record player anyway!  After recently acquiring this LP on CD, trust me, you'll be glad to hear this fine &quot;tribute to the best&quot; in true 21st century hi-fi sound (CD quality).  Oh yeah, the songs are all good to, but I've loved this album since the '70s. Ahh Haa+music
Greatest Modest Mouse Album+P+This is by far Modest Mouse's best album. It is hard for most people to understand at first. This album has a whole different feel to it than the rest of their albums. This was the first Modest Mouse album I ever heard, and I couldn't get into it and didn't want to at first. But a friend convinced me to sit through it 3 or 4 times, and now I can't get enough of it. Do yourself a huge favor and buy this album. Close your eyes and listen to it all the way through one or twice, and if you still don't like it, you have poor taste in music and you suck. If you love this album like I do, you'll also love the Ugly Casanova album titled Sharpen Your Teeth. Another great Modest Mouse album is The Fruit That Ate Itself+music
go listen to real blues+N+basically... kenny wayne is one of the worst excuses for a blues guitarist ive ever seen. i mean sure hes got a little speed but he's pathetic in comparison to pretty much any other guitarist out there! seriously he can't even solo over chord changes! i've heard him compared to the likes over SRV. whoever thinks that is plain deaf. if you want some real hard hittin blues guitar.. go listen to stevie ray, freddie king, albert collins or johnny winter. i feel bad for any music fan who wastes their money on this cd+music
Distubed rocks-just not this time.+N+I love the other disturbed albums-this one though is somthing of a letdown. with the exeption of "liberate" its the same tune from begining to end.   Not great.   I love ten thousand fists though that whole album is teriffic+music
The price is right.+N+I am not sure why this compilation garnered such high scores so far. Maybe because I am into a different brand of dnb, but the tracks on this CD are among the least musical pieces of noise I have heard, with rare exceptions. The beats are rather cliche dnb, which in itself is not too bad. The deep sub-basslines sound great production-wise, but the patterns are often nonsensical.  Generally, if you like very repetitive hard and fast dnb with powerful bass and sinister yet musically simplistic soundscapes, then by all means, get this cd. However, if you expect something fresh, clever, or something that has at least a little bit of musical value, look elsewhere. This is not Roni Size, Aphrodite, or Pendulum. This is dumbed-down Dieselboy+music
Her voice is much like Trisha Yearwoods+P+I absolutely love this album!!!  1.) Strong Anything 4/5  2.) No End In Sight 5/5  3.) The Breakup Song 4/5  4.) I Want A Cowboy 5/5  5.) Unbreakable 5/5  6.) Flowers By The Side Of The Road 2/5 ( I don't like songs like this.) 7.) Drop Dead Gorgeous 5/5  8.) Normal 4/5  9.) I Won't Say Goodbye 5/5( My Favorite song on the album)  10.) Home Running Away 4/5  11.) Prelude To The Kiss 4/5  +music
wonderful+P+I loved this Cd by Enrique Iglesias.  I was never a big fan of his until I heard this CD.  The music was so beautiful.  I didn't really know what the songs were about because I do not know much Spanish, but the songs moved me.  Some of them were so beautiful I wanted to cry.  This Cd is well worth the money of buying+music
Disappointment+N+This CD Was uttely boring it sounded like Dianne didn't even care that she was singing. It was a disappointment to me becuase she usually is pretty excting. I felt like she didn't do enough to make this CD perfect. I mean if it was just a regualar person putting out their very first CD, it wouldn't sound like this, becuase it wouldn't sell! Okay so, I have to give it 2 stars becuase at times it sounds relazing and nice, but then I think that every Christmas CD should be as excting as Christmas really is+music
BEAUTIFUL+P+What a warm gift.  Thanks Faith!!  This CD was well coordinated and crafted.  The kind of CD you bake cookies, cut greens, make pies, kiss and hug family, kids, while playing. +music
Amazon Did A Very Poor Job In Advertising This Product+N+I know that this CD set is great, that is why I ordered it. I however got an e-mail after I had already ordered the item that I found on the website saying they refunded my money because the price was wrong and the "quality of the item wasn't good." What sort of bad advertising is that? It isn't my fault that they priced it wrong, and if there was a mistake I should have received it anyway. It isn't fair, and I want everyone to know that they obviously did not do their jobs in making sure all of the information was correct to be displayed on the website.+music
&quot;Everything is Possible&quot; but don't buy everything+N+What drugs do I need to take to make this sound good? So many raved about this group so I bought a cd. Big mistake, HUGE. I'm such a sucker+music
Just a stunning collection of great songs+P+If someone were to rush up to me and hold a gun to my hand and insist that I recommend one and only one Jesus & Mary Chain album to someone completely unfamiliar with their music with the proviso that it be THE album that would bring that person the most enjoyment, I would be in a complete quandary (though why some insane person would be wielding a pistol in such a nutty undertaking I won't speculate about).  On the one hand, PSYCHOCANDY is unquestionably their masterpiece, not merely a great album, but one of the great precursors of the emergence of alternative music in the nineties.  Yeah, alternative went pop when Nirvana hit it big with NEVERMIND in 1991, but the Jesus & Mary Chain had already copped all the right attitudes and struck all the right chords with PSYCHOCANDY in 1985.  With that album they go down with the Velvet Underground, Television, and Big Star as bands that wield an influence vastly in excess of their collective record sales.    But as great as PSYCHOCANDY is, I'm not sure that 21 SINGLES:  1984-1998 doesn't have better songs.  The collection of singles pulls together not merely the very best songs off PSYCHOCANDY, but a host of great songs off other albums that either weren't as good or weren't very good at all, but nonetheless had a couple of great individual cuts.  For instance, back when I was collecting Jesus & Mary Chain discs, I stopped with PSYCHOCANDY, DARKLANDS, and BARBED WIRE KISSES, two albums and an anthology.  This means that I missed out on some really great cuts that are collected here.  For instance, I was completely blown away by "Head On" the first second I heard it, but because I didn't get AUTOMATIC, it was completely new to me.  Same thing is true of "Blues from a Gun," the very scary "Reverence," "Sometimes Always" (with guest lead vocal by Hope Sandoval of Mazzy Star), and the wonderful pair of cuts from MUNKI, "I Love Rock N Roll" and "I Hate Rock N Roll."  These are just great songs, and they really make me regret that I stopped my collecting of their music when I did.    So, I truly hope gun-toting maniacs stay away from me, but if saner, more everyday folk want who are unacquainted with one of the great bands of the eighties and nineties want to dive into their music, I would strongly recommend both PSYCHOCANDY and 21 SINGLES: 1984-1998.  This music is as crucial as anything that arose during the period+music
Big Time Label Debut+P+Yea, it's all about the sellout but who cares.  The first song on this album spews acidy alien blood and tears @ss from there.   Paul Leary is quite underrated and Gibby Haynes finally decided to quit being weird without a cause. But they still have a lot of weirdness and that's where some of the filler comes in, but then I never even skip past the German guy.  Bloodlust said everything I needed to say but I'll just back it up- this album is blistering space rock, like Kyuss with the muffler blown off and sped up during the best parts and slowed down at times but all the while complemented by jibberish vocals.   Dust Devil is one of my top 5 favorite songs ever written.  "Got the power of an upright in his g****m hand! Bahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.  Bahaaaaaaaaaaaaa!+music
sonny's back!!+P+i haven't finished listening to this cd, it's playing as i type now. much that i've heard lacking in a lot of recordings from the late 70s when mr rollins seemed to be exploring a more popular sound for younger audiences has been recaptured and reshaped, that tone and timbre, his big, full sound, the wonderful improvisation, the sly americana references, the calypso blends, it's all here.  and my best regards to the group, bob cranshaw on bass, steve jordan on drums, bobby broom-guitar, kimati dinizulu-percussionist, and to clifton anderson on trombone, who really knows what it's all about+music
Definitely unhinged!+P+Wow! Can you handle derangement recorded on tape? The riffs are tremendous, and the mix is insidious and evil. And then there's Mr. Yow. He's just on another planet+music
TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT+N+i have awaited the release of this particular Art of Noise LP onto cd for 20 years. this title was my all-time favorite Art of Noise record. upon opening up the cd & quickly jumping to track 2 - "Beat Box" only to find out it has been replaced by the version that appeared on "Who's Afraid of The Art of Noise". you can imagine my disappointment! i thought for sure after 20 years i would finally have the original break dance classic of "Beat Box" in the digital format. Anyway, being a true Art of Noise fan for many years, this was definately a let down+music
Sacrilege to compare with 80's legend bands.+N+To compare this with the Smiths the Furs and the Cure..? is a sacrilege. It is far from those bands, not remotely in their league, and not even close to their sound..  Its lite bouncy uninspired pop. Which is fine, but please be honest with musical comparisons, perhaps listen to the refered bands before using them as a reference+music
Dissapointed+N+I was dissapointed when I listened to this cd.  All I wanted was the original version of the Perfect Drug.  This cd only has the remixes.  So if you're buying this cd for the original version, you should just as well buy the soundtrack for the Lost Highway instead+music
Good Christmas Classics+P+Loved the movie, really like the CD. It's good music that makes you remember the movie. Perfect addition to a holiday music collection+music
Every track takes you 'across the pond'+P+You will not be disappointed by this delightful album!  This may be  sacrilege, but the Chieftains can get old after a while (well, they ARE  old)...and Altan is certainly a breath of fresh air.  These folks know what  they're doing, and you can hear it in their whimsical reels.  I look  forward to getting more of their stuff.  Highly recommended+music
Really a 4.5...+P+Very solid release that lacks the radio friendly songs that made Cracker Soul &amp; Kerosene Hat college favorites.  Overall i found the guitar work to be great, same good lyrics and much better vocals from Lowery.  A more creative effort than Gentleman's Blues with less screaming.  I don't know if i agree that this disc has shades of Camper Van Beethoven but this release does remind me more of their first effort Cracker Soul+music
Simply one of the finest albums you'll ever encounter+P+It is almost impossible for any album on Amazon to receive nearly a hundred reviews and still get an overall 5 star rating, yet DIFFERENT CLASS has managed to do just that.  Although Pulp has several really good albums, this is their best in my opinion.  It isn't just that the songs are musically compelling; lyrically the songs are frequently and unexpectedly complex.  When this album was first released in England it was one of the rare times when an album achieved simultaneously intense critical and popular acclamation.  Critics declared it a masterpiece, and fans bought it in astonishing numbers.  The album also is deceptively political, in that it features class difference in a large number of songs.    There are many musical highlights on the album, but what I find most remarkable is that there are several songs so good it makes the other songs seem bad in comparison, while one song in particular makes even the other great songs suffer in contrast.  Fans will always differ on their favorites, but few will question that the album starts off strongly with "Mis-Shapes."  "I Spy" is one of my favorites on the album along with "Disco 2000," which follows it.  "Sorted for E's and Wizz" is another stunner.  But seriously, all the songs on the disc are at least good, most are very good, and two or three are great.  But the best of the bunch is unquestionably "Common People."  "Common People" is simply a great song on multiple levels.  Musically it is incredibly compelling, one of those tunes that once you hear it you can't get it out of your head, with an upbeat tempo that makes you want to get up and dance around.  But this would merely make it a good song; what makes it great is the story the song tells.  An art school student is noticed by a fellow student, a rich girl from Greece, who declares to him that she wants to learn about what it is like to live as one of the common people.  There is a definite sexual come on, as she says that she wants "to sleep with common people, like you."  At this point you think you know where the song is going, to a nice if somewhat standard narrative of two people from different classes who have a romance despite it all.  But the song instantly takes you in a different tangent.  What follows is as extraordinary as it is unexpected.  Our hero takes the girl to a supermarket and asks her to imagine being there with no money, a notion she laughs at.  At this point the song turns very serious and dark, as he tears into her for her calloused desire to slum and make a game out of taking on a mode of life that is for others a fairly desperate affair.  He tells her that if she is laying in a bed watching roaches on the wall she can just call her dad and her problems would be over, but to truly find out what it would be like to live like "common people" would mean learning what it means to have no choices, no outs, no control.  He sings:  You will never understand How it feels to live your life With no meaning or control  So instead of the song of romance and love that we think we are getting at the beginning, we get an impassioned condemnation of anyone who would make light of the struggles of those who are less well off.  I know of no other song like it.  Pulp has done a number of really fine albums and a host of great songs, but this song has to go down as one of my all time favorites.  It definitely goes onto my all time Top 40.  There are four Pulp albums that I think any serious music fan should own:  HIS 'N' HERS, DIFFERENT CLASS, THIS IS HARDCORE, and WE LOVE LIFE.  If one were bound and determined to own only one Pulp album, one might go with HITS, but this DIFFERENT CLASS is so good that I just can't imagine anyone not wanting this and others as well.  Trust me:  if you don't own this album you need to get it today.  Your ears will thank you+music
Even in his 50s, he's still THE rock-musician+P+Say what you want about Bruce "getting old", but I strongly believe that this album (which showcases Bruce in his late-40s/early-50s) puts many rockers half-his-age to shame.  All the songs are great, especially the ones that are re-arranged, such as "The River."  For a special treat, Bruce throws in the rarity, "Don't Look Back."    And yet, of all the songs on this live album, I believe the most impressive is Bruce's acoustic version of "Born in the U.S.A.", where Bruce plays an acoustic 12-string.  For those of you who have Tracks, but not this, trust me when I say LINYC's version of "BITUSA" makes Tracks' acoustic version look like nothing.  ONE WARNING: Though I personally have no qualms about the song-selections, some of you who want to hear the "staples" (i.e. "The Promised Land") might be dissapointed.  And yet, when it comes to preferences of Bruce-fans, the term "to each his own" is definetely applicable.  Is it an extensive treasure-trove of live performances a la Live 1975-1985?  No.  Is it worth it nonetheless?  Yes+music
Na Na Na Na Na Na+P+I'm listening to NOW 19 right now!!!!!! I love the fact that NOW puts the latest cool songs onto one  GREAT CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! For Christmas I'm getting Now 20!!!!!!+music
Nothing on Raw Like Sushi matches "Buffalo Stance"+N+I just recently heard "Buffalo Stance" on my local college radio station, and it brought back memories of the first time I heard it in back in the winter of 1989. It isn't difficult to see why this song was so popular back then; it had all the infectious grooves an excellent pop song should have. But there's a problem with the overall album of Raw Like Sushi: all the songs that surround "Buffalo Stance" don't even come close to matching its catchiness. Even the inexplicably praised "Manchild" is dull.   Find the single for "Buffalo Stance" if you can, and pick up a Salt & Pepper album as an alternative to Raw Like Sushi.  +music
Another disappointment from MoS+N+Although you get alot of songs for $25, you get a lot of garbage which has been typical from MoS in the past two years.  The best songs are from the album that features hits from the past.  You can't really go wrong there.  You'd be better downloading the 10 good songs from iTunes and saving $15+music
I really want a Constantine CD...not this.+N+I didn't buy the CD...I couldn't make it past the samples. I loved Constantine on Idol. I didn't think he was the best there, but I thought he was near the top. Performance wise though, this guy can perform on stage...I just love him. This music though, not impressed. I understand why he would want to promote his original band, but he really needs to give it up and go out on his own. He did so good on Idol and had so many fans. Granted, I'm sure some will buy this CD just because they are a fan. And I'm sure that there are some that will love it. I'm not one of them though. I really wanted to like it, but I just can't. That said though, I would really like to see the Constantine from Idol make his own CD. Now that one I would buy+music
just bad+N+CONSTANTINE MAROULIS may be easy on the eyes, but thei s cd is awful.  A bit to hardcore for a debut albumn.  Maybe payback for not getting further in AI, I really think he can sing and does have talent, when he did David Cassidy's I THINK I LOVE YOU, it was a good take on a old 70's song. Then when he did Queens Bohmeian Rhaposdy it sent shivers down my bones, (no Freddy) but not bad. Sorry this is just a disappointment, better luck next cd.  This may have been a let down  to his fans, not to mention that AI  has a large pre teen audience not to mention how many parents would go out and buy this cd, for it surely would have a explicit warning label on it+music
Good house music does not equal good music+N+2 1/2  Competent though disappointing, this highly referenced trance album cannot escape it's plodding, dated backbone of a beat, no matter how refined and professional the production tries to be. Of course, listening to the album 13 years later, one immediately feels the bland, aged thump soaked into the generic sequencing and tonality, which is not to say the album was not worthy of the praise it garnered upon release-in House-centric circles that is. The thudding, ever present, 4/4 layering of a pulse that guides entirely too much mainstream electronic music out there will vastly undermine any of the dreamy atmosphere heavily present on this ambitious little club-hopper, rendering most of the Yanni-with-edge keyboard melodies banal. Thankfully once in a while, particularly at the start and finish of the disc, a semi-potent spell is afforded these static conditions, allowing Dreamland to shine in refreshingly unrestricted ways+music
Not the wonderful Hootie I am used to.+N+I own four other albums and all of them are great.  When I pop in a Hootie CD I expect to be relaxed by the soothing voice and the familiar sound that accompany one of my all time favorite bands.  I buy CD's and keep those CD's on the premise that the entire CD is worth keeping.  I am not buying a CD for one or two songs, but the CD as a whole. I just bought this album the other day.  Half of the songs had the familiar feel but the rest could go to waste.  I am giving it a 2.5, because half the album is great. +music
What a Bigot!!!!!+N+Don't buy songs from this racist bastard!!!! And if he so-call "hates everyone", why does most of his titles of his b-side songs start with the "N" word? Damn hick+music
Just the Real Thing+P+Waterfalls are some of the most primitive things in nature. With this cd, you can't help but think you're right there next to the waterfall. Close your eyes or lie down, and let the natural sounds permeate your mind+music
Christmas with the Rat Pack+P+Great CD for decorating the house.  It was good to hear some of my favorites singing the holiday songs.  It's very nostalgic+music
Always evolving... +P+...while we keep hearing the same all tracks every other DJ/Producer is mixing, Sasha comes with a totally different sound that keeps evolving. Can't wait for his next one, awesome.+music
"The Best Of..."?..As compared to what?+N+This item is billed as "The Best Of " Shatner and Nimoy..Now I really do have to wonder about the use of the word"Best"here...Neither Shatner nor Spock can sing,so this album exists as a goof...But there really isn't anything funny about the material contained on this disc...indeed,since at the time it was recorded both performers took themselves and thier efforts very seriously,the sides on this album were never intended as joke material..The fact that they HAVE become joke material still does not excuse the fact than any of these sides,by either of these two actors,were ever recorded...Now I like a good joke when I hear one,as well as the next guy,and I appreciate comic tunes,but the dull,tedious,often over-wrought balderdash that is to be found on this album stupefies rather than entertains... Getting back to the use of the word"Best" as a descrition of what is contained on this album...If this stuff is the"best" that either man is capable of I can only shudder at the thought of what the stuff left off this compilation must sound like..."Best"...as in The"best"manure the cow has to offer?..As in It's "Best" to shoot oneself in the head rather than endure these tunes?Or maybe "best" as in IT WOULD BE "BEST"TO AVOID WASTING YOUR HARD-EARNED MONEY ON THIS FLAPDOODLE....That is a use of the word "best"that is appropriate....+music
I LOVE THIS ALBUM!+N+That's right, I said it.  I love this album, and yet I still give it two stars.  Let me explain why.    I am rating this album as I would rate any legitimate album.  I do this because I understand that Shatner was being completely serious about this album, and the dramatic interpretations of the two songs/poems/monologues fused together are supposed to symbolize the duality of man, and blah, blah, blah.  I get all of that.  But still, the album is horrendous.  As you listen to it, you cannot help but firmly believe that Shatner thinks he's pulling off some great artistic feat with this album. However, he is wrong.  Horribly wrong.  The arrangement of each "song" is sub-par, the backing band of studio musicians on the album has no life, and then there's Shatner himself.  With his trademark delivery, Shatner leaves his indelible mark all over every track, and that's really not such a good thing.  This album would be utterly forgettable, if not for the fact that it is such a train wreck that it is an absolute must-have.  Let me write that again in bold for the folks that may have skipped over this review:  THIS ALBUM WOULD BE UTTERLY FORGETTABLE, IF NOT FOR THE FACT THAT IT IS SUCH A TRAIN WRECK THAT IT IS AN ABSOLUTE MUST-HAVE.   I actually bought this CD as a British import twelve years ago for twenty bucks, long before it was in print on CD in the States, and even now, when I could have bought it for half the price, it is still worth every penny I paid for it all those years ago.  You see, whenever I'm feeling blue, I pop The Shatner into my CD player, and everything gets a little bit better.  It never fails to bring a smile to my face, especially Mr. Tambourine Man and A Very Good Year.    Honestly, this CD is glorious in it's sheer awfulness.  It is so good on such a low level that it has forced me to create a new word to fully describe it: Shatnerrific.  You cannot go wrong buying this CD.  Trust me on this one.  It's my favorite music purchase ever.  No, seriously.  *Ever*..+music
Awful+N+I would rather buy a plane ticket from him----+music
What lousy packaging!+N+I really enjoyed Bear Family's Robert Mitchum two-fer &quot;That Man&quot; and immediately bought this disc when I saw it. First of all, the content is lighter weight than his other albums. These tracks from his early filmwork are great for the Mitchum fan but someone wanting to actually investigate the man's singing ability should be directed to &quot;That Man&quot; or &quot;Calypso Is Like So&quot;. My complaint (and the reason I didn't give it a higher rating) is the packaging. I thought it was beautiful when I first opened it. A shiny gatefold cardboard package with a clear disc tray and a gorgeous book full of movie posters and a complete filmography with lots of great info. Then the tray fell off of the cardboard backing. Then, the pages started falling out of the book! The whole thing literally fell apart on me! For a pricey import disc such as this, it's totally unacceptable. Maybe I just got a defective one, but I'm not willing to plunk down another 22 bucks to find out. If you feel you must buy this disc, a word of caution: handle with care+music
KRS's weakest entry into his library+N+I have always been a huge fan of Kris Parker.  I like what KRS has done.  I like what he is doing.  I like the fact that he has never looked to what the masses are putting out and has instead tried from day one to promote positivity.  Therefore, I find that this effort is laudable in its attempt to bring KRS's spirituality to an audience that has been listening to him for decades.  Unfortunately, it falls flat on its face.  The songs on this album do not manage to live up to the message in the lyrics.  KRS is best known for bringing a message to all people by writing about things that could be understood by all people.  That aspect of his work is forgotten on this album, and his work comes across as his preaching instead of his teaching.  It's almost like he's forgotten the experiences that brought about his spirituality, and instead focuses on the goal without paying attention to the trials and tribulations that got him there.  Musically, the beats are mostly just plain terrible, and feel devoid of warmth or personality.  The lyrics feel forced and while his delivery is excellent, the writing is not up to his usual high standard.  Most rappers these days are known for the beats they put together, or the hooks of their songs.  Few are known for true lyrical ability.  KRS has never before fallen victim to this trap.  The reason Criminal Minded, Boom Bap and Necessary did so well was the mix of good writing, excellent delivery and beats that worked with the material presented.  Everyone who listens to hip hop can quote lyrics from those albums (and many, if not most, of KRS's other offerings) - the same can't be said with this album, as he didn't find the right mix to present the material.  Pick up this album if you want a complete KRS ONE collection - otherwise, leave it on the shelf+music
Updated Review+N+Now, I realize after taking a closer listen to this album that this album is not a gospel rap album. On ''Know thy self'', Krs claims that there are many ways to god which is downright not true. Krs claims that any ''God'' that's worshipped will lead you to heaven. Think about that, Allah, Buddah, Jesus, Aphrodite all have nothing to do with each other! Only Jesus deserves to be worshipped! Jesus is the son of god, He did die, And he's the only one that rose again so we could all have a chance to enter heaven regardless of our sin [Which every man and woman has]. As for the cd, I won't lie, It sounds really good and even features a few gospel rappers [T-Bone, B.B. Jay], and Krs even makes significant quotes of actual bible verses, But when it comes down to it, Krs still fails to acknowledge that Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life. This cd gets 2 stars from me for the fact that at least Krs is done dissing Jesus [Something he did on every album after ''Criminal Minded'' and every album before ''The Sneak Attack''] and at least he still ain't afraid to expose the problems of this world, But Krs, If you're reading this, I think you're an extremely talented rapper and you truly need to accept Jesus into your heart. Hope the review helped. Be blessed.+music
waste of time+N+yo for any body that buys,listens or even believes a drop of what he says on this album you are is guilty as he is. Go to [...]and see the real truth. By the way that is not my web site for those that think im trying to get a financial plug and i make no funds or get any love offerings for ditributing this info. May God through "the real key" Jesus Christ forgive you and bless you for being so blind+music
Buddha Bar VIII+N+You have Ike Turner and the King of Rhythm as artists for Buddha Bar VIII? If I were to buy this CD? would this be accurate artists?  I would suggest Amazon check their data base+music
More Great Juno Reactor!+P+There are a few tracks that stand out on this album.  Pistolero is fantastic with its spicy Latin sound, and Masters of the Universe is good in the typical way.  The deep throaty vocal samples in the track entitled Badimo are very interesting, and carry a unique vibration.  I wonder what it means...   If you like Juno Reactor, this album is worth a look at least+music
The Anime sound track that never was+P+This is a complete concept album centred around anime and punk classics...  The CD has 13 tracks and clocks in at about 30 minutes this shocked me at first when I put the CD into my pc yet then I realised throughout every minute of the CD it manages to sound fresh no matter how many times you manage to listien to it, this is where the CD'S charm lies in it's bubble gum pop punk rock. It's fun, it's lighthearted it's not serious yet it loves every minute of it ^_^ If you like anime of manga then the packaging will catch you eye immediatly, which is also nice they included the DVD with it so you can see the videos which show off the band's true vision.  If you want some light hearted bubble gum pop punk, or something completly differnt, then you found it. Who thought you could cover the sailor moon theme, sing about captian crunch and cover a punk classic on one album?+music
Come On+N+This live album is well recorded, and the band is the best its ever been. Why only 2 stars? The tracklist! Apart from Can I Play With Madnes (yay!) and Lord of the Flies (yawn), its exactly the same as Rock in Rio, released a couple of years ago, with Dance of Death  instead of Brave New World songs.  Why not play Somewhere In Time, or Wasted Years? Or Futureal (ok Blaze song but still)? or Powerslave? All would have fitted into the theme of the concert well. I don't need to see another version of Hallowed Be Thy Name. Or Wrathchild. Or Fear of the Dark. Or Run to the Hills. Good performance (as expected), but VERY disappointing tracklist+music
bEST CHOICE FOR AMERICA 1995!!!!!! SO REFRESHING!+P+Absolutely a positive influence for our young people!!! I cherish her music, what a wonderful young woman with an amazing voice...whatever she sings!!!  The next best voice of perfection+music
MOST INCREDIBLE+P+Now I do not pretend to know everything there is to know about Tears for Fears...but....I LOVE THIS CD! From START TO FINISH! IT is truely a conceptual masterpiece!  I was fortunate enough to see this performed LIVE in Detroit at St. Andrews Music Hall....incredible band incredible musicians...but ROLAND wrote it all!  He is truely a master...and minus CURT too he is still as good as ever! ITS A DARN SHAME that this did not get airplay and the concert only showed up as a small tiny ad in the corner of the local jam rag...but THE SHOW WAS INCREDIBLE the ALBUM has given to many a spin in my car CD player...it was in rotation there for about an entire year and often times repeated!  References to LENNON and MCCARTNEY are made and i think they are RIGHT ON CUE!  Roland is a true pop genius!  WHO CAN REALLY ROCK OUT TOO! Who ever said POP SONGS had to be boring eh? Just see this band perform one time if you are lucky enough!  Somewhere i see he appologized to Radiohead for playing the song CREEP but i saw him perform it with complete perfection!  The stage was extended with speakers galore and sound equipment to fill a HUGE VENUE in a small tiny club!  The lights and music and show were incredible and this cd is a GREAT one to own! CONCEPTUAL and PERFECTION in a POP RECORD!  GIVE THIS BAND MORE CREDIT!  THE poor website for this album set desolate for more than several years no activity!   Shame ITS A LOW DOWN DIRTY CRYING SHAME .....music has no support for the fine artists such as Tears For Fears...however ROLAND and CURT you have my FOREVER SUPPORT You are BOTH TRUE GENIUS's+music
Just WOW, No words to describe it.+P+Where should I start, Well it was 1997 when my older cousin said let me show you a game. It was of course FFVII, I was BLOWN AWAY by the game. At the time I was 7 years old. I immediatly bought the game and played it straight through.   I always loved the music, it was one of the many fine elements of the game. Nobuo Uematsu did an amazing job with the music he is truly an amazing person, If I saw him walking down the street I would bow before him and kiss his shoes (I bet I'm not the only one who would do that).  Here I am now 15 years old just listened through all 4 (YES FOUR!!!) CD's (which I put on my iPOD. I was blown away, with each song I remember exactly what took place in the game and where I was and what I was doing.   Any fan of FF would love this but even people who never played the series would appreciate it, but if you have played the game straight through you can get the full effect of it.  The price you say may be high but lets do a little math here. All four CD's cost $29.18 now there are 85 songs. Divide and each song will cost about 34 cents, yes 34 cents. You buy songs on iTUNES for 99 cents. It's a great deal, I would pay $100 for this.  If you played FFVII BUY IT!!!!!!!!!If you havn't played FFVII buy the game, it's the best game ever screw Halo 2+music
One Of The Best Jazz/Country Fusion Ever Done - Not Air Head Pop +P+Forget about the pop music of Loggins and Messina. This album is different. This happens to be the best Jazz/Country fusion album ever done. There's great musicianship here. There's EXCELLENT instrumental solos that can take up half of the track as in "Move On". This is superb music that never made it to the radio. These tracks are simply too long to have gotten air play back in the 1970s. L&M put together a truly great album with Mother Lode but not too many people have heard it. Sadly, they broke up shortly after this album was released. Afterwards, Kenny made a come-back by going strictly pop.+music
wow.+P+I have always been quite a hard core Indie fan. I cam across my first Otis Redding song 'Try a Little Tenderness' when I was watching the 80s Teen Flick, Pretty In Pink. It struck me as being one of the most emotional, moving and captivating song I had heard in a long time. It caught my emotions exactly at that moment and now remains a song that is very precious to me. I would like to say thank you to Otis Redding for opening my eyes to different varieties of amazing music, and for creating this incredible album. As someone said before, it is a shame we lost him at such a young age as he had such a unique talent, but i am thankful his music remains to keep his memory forever+music
Best Offspring Album.  An inside review.+P+I have been an Offspring fan for many years.  I have listened to every one of their albums serveral times over and this one has came out on top of all of the rest.  In my opinion, the albums from greatest to least are (not counting their greatest hits album):  1. Ignition 2. Self Titled 3. Smash 4. Ixnay on The Hombre 5. Americana 6. Splinter 7. Conspiracy of One  Note that I am judging the album as a whole, and not just by the best songs.  Ignition has not a single "space filler" song.  It is a raw, 90's punk rock, consistant album.  Some disagree that this is the best of the bunch and argue that Smash is.  I agree Smash has amazing songs like "Self-Esteem", "Come Out and Play", "Gone Away", and many others that helped boost the Offspring to the mainstream.  But not every song on Smash is absolutely good.  "Dirty Magic" is the best song on the CD, if not the best Offspring song of all time.  I think it is overlooked and underrated.  Ignition starts off with Dexter yelling "F**k" and shows you were the album goes from then on.  "Session" is the first song on the CD and one of the top songs of the CD.  There are many great and catchy songs from then on.  Then hits the more emotional, dark, and mysterious song "Dirty Magic".  Then it moves into the drug song on the album which is "Hypodermic".  After that comes the pyromaniac loving song, "Burn it Up".  "No Hero" is also a great example of how the Offsping can turn a simple chug riff into something amazing.  "L.A.P.D." is to Offsping like "F**k The Police" is to N.W.A.  Another catchy song comes after that called "Nothing From Something".  And what better way to end the CD with a great song like "Forever And A Day".  Sure this album is no Sgt. Pepper's, but no one has touched The Beatles.  So I highly reccomend this album to people who have heard the Offspring before.  But if you are just starting to enter the Offspring's world, I would suggest Smash for a better feel.  After you get Ignition and if you really like it, their self titled is right up there with it+music
This band completely copies off Minor Threat!+N+I used to like these guys, but the more songs I hear by Minor Threat and TSOL, the more I realize how the Offspring were just copycats.  What a discrace to punk.  I wish bands like the Offspring, Good Charlotte, Green Day, Blink 182, Simple Plan, and New F@g glory would just (...) off!  The only "American Idiots" are the ones that buy into this boy band poser punk.  "WE'RE JUST A MINOR THREAT!+music
When Christmas was fun!+P+I had this record when I was little so when I saw it out on cd I had to buy it for my kids.  We loved it this holiday season.  It took me way back in time and was just as much fun now as it was then.  All Christmas, every time we got in the car my kids wanted to hear it.  If you like Christmas, you will like this cd.+music
Looking for the closing credits song?+N+The title of that song is "Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen)" by Baz Luhrmann. It is sometimes also called "The Graduation Song." Thought I'd help you all out+music
Not That Good+N+The only song I liked off the soundtrack was The Royal Crown song the rest were kind of bland+music
The Best Jazz Album I've Bought in a Few Years!+P+It's a thrill when a veteran musician puts it all together and every track is a keeper.  Jimmy Smith plays to his strengths (great organ riffs) and gets help from a lot of equally talented friends.  GREAT vocals on this album, sax and guitar.  A real pleasure, among my top jazz albums.  If you you're a long time jazz fan or looking to buy your first jazz album, Jimmy Smith DotCom Blues ought to be on the top of your want list+music
They still got it+P+I'm no longer as ignorant about public policy and processes and the government as I was when I started listening to the likes of "Suffer" and "Against the Grain". Now I don't protest things or show support by voicing my opinions for all to hear or through public action like a pretentious prick, but now I do it by voting and posting crappy reviews. And I don't totally agree with Bad Religion like I used to, but, I gotta hand it to them, they definitely  churned out another great album and I love the songs. "Beyond Electric Dreams", "Los Angeles is Burning", "Sinister Rouge", "God's Love" are all great. I say, you don't have to support the band view on the current issues and whatnot, but show the love for the band and their musical talent+music
More ear candy for lovers of America, Beach Boys, Folgelberg, Eagles, etc...+P+Larson's last two efforts (Watercolor Sky, Sepia) were both outstanding, polished albums with Hank Linderman at the helm.  This album is more "raw" and stripped down in style.  More of Jeff's contemporary edge comes through on Two Part Confessional, as if Linderman is giving him more production input in the final mixes.  "Looking at December" has more of a solo acoustic singer-songwriter sound than we heard before.  "Maybe Cascade Idaho" fully has that Beach Boys/Brian Wilson sound Jeffery Foskett brings to the table and as such, more of a Foskett than Linderman sound. "A Better Day" sounds more like an America song than Gerry Beckley has done in decades, and since he co-wrote and sang strong backing vocals, it really bears his presence well. "The Way Outside" recalls 1973 Eagles/Walsh/Fogelberg ballads, which Linderman has successfully duplicated with his production style. "Play Through" has a AAA radio sound to it, with expressive acoustic guitars and simple tight e.guitar, drums & bass.  "Only Green" is a beautiful ballad (i.e. Souveniers), and the electic guitar production is remeniscent of Bruce Gaitsch (Richard Marx, Timothy Schmit) on some of his solo work.  A surprise addition comes after the end, as a short instrumental ensues, no doubt the type of thing that usually winds up on the cutting room floor.  All in all a very satisfying group of songs, not a bad one in the lot, which I find amazing in today's music. +music
Laughable...+N+After the nu-metal ship sunk, Dez got rid of Coal Chamber (another terrible band) and started this awful band to keep the paychecks flowing.  In doing this, he's making us think he's a death/black metal fan, but I know that he's nothing more than a run-of-the-mill trend-hopper.  Now to the music, it's lame, watered-down "metal" made for the kids who listen to Trivium, Slipknot, and Korn.  Listen to Kreator's "Enemy of God" for a WAY better metal album from 2005+music
Excellent Heavy Album+P+DevilDriver really improved with the release of their dynamic sophomore album "The Fury of our Maker's Hand". This CD is excellent. The guitar riffs are amazing, and Dez Fafara is definitely unique with his vocals. The tracks vary in speed, whether it's the up-tempo of "Hold Back The Day" or "Driving Down the Darkness", or the doomy "Sin and Sacrifice". "Grinf**ked" is definitely the standout track and a definite anthem. Recommended if you like it heavy.  P.S. This isn't "brutal death metal". Brutal death metal is stuff like Devourment, Saprogenic, Gorgasm, etc. Just so that you know.+music
This is only for the die hard fans!+N+If you have never heard Mecano before, DO NOT BUY THIS ONE. The new songs are garbage at best. And even as a greatest hits collection, this fails. Buy all of the albums except this one. The best albums to buy for a new listener are &quot;entre el cielo y suelo&quot; and &quot;descanso dominical&quot;. This features 7 new tracks, 1 remake, and 22 of the classics (but they left off several of their all time greatest like &quot;cuervas de esa chica&quot; y &quot;laika&quot; y &quot; el cine&quot;). I give it 2 stars because I have so much respect for the work they've done in the past. But this was a really lame production+music
Stinks+N+Steve Perry came thru good, but the instrumentation was lousy, and this is remastered! Pfoohey! My vynyl is better. I want my money back. Don't think I'll buy Legacy products again+music
Seriously, what happened to these guys+N+These guys haven't put a good album out since Floored.  Lemonade and Brownies is a great metal album and by far their best.  Once &quot;Fly&quot; was a hit, it ruined their sound and they completely sold their souls and sold out their old fans.  When I heard the first single off this album, I almost cried to see how low this band has gone.  I can't believe Mark McGrath was in that Angel's Song for Sevendust.  Now there's a metal band that still puts out good hard albums+music
Missed Opportunity!+N+A missed opportunity by Bruce Springsteen to produce Live Box-Set Two. Unlike "Live 1975 to 1985", he could of balanced the ledger from his first live project with a much better selection from the final ten shows at Madison Square Garden 2000. At this stage in his career it would not be important to master a selection of live takes from different dates and venues. Instead, a vast repertoire of his music was performed at this one venue, according to the set lists of these ten shows. If Bruce saw this and implemented it, this could have set the record straight with his fans and the bootleggers. A fan's dream I suppose. Otherwise a poor live CD capitalizing on the margin of time it took to release the much better DVD product. It is obvious that some of the most important live songs were included as an afterthought.  I have no problem with Bruce's politics but I am disappointed with the quality of his recent releases on CD. In the end, this is what matters most to me as a fan of the Boss.      +music
sympathique review+P+This cd is incredible.  I love their style and the vocals are superb! I will continue to purchase more of their music.+music
Mr. Mrs. Smith+P+When this CD came out, I ordered it immediately, without watching the movie first. Since I live in Holland and the movie wasn't out here yet. I'm a huge fan of John Powell's scores and I'm glad (again) I bought this score.   The score sounds a little bit like 'The Italian Job' with a spanish flavour to it, because of the percussion and the accoustic guitars. Although the tracks are new and refreshing, I found out that small pieces of music in the film are not on the cd. Like: the 'house fight' part with al the percussion instruments. It's on the cd ('Kiss and Make Up - I believe), and it's a brilliant piece of percussion, but it's not the same as in the movie (that sounded better to me).   Second: the cd is a little on the short side. The total play length of the soundtrack is only 44 minutes. A lot of tracks (20) all relatively short, but... different. So you'll get a lot of different tracks swinged at your ears without to much repeating melody's. Something to get used to after listening to the more monotone Bourne Identity soundtrack.  Nevertheless a brilliant soundtrack, a must have for the John Powell score fans!  (sorry for the dutch-english) grtz, from Holland+music
Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go!!+P+Make It Big is one of the two WHAM! albums with the other being Music From the Edge of Heaven. Of all the three albums released by WHAM!, Make It Big is the better one of the three. With three number one hits including "Careless Whisper", Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go" and "Everything She Wants". Another song that made the top 5 is "Freedom" ranking at #3. All of the songs on the album r my favorites so i don't have a clear cut favorite. Everyone else haz said wut i wanted to say so there's no use in repeating it except thta i HIGHLY EMPHASIZE that if u r an 80s music lover or love to listen to pop in particular, then u MUST get this album+music
CLAP YOUR HANDS SAY REVERB+N+PRODUCTION SUCKS THE LIFE OUTTA THIS RELEASE. GIVES ME A HEADACHE. WHINING, WHINING...THE VOCALS ARE REAL PATHETIC. SAVE YOUR MONEY+music
Pull my finger...+N+See above for reviews that pinpoint some of the problems with this album.  Production quality (or uniquely bad production choices), lack of musical enthusiasm, appalling lack of catchy tunes or lyrics from a band I thought had true capabiities --pick the flaw that bugs you the most.  Any way you slice it this album is a stinker.  Better luck next time CYHSY.  (Your first album was gold.)  Consumers: make sure to listen to those samples before you buy this one.  If you are looking for more great songs like the ones on their first effort then this isn't it.  I'm convinced that the band knew what they had made this time around and that the title, "Some Loud Thunder," must be a witty, veiled reference to flatulence.   +music
Awesome collection of a variety of Bossa Nova!+P+This is a very good collection I stumbled across and has the original (and pretty much best) versions of all the hits - and I disagree with the last reviewer who cited &quot;Chega de Saudade&quot; as being bad without the  lyrics - it's one of my favorites and is such a perfect tune that it needs  no lyrics!  Get this album if you are even slightly interested in Bossa  Nova - it has quickly become one of my staples..+music
Disappointment+N+I liked very much the film Black Orpheus, but when I bought this record I hoped to listen the music, not the movie. Most of the tracks has sounds of the movie overimposed to the songs, as would be heard in the movie. Then why not buying the movie? When I listen a cd I care about music, that is contaminated in this record.  And doesn't help neither that songs are changed abruptly frequently. Besides, the art of the cover is very poor, dishonors the movie, and the written comments claim that the sounds of the movie are a plus, recalling the scenes of the movie were the sounds appear, improperly: the "Oh No!" sound of "Frevo" that is commented does not apear in the movie as said.  As a summary, Verve did wonderfull editions of jazz, but this edition falls far behind the standards of both Verve and the film; clearly, Brazilian music doesn't seems to be Verve territory judging buy this edition+music
great concert+P+this warts and all is much better than warts and all volume one..the highlights include a 25 minute version of Kids, a very good timmy tucker and some other extended jams which were good as hel+music
Reeves at his best+P+If you are tired of the usual guitar playing, with all its already extremely used ways, but don't want to give up listening rock'n'roll, you really should get this album. Not only a guitar player, but also a  songwriter growing after each work, he can give you rock at the best level,  and at the same time showing something new, that will not sound strange to  your years. That's a difficult task you have to admit. And if you think  that this is all, you should get his last online album &quot; Ulysses  (della notte)&quot; even better than this+music
terrible+N+this was the worst music that sounded like david bowie.  i can't believe these guys have even gotten a record deal....oh the humanit+music
~A STEP BACK~+N+Daz Nigga Daz & Kurupt the Kingpin are clearly gone. When you hear quality material like "Dogg Food" and then switch to this "Saga" CD... One has to wonder where the effort went?  It's always a treat to see Daz and Kurupt together doing stuff. They've accomplished a bit on solo projects and dualing on other albums. But this one was a rush-to-the-studio. Daz- has he changed this much? His talent levels have kept him bringing stylish beats in the past- very jazzy, funky with many instruments felt. That's all gone now..... Now it's bass, bass, bass with lost chorus direction and no style.  Daz's delivery isn't even what it use to be. The pitch is very high all the time, even if the production doesn't call for it. Kurupt back in the studio on this one is nice. But we get a lost focus with so many destractions. And what's clearly missing is the other lineups- no Soopafly, Snoop, Nate, Mr. Malik, Bad Azz... so forth. I know, I know that DPGC album is coming out to reveal that all. Well Daz & Kurupt should've waited instead of damaging their album archive.  Album had a couple of nice ones. Overall, not at the level of their capability..+music
.........cosmic+P+I guess "Bible of Dreams", Juno Reactor's bold foray into territory beyond their techno days, contains the best sounds. Aw, who am I kidding? It's the greatest album in the history of the universe!!!  1) Jardin de Cecile - 4/5. You might call it boring; I call it moody. This is not the standard "calm & slow" sound of Juno Reactor--in other words, it's not a droning, monotonous pile of neverending bull. This one actually has character, which is maybe not as evident in the first couple of minutes as it is later. We get some atmospheric, echoing notes that have a nice, dreamy quality to them. After a while, percussion joins in, along with this weird "sweeping" noise that pops in every few seconds. About five minutes in, the song undergoes a complete change of style and transforms to heavy percussion and a little synth. A nice intro that gives you a taste of things to come. It's like the POV of someone gradually waking up and joining the traffic jam of everyday life. While stoned.  2) Conga Fury - 4/5. You may have heard this in "The Animatrix" or "Mortal Kombat: Annihilation" (so sorry for mentioning that movie). It starts off with a lone female voice whose harmonizing is soon joined by jungle drums and synth. It continues on with the drums and the synth and the voice until it quiets down and ends the same way it began. And what's really funny is the male voice that kicks in at two minutes. It's somewhat weird and out of place, but it's so hilarious that I can forgive Watkins. "Huela! Huela! Libalalibalalibalalibala..." Or whatever he's saying.  3) God is God - 5/5. It's funny. When I first heard "Pistolero", I thought that no other Juno Reactor song could ever be as good or better. Kids today, eh? Whatever melancholy quietude existed in the first two songs is completely gone here. We've left the jungle and entered the desert, and does it deliver. Don't be fooled by the spacy sound at the beginning--that soon gives way to a crazy beat with chanting and all the instruments you'd expect in the Middle Eastern culture. There are also sound clips apparently taken from "The Ten Commandments", which are weird at first and then as cool as the rest of the song. Sure, it's repetitive, but the main tune is WAY awesome, and as long as we have that...repetition matters not, grasshopper.  4) Komit - 4/5. Not bad at all. A remix of this was heard early on in "The Matrix Reloaded", and I must admit, I liked it better there. It begins with a series of notes that give one a sense of flying through the calm night air. I would've liked to hear these notes become more prominent, but alas, only in "Reloaded". Here, they stay in the background and let the Juno percussion take over. The song just gets bizarre at times, although the grungy tunes are worth it. That's about all. Overall, this is a more organic version of something you'd hear in "Transmissions".  5) Swamp Thing - 4/5. Ah, looks like they're tackling heavy metal. This starts off grungy and gritty, and doesn't let up until it's over. The usual percussion kicks in, and sticks with a sinister tempo for a while. When we hear the guitar solos at approximately 3:30, it seems kinda belated and anticlimactic, especially since they don't go much further than that; we slip right back to the percussion. I'm only giving this a 4 because it's rather catchy.  6) Kaguya Hime - 5/5. This can be compared to "Swamp Thing", but it takes itself a lot less seriously. It's got a similar setup and form: percussion accompanied by minimal synth. About forty seconds in, we're introduced to a very playful beat that sounds like the work of hollow drums played by chopsticks. Or something like that. Midway through, the drums "mature" into a heavier-sounding variety, with some more synth playing alongside than before. It's still playful, though. In fact, this is a very fun song to listen to if you don't mind a drum being the primary instrument. Reminds me of the final segment of "Jardin". I'm only giving this a 5 because it's supremely catchy.  7) Children of the Night - 5/5. And now for something completely different. While the previous six have different styles, one can tell that they're all Juno Reactor works. With this, it might be a little more difficult. At least for me. On the platter is a tune that sounds evil yet fun. Shall we say...giddy. It's very, very giddy. You can imagine an evil force approaching to kill you, but messing with your mind first by sneaking up on you from multiple directions, or filling your mind with images from your worst nightmares. It is giddy. There's not a lot of ways to describe it. Giddiness all around. "The children of the night are call-eeng...hehehehe...hehehehe..." accompanied by the sound of puppies allegedly whimpering before their horrible, gas-filled deaths. Brrr. Did I mention it's giddy?  8) Shark - 4/5. I know, I know, it's "calm & slow". But it's also not monotonous. If you haven't figured out from the title, this conveys an underwater feeling to the listener. It's very mellow and trancy, and in some parts, definitely reminiscent of Vangelis' opening score for "Blade Runner". It's down-time for the entire song, although there is a rough patch that's supposed to resemble a tectonic plate breaking apart or something. Ruins the calmness, I think. The length is another problem; it's over nine-and-a-half minutes long. When a song doesn't have a lot of musical variety, you might wanna shorten it. On the plus side, featured here are a bunch of trippy sound effects that sound underwater-ish, but I don't really know why. Without these sounds, this song is what you'd hear at one of those big aquarium display shows. With the sounds, it's...well...Juno Reactor at its calm & slow finest.  9) High Energy Protons (Orion Mix) - 5/5. I'm fully aware it's a remix. I'm fully suspicious of the guys for being lazy. But that doesn't stop the "Bible" finale from ruling. To make it easier for you, I'll just assume that you've already listened to the original version in "Transmissions". And by "easier for you", I mean "easier for myself". Some of the techno sound is still here, but the background choir holds much more presence. Furthermore, there's the addition of a few synth riffs that add another dimension to the whole thing. However, I still like the original mix better. Don't ask why. And if you're wondering about the dialogue clips, they've dropped "You're going to have a wonderful trip." All we've got here is "You're the brain and central nervous system", "High energy protons spilling over into our atmosphere", and "Everything's going extremely well." (YES! HAL-9000!!!+music
Lotsa goodies in this stocking+P+Well, somehow I picked up the Rev's first-ever Christmas album even before the two Brians' 2005 holiday discs (the sainted Wilson and the slick Setzer, that is). As Santa said of Rudolph's first jump at the Reindeer Games in that classic Rankin-Bass "Rudolph" special, not bad! Not baaaad! There are a lot of cool and interesting goodies in this Christmas stocking, enough to please most of the Whos at your local Whoville. The disc has a chunk of Chuck Berry, and not just the album-closing "Run Rudolph Run" (with the Rev, aka guitarist Jim Heath, trading instruments with his bassist, Jimbo Wallace). It actually starts with track 1, the full-tilt boogie-woogie version of "Frosty the Snowman." The credits don't list the pianist, but "Winter Wonderland" also has a lot of that Berry/Johnnie Johnson interplay, straight out of "You Never Can Tell." There's also a bit of blazing Berry/Johnson boogie-woogie sharing space in the unlikeliest of places: alongside a mad-mod-surf "Batman" swirl on "Santa Claus Is Coming to Town." Other yummy flavors in the Rev's holiday petit fours assortment include a slap-bass rockabilly hoedown instrumental of "Jingle Bells," a Ray Charles-type gospel-meets-country-ballad version of "Silver Bells," a snarky, dirty, bottom-heavy, finger-popping rockabilly swing through "Rudolph," a hoedown of "Santa on the Roof," and an instrumental of "What Child Is This" that tosses around country, surf, spaghetti western, even a little bit of Traffic and Hendrix. That's to go along with faithful versions of Elvis' "Santa Bring My Baby Back" and Buck Owens' "Santa Looked a Lot Like Daddy." The only soft spot is Heath's voice. The Rev's rasp is well suited for his patented rockaswingapunkabilly raveups, but certainly not smooth enough for the likes of "Silver Bells" and "Pretty Paper," or even "Santa Bring My Baby Back." But hey -- you know what? This album is such a high-spirited affair, and the Rev, Jimbo and Scott Churilla, the drummer, have been such good boys this year, that Santa can overlook that shortcoming. They should find a little something extra under their trees for spreading such cheer+music
Sing your fool head off!+P+This album has become surprisingly influential.  It was the first album to feature celebrities singing badly.  I remember the first time I heard it; I laughed my head off.  It spawned three sequels and several imitations.  Hey, it even helped revive William Shatner's career!  Of course, Shatner's unforgetable renditions of &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot; and &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; are the highlights here, but there's much more.  Shatner's first mate, Leonard Nimoy, who was the most prolific actor/vocalist (five albums!), has two amazing contributions here.  Everybody's favorite butler, Sebastian Cabot, has two songs from his spoken word album where he overacts Bob Dylan lyrics.  Speaking of overacting Bob Dylan songs, you should here what Eddie &quot;Green Acres&quot; Albert does to &quot;Blowin' in the Wind&quot;.  Jack Webb recites &quot;Try a Little Tenderness&quot; in his best Joe Friday monotone.  I could go on and on, but I will get to the point and say that &quot;this album is hilarious&quot;.  I highly recommend this album to anyone who likes funny music+music
Rip Off+N+Two CDs that would fit on one and at a double price. Get another collection+music
Do Not Die Without First Hearing This Album+P+Holy Toledo!  What a mix of unbelievable sounds. From the most haunting melodies to the rockinest guitars ever heard with sounds inbetween you've never imagined.  It's unnerving and riveting and shocking and there's a crazy edge to it that kind of stuns the senses because they can't be sure they're really hearing what they've just heard.  Highly addictive.  Highly unusual but an absolute must have listening experience.  "Baby's on Fire" and "Cindy tells me" are worth the price by themselves.      I can't live without cranking this thing up two or three times a month and listening to it 2-3 times straight.      I'm going to shut up now because I have to go listen to it again.  All the cudos from other reviewers here are dead on.  This is one amazing album that I will be drawn to 30 years from now and I've had the vinyl since '74.  The CD is perfection. This is an underground classic+music
Disappointing+N+I purchashed this CD remix single thinking it was a medley of the original songs, but it turns out it is just Prince remaking his old hits and blending them together.  It's a little deceitful that it doesn't say on the CD that these are re-recorded versions.  Very disappointing+music
Just plain boring+N+I've tried to make it through the album twice and I'm bored to tears with these songs. Maybe it will sound better on a cold rainy day. I so wanted to enjoy this album, but can't seem to get into the versions of these songs. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone but a die-hard fan.+music
Don't waste your money+N+The problem with this CD is their is another CD called &quot;The Singles&quot; which contains all these songs and more. The only song left out is &quot;Wind Beneath My Wings.&quot; True Sheena's version is far  superior to Bette Midler's it is better to buy the CD &quot;Machinery&quot;  from where the song was pulled+music
AC/DC at their rawest, baddest and best+P+If you buy this CD, listen to "Riff Raff" on 10, and your not convinced of the absolute transcendent beauty of the dirty-band-of-demons that was AC/DC at this time in history, you must be dead.  Although it's quite short and doesn't have the songs you might expect to see, this is an absolutely crucial document of the quintessential bad boys in their prime+music
For completists and historians only+N+I just got this at a bargain price from Amazon.co.uk. Its great for completists and Meek collectors, and even for those who want to know about girl singers or production methods of the 1960s. But it's not very listenable. There are about four really good tracks on it, and no stars with the possible exception of Glenda Collins+music
Holy Cow!+P+I got this cd almost exactly a year after hearing &quot;Not Pretty Enough&quot; on a sampler cd I got from purchasing a present for someone. I immediatly fell in love with the song, mainly because it put my feelings into words about someone. After listening to the one song for a year, my boyfriend finally got me Barricades and Brickwalls for christmas. It's awesome, and I'm listening to it now! Her voice is amazing, with a touch of breathiness that adds to the overall effect. The lyrics are another thing, so thoughtfully written out and sung from her own heart. She actually wrote the songs herself. I've never been a country fan, but the cd is making me change my view (very slowly!). I love this girl+music
if only all albums were like this one+P+There's a difference between an o.k. album and a good one, All Mod Cons is neither, All Mods Con is a masterpeice. it has a level of quality that few albums have, great songs, great production, and great fade ins and fade outs, no this is not just a collection of songs all laced together in any random order.  A very well thought out sequence has the album's lone cover The 60's-ish psychedelic/mod/pop sound that is David Watts (a Kinks song) followed, by &quot;English Rose&quot;'s acoustic guitar and ocean waves, And when the singing kicks in, and thats when it hits you how good this album really is.  &quot;In the crowd&quot;'s bass lines, guitar riffs, and melodies, is one of the many gentle gems in the album.  And then just when you think you're listening to a 60's pop album, &quot;Billy Hunt&quot;'s Guitar intro punches in, reminding you, The Jam were many things, including a great Punk Band.  Well I guess i should end there, thats Tracks 4-7. but I should mention my favorite tracks right now are (2) &quot;To be someone (didn't we have a nice time)&quot; and (8) &quot;It's too Bad&quot; but honestly the whole album is a pleasure to hear from the &quot;1,2,3,4&quot; Whisper/intro to the haunting closer &quot;Down in the the Tube Station at Midnight.&quot; Albums just don't get better than this one, folks+music
The Phantom of the Opera (Original 1986 London Cast)+N+The music in this CD is beautiful, the lyrics are lovely as well. The fact that I don't like Michael Crawfords' voice might have something to do with this...Gerard Butler was the first Phantom I heard.... so I hold my standards to him. Michael Crawfords' voice is nice, I'll admit, but give me Gerry any day. Perhaps Michael DID have a voice suited for the role, and perhaps Gerard Butler didn't, but I'm partial to emotional songs to wooden-flat ones, and baritone voices to tenor voices. Sarah has a lovely voice, but in my opinion, it is a bit too mature for the part of a 16 year old girl.  But don't let this stop you-buy this CD...you may love it, you may hate it. Just compare Michael's voice to Gerard's voice...the difference is rather laughable+music
HOLY S*IT+P+THIS ALBUM KICKS A*S, if you can't handle Angus Young in your face with amazing guitar solos then your p*ssy a*s needs too find music like Garth Brooks S*IT!+music
Here's What You Do+P+Wow / Grape Jam is incomplete. So is Columbia Legacy's Vintage. Answer....Buy both albums (Amazon's other buying options still has some copies of Vintage for around $15/disc - which in California is a third of a fill up for a camery).Take the best cuts of both, and put them on a blank disc (the only song you wont have is the (very spacy) the Lake, and the announcement to turn your platter speed from 33 1/3 to 78 for Just Like Gene Autry, a foxtrot that was on the original WOW album.  This album reminds me a lot of Buffalo Springfield Again. Pungiant little gems from a rapidly disintegrating band.  Enjoy.  Incidentally, you can do this, add The Place And The Time (original version - from Vintage), Miller's Blues (Live - from Vintage), and still have around 7 minutes to mess around with. Great for a car backup+music
great listening+N+Nice listening and partying music from a seemingly low-brow but funny and wise movie+music
I hope the islands don't lack the soul this CD does.+N+Completely disappointed. No soul, no tradition. Save your money unless you're into UB40 and synthesized reggae...ugh. It is all to obvious why there are no samples of this CD on the web page. I took one for the team...buyer beware. SUPPORT LOCAL MUSIC+music
Yer Brain on Spin Cycle+P+This is one of my top 10 CDs of all time. Check out my other reviews and you'll probably be surprised. But this CD left a lasting impression on me when i was like 16 or so. It has some of the most well-crafted SY songs in my opinion and some of the sweetest, sublime, fuzzed out guitar sounds ever.  Track 1 is the perfect song. Track 2 (Junkie's Promise) rocks harder than anything they've ever done. They played it on Conan Obrien and tore it up!!! Track 3 is beautfully hypnotic in a tripped out sort of way. This is the track that first reeled me in as I was under the influence of Wild Irish Rose watching my friends play Tekken 2. Track 4 (washing machine) is a very episodical and visual song which morphs from dischordant punk to a chill summery breeze of a jam that slowly winds down into practically nothing. Kim Gordon's snotty tuff girl attitude shines through more than ever on songs like 'Little Trouble Girl' and 'Panty Lies'. How can any true fan of alternative music hate this CD? Good experimentation with noise and distortion, yet structured songs... better than previous "Expermmental Jet Set" album. Give it a whir+music
This Is What That "Cali Iz Active" Album Should've Sounded Like (Rating: 8 out of 10- -4 stars)+P+Snoop Dogg is one of my favorite rappers. I've grown up listening to him since I was a child while he was rhyming on Dr. Dre's "The Chronic". I've even stuck by him when he put out bad albums ("The Game Is Sold...") and when he dropped a decent album ("Paid The Cost..."). "The Blue Carpet Treatment" would probably be his best in over a decade if you ask me.  This album is full of laced beats and good rhymes. "Think About It" comes off real strong from Snoop laced with a dope beat. The radio hit "Thats That..." with R. Kelly gives listeners a nice R&B tune to listen to. As well as the other hit "I Wanna Love You" with Akon, another hit for this album.   As I said in my title, this is what "Cali Iz Active" should have sounded like. That CD was so horrible and failed to follow it's concept. This album followed what that concept should have been. Most of the guest appearances are form Cali. "Candy" would feature Goldie Loc, MC Eiht, E-40, and The Dogg Pound, and a real nice tune to ride to. "LAX" with Ice Cube is another standout tune that featured a sample from Biggie's "Going Back To Cali" in the hook. I'd say for some reason, my favorite song is toward the end with "Imagine" with Dr. Dre. and D'Angelo. Possibly because that piano laced throughout the song. Snoop would close the album with "Conversations" with Stevie Wonder, showing off that he's trying to get his mind right. Other guests include The Game, B-Real from Cypress Hill, George Clinton, and Kam (where the hell have YOU been Kam???).  Although this is a good CD I've heard from Snoop in a minute, it still has some rough parts. "10 Lil' Crips" sounded kinda weak to me. And I wasn't feeling the song "Beatin' Up On Yo Pads" although it's a positive song about him coaching and playing football, but it's a good song, so I'll make it my honorable mention track.  If you heard that this album was his most consistant since "Doggystyle", you heard correct. We're more than aware that he's not going to drop another one of those albums, but this is a real good one from Snoop. If other west coast artists drop albums like this, we might have the West Coast making a comeback. And being a fan of West Coast rap music, I am more than ready for it. If you thought Snoop fell off, well he gives doubters "Tha Blue Carpet Treatment".  Lyrics: A- Production: A- Guest Appearances: A- Musical Vibes: B Overall: A-  My Favorite Tracks From This Album: Think About It, Thats That..., Candy (Drippin' Like Water), Gangbangn 101, LAX, Which One Of You, I Wanna [Love] You, Psst!, Imagine, Converstions  Honorable Mention Track: Beatin' On Yo Pads  Peace Everyone!!+music
Purple City - The Purple City Album+N+Purple City's debut release is "The Purple Album" (2006). Having made their mark on the mixtape scene the Dipset affiliate trio of Emperor Shiest Bub, Un Kasa & Don Bishop Agallah provide this release. The Harlem trio start off the album with "Live Your Life" repping their group and thanking the Diplomats for paving the way, the best part of this track for me is the chorus. The typical "Gangsta" has Shiest Bub collaborating with Jim Jones and Max B backed by the kind of beat that will put you to sleep, the verses are equally boring. Laidback "Fly High" follows, backed by some mellow production Purple City pays tribute to smoking weed in what turns out to be a smooth cut. I don't know if Purple City is paying tribute to the South movement, or trying to capitalize on it with "Trap N****" either way it's a weak attempt to sound like Young Jeezy, its actually disturbing. "Go Head" follows Purple City proclaims being gangster again on another halfhearted cut. "Nick Nack" is a lame attempt at a club track, horrible chorus. Tec, Steele and Buckshot drop in for the grimy "Hustlers".  Agallah, Un Kasa and affiliate Ike Eyes  team up for another bland cut with "Picture Me Rollin". Shiest Bub collabs with A-Mafia on "Head Bust Open" rhyming in a braggy manner while warning not to mess with Purple City.  Purple City's decides to spell things out again on "P.A.Y.D.A.Y.".  While "Grind Slow" feat. Buddy Klein is a below average cut where the group talk to the ladies.  Shiest Bub closes the album off with "Catch Him" repping himself.  Lyrically this group is not entertaining or original - listening to them I feel like I have heard it all somewhere else before. None of them have distinct flows and production is average.  If you love Dipset and are into that whole movement you may like this. This may sound brutal but listening to the "The Purple Album" to me is like watching a bad B Movie, not worth my time. +music
Jimmy Dorsey & Orchestra - Greatest Hits+N+I was disappointed in the quality of the recording. The needle noise in the recording was more prevalent than on a c.d. that I had burned from an old vinyl record+music
BOOOOO!!!!!!!+N+This album is garbage.  I love in flames and i can't find anything nice to say about this album except that when thrown from a moving car it flies really nice and shatters into a million pieces+music
Where`s the "Live @ Carnegie Hall " album????+N+Does anybody have the Live album recorded @ Carnegie Hall??? What a great record that one was.....But I`ve seen it no where...........+music
NO WORDS !+N+ITEM NEVER RECEIVED. IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTACT BY EMAIL THE CUSTOMER SERVICE. MY LAST PURCHASE ON AMAZON +music
Smoooooooth, Cool, and Hip West Coast Sound+P+When I first heard this album it captured me.  Now that I've expanded my House collection my tastes have changed a little, but I still consider this to be a stellar Deep House album.  There are enough memorable tracks on this 2-disc set to easily justify owning it.  My favorites are "Waiting", "Next To Me", "Don't Stand There", "Don't Change", "You Can't Stop", "Petalpushing", "The Remedy", and "Lionel's Jam" (in that order).  I own just about everything Migs has put out and I consider this to be his best.  If I may drop a sales pitch for a couple of his other works it would be Jay-J & Miguel Migs - In The House and Miguel Migs - Colorful You.  This latter one has some incredible R&B tracks.  My only criticism of Miguel Migs is that some of his tracks have too much Reggae and Latin/Jazz for my tastes.  Nevertheless, he is one of the best DJ/Producers I've ever heard.   +music
May be missing a song+N+For some reason there seem to be three versions of this album listed separately for sale on Amazon.  One of them only has 13 tracks.  Be sure to get the version with 14 tracks because the 14th track is too good to miss.  "Down the Line" is one of the live songs and you absolutely want to have that cut.  This review seems to appear in several versions of the albu+music
total let down+N+uninspired and down right boring. I feel I wasted over an hour of my life listening to this disc..+music
Something Different...+P+Being a fan of mostly punk rock music... I decided to give this a try. This record is highly entertaining, very fun and very original. I didnt even know that &quot;gypsy-punk&quot; existed untill I heard this. The musicianship is quite good as well. Chanty, boot stompin' songs with accordians and fiddles. I like it. I reccomend this if you like the more folky brands of punk rock (ie Swingin' Utters, Tossers, etc.) So, if you're willing to give something different a try, go ahead and pick this up+music
Dark Trance but very calming+P+This double cd is awsome! Nick Warrens mixing ability is so awsome and it earns the Global Underground name.  The cd is pretty dark and the songs are not popular club hits, but if you buy this, you shouldnt be expecting it.  This cd really puts me into a trance and i love listening to it, expecially when im driving. I would totally buy this cd to mix up your collection+music
Deeply disappointing...+N+I ran out and bought this cd the very day it came out.  Then sat listening anxiously for something to stir inside of me.  Alas, nothing.  A few weeks later, still nothing.  A month later, I tried again.  I yawned...  Then I got up and cleaned the kitchen finding that more interesting.  When I first started listening to Zero 7, I was drawn, pulled, attached to their music.  I got it, it got me--we connected.  My friend Mel asked me the other day how this cd was and I let her listen to it; she yawned and said, "I guess they've lost it".  Should they release another cd, I'd borrow it from the library first and then buy it only if I really love it.  But this cd was deeply disappointing..+music
The Garden+P+That cd is just touching and well made by Zero 7. Zero 7 is awsome and I am your fan also. Thank you for so much.+music
Definitely Creative Ministry! +P+** This CD is really my favorite, even above the Fred and Mary Mary. Also even above the mass choirs, this CD is my favorite because of its closeness and realness to me. Not only does Canton Jones get you crunk, but you can realy feel the lyrics because of their truth and accuracy in this generation. You can't help but be lifted, be drawn, and get "bout it" for Christ!   +music
Elvin Jones Kicks Ass+P+O.K. folks here we go, from an ex- Santa Barbara disc jockey to you. The best song on this excellent CD is Las Vegas Tango. What should blow your mind about this song is the multirhythmic backing of Elvin Jones on drum. The band itself is tight and strong. The song is kinda haunting. I've hummed it to myself for the past forty years, and after losing the album a while back, I bought a new CD of it through Amazon.com from England, and I am very happy I own it. I think everyone should own at least one of this, one for themselves and one to give to a friend. This album, and particularly Las Vegas Tango, is one of the best outputs of any band during the 20th century. Buy it+music
very disappointing+N+this album is terrible.  just useless noise.  i also own electric pink and very emergency.  if you liked those albums, you will agree that this one is garbage+music
Magnificent+P+Just can't praise this CD too highly.  I usually stick with classical music (Mozart, Stamitz etc) but this CD,has opened up a whole new dimension.  I just play it over and over.  Never get tired of it.+music
These Are The JBs!+P+If you love all things James Brown, then you must buy this collection of funky hits (tinged with more than a hint of jazz) he did with his 70's band, the JBs.  Believe me, you will not be able to resist the beat! The excellent horn work of Maceo Parker and Fred Wesley are worth the price of the CD alone. The majority of the cuts are R&amp;B dancing and roller skating classics, especially, &quot;(It's Not The Express) It's The JBs Monorail&quot;, &quot;Gimme Some More&quot;, &quot;Pass The Peas&quot;, &quot;Same Beat&quot;, and &quot;Damn Right, I'm Somebody&quot;.  &quot;Think&quot;, with vocals by Lyn Collins, is just too funky for words.  Don't pass this one by+music
Working This Weekend To Buy This+P+Now I know everybody would love this CD.  It is definately for the young AND old.  The tracks sound great and the new liner notes are amazing.  A great mix of Loverboy's best hits, including Working For the Weekend!!+music
Contains malware!+N+I had to return this album to Amazon after receiving an emil from them stating that it contained Sony malware.  Poor Jane! Caught up with these creeps! +music
cd+N+When I got this cd I thought it was the music from the first version and that is the main reason I bought it. Its an ok cd just not my taste in music+music
searching for alternate version+N+michelle zacharias , i totally agree with you. I can believe the ruined such a good movie qith such a terrible ending, Im looking for the hollywood version as well, for I think that jacqes should have learnt the lesson with enzos suicide and value life, especially when he is going to have a child from the beautifull woman he loves+music
has anyone found the big blue soundtrack by BILL CONTI?+N+I have searched and searched for Bill Conti's alternate motion picture score and I have had no luck.  Does anyone know how to find Bill Conti's Soundtrack Specialist?  Eric Serra's score was good but I was disappointed when I purchased it and it was NOT what I thought I bought.  Email me at mszacharias@yahoo.com if anyone has any information on how to find it.  Thanks+music
I H8 EAZY ( dre is cooler )+N+I can't believe people like Eazy-E more than Dr.Dre. Dre is way better than sleazy-e. Stay with Dre, not sleazy-e+music
There are worse albums than this one...+N+...but I listen to them even less!  I bought this album at random a few years ago.  My first impression after I bought it was &quot;mediocre British band&quot;.  I've listened to it a couple times since then, the most recent today, and my impression hasn't changed.  If it weren't for the fact that Brian Eno contributed to this album I'd probably give it one star+music
Another light-weight single from "With Teeth"+N+Only", the second single from "With Teeth", has something in common with its predecessor-- its of limited value. I picked it up and was pretty disappointed.  The single itself, "Only", isn't one of the ones I particularly enjoy on the album-- its got a nice enough funky bass line and drum beat, but Reznor's sing-speak "Down In It" styled vocal grates and the piece doesn't particularly hold my interest. Certainly it lacks the immediacy of "Down In It", and I'm generally inclined to want Reznor to look forward, not backward.  The b-sides aren't much better-- the DFA mix of "The Hand That Feeds" is yet another remix, this one pretty much a full techno mix. It's quite different, replete with an odd panting sample that gets somewhat irritating as the piece never ends (it rambles on for well over seven minutes). The live version of "Love is Not Enough" is the only saving grace on the single-- while its not one of the better songs on the record, its decent enough, and live it got bigger. The arrangement is the same, but its more direct and in your face.  For the casual listener, skip this one. The fan will be buying it regardless of what I say, but it's in line with the recent singles, not the older (and superior) ones+music
Poor mixes, poor sound+N+Someone pointed out in another review that the songs are presented in the original mono versions.  More than that, I also have the Chartbusters (12 cds) Mowtown compilation and in addition some old vinyl recordings, and I have noticed that the actual _mixes_ are not even the same as the original recordings.  For instance, on Stevie Wonder's "For Once In My Life" and Glady Knight and the Pips' "I Heard It Through The Grapevine" there are parts that are just plain missing.  I'm very disappointed, as my favorite songs do not sound at all as I remember them. Update:  I listened again.  I think I might have been mistaken when I said that parts were just plain missing.  I think it's just that the mono versions actually bury things that come across more clearly in the stereo versions.  It just a shame that the original record company couldn't have done a better job in light of the advent of the CD+music
THE best Jazz Album +P+I have been listening to Jazz for 31 years now, and have not discovered a better album than this.  You get Miles in his prime, Trane AND Cannonball,  and a rhythm section that was just SICK.  Every track swings.  Every note is ON.  Do yourself a favor: GET THIS CD RIGHT NOW!!+music
Very disappointed.+N+I grew up listening to her "In Concert" album, and bought the Pearl album based on reviews saying this was a more mature style for her music.  I like her old style better, this sounds like she was trying to make a more pop sound for her music (although the singing wasn't much different).  It not only didn't sound like what you expect from Janice Joplin, it sounded like a muzak imitation of her+music
Just get this CD and you will be happy+P+Ralph Stanley is a God of bluegrass and this CD shows us why. The man's voice has such character and presence and power. The music is as good as bluegrass gets and the harmonies are great.  There is a good variety of music on this CD. From barn burners to slow mournful dirges, its all here. You wouldnt think that an album full of songs about death would be uplifting, but it is.  Highly Recommended+music
Shouldn't Have Been Me+N+My mistake. I had only heard "Should've Been The One" which I thought sounded very good. That, however, was the only song produced in the studio and unfortunately the only song I liked enough to justify the purchase. The rest of the songs are live, apparently recorded at a small venue, if you can judge by the applause. Like I said...my fault. Not saying any of the songs are bad. Maybe more of them will grow on me. Just not what I expected. Moral: it pays to listen to most of a CD before you buy it.(duh) You never know what you're gonna get+music
Macerating metal noise fired by sheer punk genius+P+I bought this album when I was 17. I'm now 31 and I still haven't recovered! This album, as said before, represents the indie punk ideal only feinted at by Nirvana, Sonic Youth etc. Steve Albini and co assault you here with a white-hot mind-melting onslaught  of musical savagery, from the beserk guitar-driven Colombian Necktie through the nosebleed-inducing Pavement Saw to the juddering, sinister colossus of Tiny, King of the Jews. Sheer uncompromising overbuilt punk, this represents Big Black at their zenith. With bands like this in the world there's no excuse for mediocrity+music
You must own.  NOW.+P+If forced to pick one band that best exemplified the indie-rock aesthetic, one would be hard-pressed to find a better choice than Big Black.  Many of the acts typically credited with bringing alternative music to the mainstream have, for better or worse, been little more than angry pop acts (Nirvana and Nine Inch Nails being prominent examples), and even many more underground acts such as Pixies, Sonic Youth, and the Jesus Lizard released some material that was palatable to the mainstream, as their major-label runs attest.  Big Black, on the other hand, was the real deal, a band that lived out the indie philosophy in both their music and in their resolutely do-it-yourself business practices, and paid the commercial price for it.  Songs About F***ing was the perfect distillation of leader Steve Albini's philosophy: an abrasive, confrontational album that contained no concessions to the mainstream and no pretensions to socially redeeming value.  This is music at its most twisted and evil, acknowledging no taboos as it challenged listeners to take or leave its assaultive sound and unpleasant lyrical content.    The key to the lasting appeal of this release lies largely in its simplicity.  Like fellow pioneering noise-merchants Godflesh, Big Black distilled rock music to its most basic elements: guitar, bass, and drum machine.  In spite of this minimal approach, however, Songs About F***ing is hardly palatable or unchallenging.  What emerges from this combination of rock's traditional elements is a barrage of scathing, disembowling noise that pummels eardrums with a mix of astringent guitar squalls and pulsating industrial beasts.  And of course, it's all topped off with the demented vocal stylings of Albini himself, making Kurt Cobain sound like Mel Torme as he howled and screamed his tales of depravity.    Mixing metal, punk, and the then-burgeoning genre of industrial with reckless abandon, Songs About F***ing constitutes a musical roller coaster of frightening proportions, and wraps things up in barely half an hour.  The basslines and drum programming of Bad Penny and Colombian Necktie are enough to crack skulls, while Albini's vocals legitimately bring to mind a man in the midst of a nervous breakdown.  L-Dopa is all punkish speed and aggression but infinitely more frightening, and the proto-industrial rage of Precious Thing and Kasimir N. Pulaski Day would send Trent Reznor up a tree.  Even when the band slows down, as on Kitty Empire, the results are clenched, sinister, and intense.  Tiny, King of the Jews (love that title) actually manages to be somewhat atmospheric, but it still relies heavily on that mix of disconcerting guitar noise and pulsating beats.  I've listened to pretty much every noted act in the extreme-music world, from Slayer to Godflesh to Meshuggah, and Big Black may have been the scariest of all.  And Songs about F***ing in an unqualified triumph, one that oozes menace and integrity at the same time.  Own it, or pose+music
The primal scream, courtesy of Steve Albini. +P+First off, consider the packaging. The title SONGS ABOUT F--KING rendered in loving bold, and cover art that puts all "shock rockers" (that means you, Marilyn Manson) in their place. That alone makes it worth adding to your collection. Too bad this was the band's last release. Leave it to Steve to break a band up just as they were attracting an audience.    Big Black is pure nihilism in audio form. A young Steve Albini (pre-Shellac and before he was reduced to producing Bush albums) backed by a constantly pulsing drum machine named Roland and furiously feedback-driven guitar noise while ranting his stories of Midwest depravity and illness with an almost infectious glee. This is what happens when Kraftwerk goes to hell (they even cover that German duo's The Model here), or when a bunch of angry, drunk, baseball bat-wielding nerds start playing New Wave while setting a trailer park on fire. Though there have been faster bands, heavier bands, nobody has ever sounded so gritty and hateful as these guys do.    Ah.. enough hyperbole. So, why only four stars (actually 4.5)? Well, there's nothing as great as previous albums' Steelworker, Bad Houses, Kerosene, or Jordan, Minnesota--songs that are so definitive of Big Black's style. However, there are plenty of songs that come awful close: The poppy yet deliciously evil Bad Penny ("I think I f--ked your girlfriend once, maybe twice, I don't remember"), the demented almost-surf rock of Columbian Necktie, the eerie proto-industrial grind of Kitty Empire, the vicious Fish Fry, and the lovely free-floating hostility of Tiny, King Of The Jews. Also notable is a cover of Cheap Trick's He's A Whore that strips away the innuendo and leaves just the grimy sleaze.   Essential music for the misanthrope in all of us. Also recommended highly are fellow Touch & Go outfits The Jesus Lizard and Albini's later "supergroup" Rapeman.+music
Finally available!+P+I'm so thrilled to discover this recording is out on CD as I've worn out my cassette. Brilliant playing, group interaction...the sense of urgency in this performance as Bill neared the end of his life his heart-rending.  I never write reviews but this is one of my favorite albums of all time+music
Disappointing+N+I'd like to start by saying how amazing New American Gospel is.  Then by saying what a solid follow-up As The Palaces Burn is.  Lamb of God is truly one of the best American thrash/metalcore acts.  However, If you enjoy either of their first releases, I would recommend skipping this one.  It's disappointing and generic.  If you're considering buying this and don't own the previous albums, buy them first.  Lamb of God is an aggressive, technically skilled band, and I really expect their next release to be a comeback after this one+music
Po' Ruben!+N+I loved the big guy on American Idol, hell I even voted for him, but this CD is so blah! Everything sounds the same. I can tell the CD was rushed of course, and they thought the tracks would be good just b/c he has a great voice. Ever since he won he's just been goin downhill. And i'm not one for playing the race-card here, but in this case, COME ON! Mr. Girly Man Aiken gets the cover of Rolling Stone and all Ruben gets is the cover of JET?! He was the winner for goodness sake! I guess it all can't be fair. And Hello! has anyone seen the video for Sorry 2004? If a stalker ever had a theme song that one's it. Followin the poor girl,peakin around corners, puh-lease! I couldn't give the CD less than one star, otherwise, baby boy, u woulda got negative NONE! Zip zero, no dinero+music
One  of  Alan's Best+P+Alan Jackson is truly one of the best new country singers around. I enjoyed his version of all of these songs. He actually sings them better than the original singers, Farewell Party and Kiss An Angel Good Morning are so  well done. I hope  he comes out with another CD of this kind+music
Scrap it+N+Don't buy this album.  You would have to have pretty drab music taste to like this generic, emotionless, tired, garbage.  Merkin Dream is clearly ripping off any worthwhile downtempo group that they find fitting (ie. Massive Attack, Air, Everything But the Girl), plus there is no vocal talent in the 3 songs they actually sing in.  Someone thought Track 7 was funny or cute because a robotic voice says, "Does my hard drive turn you on?"  What is wrong with you people?  If you want decent robo-pop music, try Kraftwerk, Figurine, or even Ladytron.  My advice to Merkin Dream is to stop making music because you're brainwashing poor children out there into thinking you're something good+music
Not the best+N+I love George Strait's music.If you look at my profile you will see that I have rated numerouse other cd's of his and gave them all 5 star. He is my favorite artist, but this cd is just plain bad.+music
Glider+P+Some of this is quite pretty - - "Kometenmelodie 2", in fact, waxes practically majestic.  And it's true:  the title track glides along with four wheels off the ground for 22 minutes or so.  And the recorder piece that closes the album (replete with little birdies twittering all over the place) is a bit of a pleasant and unexpected surprise; "Morgenspaziergang", after all, translates as "A Morning Walk".  Not quite of its time, and slightly before it, you have a bona fide classic here.  Fah'n on.+music
OOOOOOOOOOOOH PLEASE MAN GET REAL PEOPLE A NO BUY !+N+MAN YOU CANT EVEN MAKE OUT MOST OF THE SONG MAKE'S YOU THINK YOUR CD PLAYER IS BUGGING AND NEEDS TO BE CLEANED OR 86/JUNKED MAN TV-GUIDE NEED TO WATCH WERE THEY PUT THERE LOGO OVER THEY MIGHT HAVE SOMEONE IN THE PARKING LOT LOOKING FOR THERE MONEY BACK WITH SMILE ON THERE FACE BUT NOT THE KIND YOU WANT TO SEE ON SOMEONE UNLESS YOUR CRAZY ALSO AND WANT TO HANG OUT AND HIT THE PIPE WITH THEM AND BUG OUT TOGETHER !!!!!!+music
Bobby Darin: Live in Las Vegas+P+As a fan of Bobby Darin, it was a treat to hear him perform in the old Las Vegas.  The way entertainment should be in any venue.  Because of the 100th Anniversary of Las Vegas, the album will become part of my collection celebrating this momentous event.  Don't miss this one of a kind CD+music
uneven effort+N+While it seems to be the tendency of many Cave fans to drool over anything the man records, this is not an album that is up to par with many of his other efforts.  There are some stand out tracks such as "Deanna" and "Mercy", but many of the rest come off as either overwrought or overly bombastic.  Obviously, if you're already a fan, you'll want this disc regardless, but to anyone new to Nick Cave's work I recommend his "Best of" collection or "The Boatman's Call"+music
Great, but not the best of+P+I've been listening to Soul Coughing religiously for years now and was thrilled when this disc was released (even though I knew I'd have almost all the material on it). Although all the songs here are well worthy of being here, I feel there are some songs missing that need to be here. Where are "Fully Retractable" and "I Miss the Girl", two of the funkiest Soul Coughing tracks? I am very pleased, however, that "Unmarked Hellicopters" was put on here despite not being on a precious Soul Coughing release. All in all this is a great disc, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good overwiew of soul coughing's music. However, I'm sure other die hard soul coughing fans will agree that there are some great tunes missing from this disc+music
GREAT RELEASE!!+P+Despite the very obvious issues with overdubbing, this is a GREAT release form the sisters. An album after being absent for 14 years?! What more can any Clark fan expect. I'm surprised to see contributions from Karen and Dorinda in terms of writing. Since Twinkie has been writing the music for 30 years, I figured that the case would be the same. What a nice surprise. Karen and Dorinda are both great song writers.+music
Great but where`s the rest of the best+P+OK so everyone has different tastes but to my mind some of Glenn`s best work did not make the cut on this album.  Instead we`ve been given work which has`nt appeared in any of Glenn`s previous releases, Common Ground, Who`s been sleepin in my bed etc, which while good pale beside I Volunteer, That Girl, Some Kind of Blue which all sound like they could have been Eagles tunes.  Having said that it is a good album although I would recommend Soul Searchin, Strange Weather ahead of this one.  Further proof that the Eagles whole is better than its part+music
Sorry...I don't like it...+N+Personally, I like the other albums from Staind. I love "Dysfunction", I like "Break the Cycle", "14 Shades..." was tolerable, and I really enjoyed "Chapter V". However, even for a debut, "Tormented" just sounds inmmature. There's emotion, but I lost count on the how many times the "f-word" is not only mentioned on the album, but on each song alone. Then again, Fred Durst produced this band in the first place, so that probably had a lot to do with it. All in all, the album itself just flat out sucks+music
ouch, not good, buy Bo instead+N+George picked the worst way to show his voice.Songs are so boring and he doesn't stay in the right key! Save your money and buy Bo Bice's new AWESOME, AMAZING, album called The Real Thing! Bo will show you how it's done! Bo's the REAL DEAL folks! Bo blows all the other Idols who ever went on the show out of the water, makes them look real bad, yuck for Georgie!+music
Enjoyed the variety of artists+P+Great music... I have listened to a vast amount of  New Orlean's numbers and find this music very entertaining+music
Supreme Gothenberg Thrash!+P+Finally some good old fashion HEAVY thrash metal from thrash giants The Haunted. I will say that every track is amazing, it's a non stop pulsating blast of thrash shoved down your thropat and bursting your ear drums. Yes it is that good. Now maybe I've over hyped it,  but I loved it that much. I haven't heard something this good since Carnal Forge! For fan of Carnal Forge, Slayer, and Lamb of God, you definately must check this band out! Good musicianship, fast paced, brutal, and heavy thrash is what can be found here. A must buy+music
Soundrack itunes - not the movie - movie get's 5 stars+N+Oh, stop whining ... they're pretty smart in one sense.  They knew they had a good thing with "I Like to Move It."  Do I like it?  No.  Do I understand it?  Sure.  There are plenty of schmoes who will impulse buy and pay the whole thing.   Me?  I plan on buying it later when the price goes down.  To e-bay we go! +music
This IS Pop,I Think!+P+XTC didn't start out with any remote idea of aspiring to the very stifling punk classicism of the day.The only relation  'White Music' has to punk is the simple three chord structures.  Otherwise tunes like the catchy &quot;This Is Pop&quot; and the offbeat,  quircky reggae of &quot;All Along The Watchtower&quot; have more relation to not only early British invasion music but to the more abstract musical experiments of American avante rockers.Neither is this in any way typical XTC-in years to come the band would  develope a sound much more melodic and sweet (neither of those  terms ever apply to this music) but the stuttering vocals and  Andy Partirdge's clever humor are more then enough to carry this album.From a guy whose more interested in funk and fusion normally I find this album worth a listen-'White Music' will  definately command your attention.And it's not too loud either+music
This Is A Great CD.+P+Alan Is One The Best Country Singers Today. When I First Heard &quot;She's Got The Rhythm (And I Got The Blues)&quot; I Began To Like It. He Can Sang Romantic Ballads Like: &quot;(Who Says) You Can't Have It All&quot; A Top  Ten Hit In Early 1994. The Songs I Like On This Album Are: &quot;Tonight I  Climbed The Wall&quot;, &quot;Mercury Blues&quot;, 1993's Big Number 1 Hit  &quot;Chattahoochee&quot;. You've Got To Buy This Album+music
Sure these guys can shred and play fast...............but what else can they do ?+N+NOT A LOT ELSE TO BE HONEST.  So many people have been fooled in to believing this band is amazing simply because of the speed that they play at, but to be honest is speed really everything?  All the songs on the CD lack creativity and sounds pretty much the same as the last song .  Every fu**ing track on this album is plagued with fast drum beats, some crappy power metal riff that remains throughout the song and lightning fast guitar solos which is impressive when you've heard one but by the end of the CD its a drag.  Don't get me wrong, to be able to play this takes a hell of a lot of skill and ability, but they need to use that skill and ability to come up with something a lot more creative and inventive+music
zero stars+N+One WEAK night!...zero stars if that was available. I never realized Bon Jovi was this bad a live band. They obviously get a LOT of production help in the studio because this album (several different concerts in several different venues) is ALL bad.  Sorry for them and sorry for me for buying it+music
Smart sounds for the new millenium+P+There seems little point to classifying this music. When standard tunes from the American Songbook and jazz idioms such as swing and bebop spark little to no recognition among the general public, music that could once be called "experimental" or "avant garde" necessarily defines the modern mainstream. If there are similarities with early landmark recordings (e.g. Miles Davis' 70s fusion groups),  "Lawn Chair Society" would definitely qualify as the less raw and extemporaneous, more polished and civil descendant of its once-controversial forebears.  Aside from electronics and musical synthesis, three qualities in particular stand out about this music: composition is emphasized above improvisation; creativity and craftsmanship count for more than interpretation and invention (both of which require a standard repertoire); tonal colors, dynamics and humor receive the kind of attention they enjoyed with Duke Ellington, before the "bebop revolution."  Lest any listeners require the "jazz" label to enjoy this music, Kenny Werner has called on the A Team for this multifarious collection of tone poems and programmatic pieces. The trumpet of Dave Douglas and bass clarinet of Chris Potter descend on "Lo's Garden" like a busy, darting pair of humming birds (joined at the hip, naturally). Soon a more vegetative pace is established by Scott Colley's firmly grounded bass while Brian Blade's percussion alternates between following movement at the sub-particle and quantum-field levels. Meanwhile, Werner's keyboards paint patterns in waves of sound, moving from prepared piano to phased Fender wahs, with a dab of string synth for highlighting.  "Burble_burble_spleek" is as onomatopoeic as the title--wind chimes, telephone rings and Douglas playing some of the most vocalized (and intestinal) trumpet sounds this side of Clark Terry and Rex Stewart. "Uncovered Heart," a calming guitar-like ballad in E Major, is soon followed by the ambitious title number-- a collage of funked-up chatter, vocalized demagoguery by each horn player, some thoughtful discourse by Werner on piano, a ghostly dirge-like refrain intoned by unison horns, and finally the faint sounds of birds and hunters (certainly not a reference to a familiar White House-Halliburton figure?).  Closure comes not with a bang but with "Loss," essentially a richly-textured chorale by synthesized strings, followed by "Kothbiro," an extended peaceful incantation based on a simple African melody.  In conclusion, if "Kind of Blue" and Bill Evans' Vanguard Sessions are in your blood, this one is unlikely to replace either one.  All the same, it's well-conceived, smartly-executed, cutting-edge mixed-genre jazz+music
Noise, yes. Ambient or art, no.+N+Eeyucch. Sounds like being stuck waiting for someone in the lobby of a Vegas hotel while the housekeeping staff is cleaning up in the background. Oh look, isn't that Wayne Newton over there+music
More reverb than a Def Leppard album!+N+I like Slayer.  I really do.  This is one of the fastest, heaviest metal bands in existance, but I could never get in to their early albums, especially Hell Awaits.  I tend to prefer their later albums like Reign in Blood, because they were much better produced.  Rick Rubin made those records sound the way a speed metal record should, with everything up front in your face.  Reign in Blood had the most "in your face" sound of any record I've ever heard.  Hell Awaits on the other hand is just soaked in so much reverb that it sometimes reminds me of "Pyromania" by Def Leppard!  This is one of the heaviest bands in existance.  How is a speed metal band supposed to sound heavy when their producer insists on making them in to the speed metal version of Def Leppard?  Thrash is supposed to be "in your face".  There's no place for reverb on a speed metal record.  You want to hear heavilly reverbed production, than go buy a Def Leppard CD!  I myself prefer a more aggressive style that fits this kind of music.  Down with reverb!  I HATE reverb!  Layers of reverb have no place in speed metal+music
Gilding the Lilly+N+The selection of songs for this cd is excellent, however unable to leave well enough along they include overblown intros, restarts, embellishments etc making the original tune almost unrecognizable.  The arranger should be shot+music
Stolen Music+N+Several songs on this album are note for note copied from Titus.  Has Tyler Bates no shame?  The original composer (Titus' Elliot Goldenthal) created an awesome score, buy it instead+music
Another Excellent Frank Black Album+P+Part of me wishes that Frank Black had condensed this 2 disc album into 1 really great album, but it's still, on the whole, a really great CD.  You'll fall in love with these songs+music
Awful :(+N+I love Balkan Beatbox and Matisyahu.. but "so called seder" was a so called... nightmare!  I was actually appalled I had purchased it without hearing many of the songs. I know it's acceptable to say certain things in rap/hip-hop.. but when it comes to our music.. please don't even go there!!  I was hoping for something more along the lines of Balkan Beatbox or Matisyahu, but sadly suprised at the lyrics I was hearing and sent it back to J-Dub with a letter why.. *sigh+music
VERY DISAPPOINTED+N+I BOUGHT THIS CD FOR MY SON - WE ARE SEARCHING FOR GOOD R&amp;B / RAP WITH A POSITIVE MESSAGE - WE WERE VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS CD - THE RECORDING QUALITY WAS LACKING, THE BEATS VERY REPETITIVE AND UNINSPIRING, YOU COULD HARDLY HEAR THE WORDS - OVERALL - WE ARE LISTING THIS CD FOR SALE AND WE JUST BOUGHT IT YESTERDAY! MY HUSBAND, SON AND I ALL AGREED WITHIN TEN MINUTES THAT THIS CD WAS NOT A WINNER+music
Wonderful+P+Our family has enjoyed listening to this very much, we received it just in time for St. Patrick's Day+music
O-Town's Finest!+P+Spice delivers another classic for his fourth effort (and it's one of his top 3 albums). It has 15 songs, of which 4 are classics, 2 are near classics, 6 are good, 2 are ok, and 1 I skip. Guests are few and production is great. Produced by Blackjack (4 songs), Chase & Bosko (3 songs each), Ant Banks and Payback (2 songs each). It's a shame he didn't get no airplay over here on the east coast cause he'd have definitely gone multi-platinum as he deserves to do. Even though I'm used to Southern Cali rappers from MC Eiht to Ice Cube to CJ Mac, Spice did it with 1990-Sick to put the Bay on the map of gangsta rap.  The song 1990-Sick(Kill' Em All) featuring MC Eiht is a strong & heavy  Thug'sta song about haulicinations, Dirty Bay is a hard classic delivered by Dr.Bomb from da Bay, Sucka Ass Nigga featuring G-Nut is a hard Ice-T like hard hitter, and of course Spice has a horrorcore song called Snitch Killas that sounds like something of the Geto Boys or Ice Cube, this is Spice's #1 Album!  Freddy Chico's best are *1(featuring MC Eiht), *2, 3, 4(featuring Kokane), 5, 6, 7, *8(featuring G-Nut), 9, 10, 11, 12, *13, 14(featuring E-40) & 15.+music
Great music but poor quality disc+P+I bought this several years ago (before Amazon was around), and I love it. I loved the song "Bangkok" back when it got so much airplay in the 80's, and it was a pleasure to hear the rest of the musical. However, after spending $35 on the 2 disc set, one of the cd's cracked after a few plays. It wasn't my player, or anything like that - it just simply cracked. So one of these days I will replace it, and then I will be SURE to make a backup straight off just in case.   Also, I've never heard the Broadway version, but my husband has listened to both and says the original London cast version is far superior+music
Fat Joe - Me, Myself and I +N+Fat Joe's (A.K.A. Jose Antonio Cartagena) seventh solo album is "Me, Myself and I". Those familiar with his work may have noticed the album cover is similar to one of better releases his third album "Don Cartagena". The Bronx MC keep's this release short at twelve track's, and this album has three guest appearances which come from The Game, Lil Wayne and H-Mob. Production comes from Street Runner, LV, The Runner's DJ Khaled, Nu Jerzey Devil & Scott Scorch. The Runner's provide some of the best production on "No Drama" (Clap And Revolve) a grimy sounding cut. Lyrically Fat Joe is his usual braggy less then entertaining self for most of this album. His lyrics are as egotistical as his album titles. My problem with Fat Joe resides in the fact that he never puts any of his people on, instead following the same formula time after time. The Terror Squad is a crew full of talented MC's (even with the loss of Cuban Link and Triple Seis) and singer Tony Sunshine has a lot of potential - all of them get put on the back burner each year for a less then impressive Fat Joe album. Two of this album's closing track deserve some praise - Fat Joe's dedication to his Mom on "Bendicion Mama" and the follow up cut "Story To Tell" are decent. Buyer Beware, satisfaction not guaranteed+music
King of the blues!+P+Excellent transaction, this CD was in perfect condition. I've spent hours of amazing fun listening to this amazing artist. thanks so much for such a great transaction+music
Brain Massage+P+I have purchased both Awakened Mind System discs (original and 2.0) and both are amazing.  They have taken my meditations to a whole new level.  They are also great for power napping or doing creative work.  I feel that the Awakened Mind System discs are better than many of Thompson's other discs for two reasons.  First, AMS uses combinations of all brainwave frequencies (beta, alpha, theta, delta) which makes you feel both relaxed and energized, peaceful and creative, dreamy and focused, all at once.  This makes AMS useful for many different activities.  Second, they are outstanding for meditation because the music is purely ambient and abstract.  Many of Thompson's other discs, including the Theta Meditation System, use some ambience interspersed with repetitive melodies which can be quite distracting while meditating.  If you're looking for music to deepen your meditation, enhance your mental functioning, or even help you sleep, try the Awakened Mind System+music
Everyone whos ever reveiwed this is a idiot+N+Ok so i was reading the reveiw for this album and i heard a lot of people talkin trash, and a lot of people talkin candy canes and butterflys. So im here to set the record straight.   First of all, to all the folks who think this band is so great... Yes in the early years they had a good sound, and their songs ant bad, but they really sold out. You can walk into any mall right now and find sum 12 year old wearing a casualties shirt, or hat, or wallet, or patch, or toilet seat. They did the warped tour for gods sack. They obviously are worried more about money and fame then music. This has turned into teenybopper music, the same little @#!^'s that listen to blink 182 and sum 41 have this album. They go into a hot topic and buy it on cd with their mommys credit card, along with a 50 dollar pair of pants that look like sumone made in a clown college. This is not a great punk band, its punk for yuppies.  And to all the people that think its the worst band ever... I am so sick of hearing idiots that think they know everything about punk trashing the casualties saying they are fashion punks... Wether you wunna believe it or not punk has always had to do with clothes... Look at the new york dolls, alice cooper, richard hell, or the sex pistols. They all had a look, a image, and they started this whole thing. "they said hey richard are you going to go out tonight, i said i am unsertent, I ant feeling to right. But i WRIPED UP MY SHIRT, watched the mirror and flirt, yeah im going to go out, out into sight.". And im sick of hearing about how they dont know how to play... NO punk bands know how to play, one of the reasons that punk is so great is that anyone can pick up a guitar or a drum set and start a group.   So in closing, your all idiots that know nothing about punk music, old or new. your opinions reflect your ignorance about the punk scene and non of you should ever call your selves punks.+music
More classic  Pac+P+Of all of Tupac's post death material, this is probably my favourite album.  Though some may complain that the songs were not as Pac intended, I think they are a fitting tribute to him and for the most part, the updated production is great.  Most will already have heard the singles "letter 2 My Unborn" and "Until The End Of Time", both are great, and it is easy to see why they were chosen as singles.  Other notable tracks are "This Aint Livin" which is probably the best track on here, "Breathin", "Everything They Owe", "Lastonesleft", "M.O.B" and "World Wide Mob Figgaz".  In fact most of the tracks on here are at least good.  It goes without saying that this album is not as good as the material Pac produced while alive, after all these are his throw away songs.  Just goes to show what a genius Pac was, that these are songs he didn't consider good enough for his albums, they put most other rappers A tracks to shame.  I give it 4 stars because there are a few filler tracks and The Outlawz are just on here too much.  While I have a load of respect for The Outlawz for staying true to Pac, I just don't rate their rapping skills too highly.  Anyway an amazing album, especially considering Pac had been dead for 5 years when this was released.  R.I.P Tupac +music
A treasure trove of memorable late '70's hits+P+&quot;Super Hits of the '70's - Have A Nice Day Vol. 21&quot; contains yet more of those '70's power-pop Top 40 tunes you've come to know and love. This collection focuses on the late '70's - specifically late 1977/early 1978. Ram Jam's &quot;Black Betty&quot; kicks things off into high gear, with an unmistakable Southern-rock, hard-edged flair. As the Autumn months of '77 rolled around, moviegoers hadn't quite gotten their fill of the box-office mega-flick &quot;Star Wars&quot;, which was released in theaters earlier that summer, so a discofied rendition of John Williams' original score was released - this version by Meco titled &quot;Star Wars Theme/Cantina Band&quot;, which hit the Billboard charts big-time and made it to number one, as well. The Los Angeles-based group Player reaped adequate rewards from their first single titled &quot;Baby Come Back&quot;, released during early '78. Player's success was short-lived however, and saw just two more singles enter the charts during the course of the year, and disbanded soon afterward. The absolute worst song of all time appears on this collection - Meri Wilson's &quot;Telephone Man&quot;. Whoever had the foresight to include this clutter here had to have been on battery acid, as it is just plain horrible and incredibly insipid - which is why &quot;Have A Nice Day Vol. 21 gets four stars instead of five. Now that we've gotten that senseless, moronic &quot;tune&quot; out of the way, let us continue onward. Ex-Spirit and Jo Jo Gunne member Jay Ferguson, who had a hit with the former group and sang lead on the single &quot;I've Got A Line On You&quot; in the late '60's, contributes here with his only solo chart effort &quot;Thunder Island&quot;, released in the Spring of '78. If it's wispy, sentimental ballads that you crave, there's Dan Hill's &quot;Sometimes When We Touch&quot;, a major hit in both the U.S. and Canada also during the Spring of '78. For a howlingly good time, ghouls, ghosts and goblins will have a frightfully good time with Warren Zevon's &quot;Werewolves Of London&quot;. Moviegoers in the Winter of '77/'78 will recognize ex-Bread frontman David Gates' &quot;Goodbye Girl&quot; from the movie of the same name, which was released in April of '78 after the motion picture's release. Wales's Bonnie Tyler had her first big hit with &quot;It's A Heartache&quot; during the Summer of '78, as well as did Michael Johnson with his hit - the melancholic tear jerker &quot;Bluer Than Blue&quot;. Before Exile jumped the pop ship into country music waters, they hit it big with &quot;Kiss You All Over&quot;, written by two of the group's members - Mike Chapman and Nicky Chinn, who became songwriters and mega-producers for other artists during the late '70's and early '80's. Finally, to round out this collection of chartbusters, there's Walter Egan's top twenty smash &quot;Magnet And Steel&quot;, which also features backing vocals courtesy of Fleetwood Mac's Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks. As far as &quot;Telephone Man&quot; is concerned, I felt Rhino could have utilized better singles for this collection from that era in its place, such as Dolly Parton's &quot;Here You Come Again&quot;, or Firefall's &quot;Just Remember I Love You&quot; (both released in Autumn of '77), to name a few, although there are several other singles from this time period that could have definitely gotten the nod over &quot;Telephone Man&quot;. Even though we're stuck with TM, &quot;Have A Nice Day Vol. 21&quot; is still a good arrangement of superbly crafted pop tunes to have in your CD collection at any rate. A must have for completeists of this 25 volume series+music
Fuzzy SpectorSwede Power Pop+P+If you mix up the awesome Primitives from the 80s, with the Spector wall of sound , in a Swedish garage with some power pop licks you might get something like The Legends. That being said they are not rigidly classifiable. Just great music.  This was one CD I was glad I got and have played it the most in the last couple of months.+music
Sorry To Disagree!+N+I can't believe how watered down and lifeless this album sounds! SOUL ASYLUM released an absolute winner with "Hang Time", a perfect blend of pop, punk and metal. With "And the Horse They Rode in On", I am truly baffled as to what happened. First off, even if you actually like the music here in, the cover is GOD AWFUL!!! And that title! What was going on Dave Pirner's mind?!?! Now, before you lovers of this album hang me, this release has its moments. "Spinning" starts off great and it's a great follow up song to the "Hang Time" album. But from there, the songs are a mixture of hit and miss with no real stand out tracks. And the production makes SOUL ASYLUM sound as bland as your favorite JELL-O flavor. For an ex-hardcore band this is really a low point. The songs sound as if something's about to happen, but in the end we are left wondering what happened. The irony of it all is that SOUL ASYLUM's so called "sell out" album (you know what album!)has more balls than this release!!! Sad but true, but what's even sadder is that Dave Pirner is actually a good songwriter and I'll have to wonder what made his mind so dry as to put this mediocre album out+music
the best means the best+P+this album covers all of maries long career and every track down memory lane is a gem a must for osmond fans.if you are not a fan you will be after listening to the best of marie osmond+music
This CD could have been way better!+N+This CD Sucks. I mean Bruce Springstein is such a has been. Dude retire please!  U2 also another has been group. I think someone needs to revamp the Grammy nominations and choose some really great music. Ya know songs that will last forever and never grow old!!+music
Iron Maiden's last great album for twelve years+P+Iron Maiden's seventh studio album fittingly called Seventh Son of a Seventh Son was released in April of 1988. The album was the band;s first new studio album in nearly two years and would be their last with guitarist Adrian Smith until his return on 2000's Brave New World(not coincidentally it was also their last masterpiece for twelve years as well). Smith plus lead singer Bruce Dickinson, bass player Steve Harris, guitarist Dave Murray and drummer Nicko McBrain made certain that Adrian's last album with Maiden for over a decade was also arguably the band's best album as I found out when I got the Capitol Record cassette version in May of 1988 and later the remastered CD. Seventh Son of a Seventh Son was Maiden's first concept album about a cursed child who is born with special powers and it tempted by the side of both good and evil. Also, the band was starting to become more progressive sounding as their music was reminiscent to that of ELP, Genesis, Pink Floyd and so forth with the tempo changes and lyric-wise. We begin the album with Moonchild which begins as an acoustic passage giving this album's theme and then it builds into a superb rocker penned by Smith and Dickinson. Next is the superb Infinite Dreams penned by Harris and was a great progressive rocker alternating between quiet and heavy and light and dark sections. Next was the album's biggest hit Can I Play With Madness penned by Smith/Harris/Dickinson which sounded reminiscent to the previous album, 1986's Somewhere in Time's biggest hit, Wasted Years. Next is The Evil That Men Do also penned by Harris/Smith/Dickinson and is another stellar rocker. This song was always one of my favorites. The album's second half begins with the epic length title cut! Like the 13 plus minute Rime Of The Ancient Mariner and 9 minute Alexander The Great before it, it is the longest and best track on the album. Unlike those two aforementioned epics, the Harris penned title cut was the band's first 10 minute track which they created the story themselves. Wonderful musicianship throughout, especially Murray and Smith's guitar duels at the end which is an awesome piece of music. The Prophecy is next and is a great track penned by Murray/Harris and ends with a superb acoustic guitar section. next is the album's third single The Clairvoyant which is another great rocker. We end the album with arguably one of Maiden's best album closers Only The Good Die Young. This Harris/Dickinson penned piece is a killer rocker. Then when you think the album ended after the big finish, the album ends with a reprise of the acoustic passage that started Moonchild.  Seventh Son of a Seventh Son was another Top 20 charting US million seller and it was because the material was strong, the production was killer and because it was Iron Maiden! RECOMMENDED+music
Bummer---Barely Average+N+Well, I gave this CD its first spin after a two year absence of ANY Ricky Martin music in my life. After his 1999 self-title CD, I pretty much went head over heals for Ricky. When this CD came out in November of 2000 I was really excited. Upon first listening to it, I thought it was better than his 99 CD but no where near as good as Vuelve. It would take 2003's Almas Del Silencio to really wash way the bad taste in my mouth that this CD leaves.   As several folks know, Ricky was under pressure from his managers, producers and the record company to deliver a follow up to his 1999 CD. Sound Loaded is what we got. This album was obviously rushed and it sounds like it. Weak lyrics and over saturation of musical gimicks is utilzed to keep the 'Livin La Vida Loca' fever burning. Ricky's voice just sounds tired and worn out. It's easy to tell that he was way over due for a vacation.   There are a few standout tracks on the disc. 'Amor' by far out shines every song by a mile. Had Sound Loaded had more great tunes like 'Amor' on it, the CD would have been a hit. As it is, the CD is mediocre at best.+music
classic????+N+This is authentic, classic, timeless poo. hot and fresh from the gut!!!+music
A fantastic set of music+P+This is a hard swinging Blue Note session from the late 50's. It features a classic line up of Clark on piano, John Coltrane on tenor, Curtis Fuller on trombone, Donald Byrd on trumpet, Paul Chambers on bass, and Art Taylor  on drums. All of the artists are comfortable in the session and no one  musician dominates the set. The selections are arranged as to give everyone  room to stretch and explore the collection of standards and Clark  originals. Sonny's light, nimble touch is on display throughout the  session. His solos are well worth listening to several times and swing on  each track. Curtis Fuller has a warm, tender solo on the standard Come Rain  Or Come Shine, and Coltrane shines on Speak Low. Everyone gets room to blow  on the uptempo opening track, With a Song in My Heart, with Byrd's bright  brassy trumpet leading the way. Finally, Clark's compositional skills shine  thru on the classic that closes the set, News For Lulu. This is another  great Blue Note &quot;Connoisseur&quot; reissue of a &quot;lost  classic&quot;, it gets one star automatically for putting all of the  alternates at the end of the album instead of stringing them behind the  master takes. I recommend this set as a classic straight ahead swinging  hard bop date, especially to fans of the &quot;Blue Note sound&quot+music
A must for those who love lyrics+P+This containes some of Greg Brown's finest writing, it is however different from his most of his other recordings. This is a dark look at American culture without being melodramatic. I purchased this one after adding one of his finest efforts &quot;The Poet Game&quot; to my collection, and I find lyrically to be amongst his best work. Highlights include 3 unique tracks &quot;The Monkey&quot;, &quot;One Cool Remove&quot;, and &quot;America Will Eat You&quot;. Other Greg Brown albums that I purchased after this one (quite a few) although they were great, did not quite rate as high on my list+music
Ultimate Dolly Parton CD+P+I am very pleased with this CD and I received it quickly. Recommend this seller highly.+music
BEST BAND IN THE WORLD+P+My favourite group of music makers ever.. The album did not dissappoint.. thank you Amazo+music
Great sound track+P+I have seen many anime's and this one has a really good soundtrack for the Hack Liminality anime's.  This is for there ps2 game series.  Even though the game+anime isn't available in the us this is a soundtrack to buy.  Comes with some techno, and great choir soundtracks in latin I thin+music
Detaching The World Vol.1+N+I purchased this after reading the reviews, I was surprised when I received it.  Hated it, I found it quite disturbing to listen to+music
A Hidden Gem+P+It seems that many want to place Kim Richey in a box and she just doesn't seem to fit in one.  Like Shawn Colvin, she is someone who just has her own category.  This is actually my favorite of all the Kim Richey I own, followed by "Bitter Sweet" and "Rise".  My favorite song on "Glimmer" is "Didn't I" and the title song is great as well.  Give this one a try and enjoy.+music
Michelle Branch rocks!+P+I got this yesterday for Christmas after hearing the song, " You Set Me Free" used on the Ice Princess Soundtrack, and i love it! Well, most of it. Here's my review of The Spirit Room.  1. Everywhere- 9/10- A fun and upbeat song. Pretty good, love the intro to it.   2. You Get Me- 5/10- It's pretty, but just too slow to me. Maybe it'll grow on me eventually.   3. All You Wanted- 10/10- The BEST on the album. Love it! Was this a single? If not, it definalty should have been.   4. You Set Me Free- 10/10- Like i already wrote, I got this CD after hearing this song on Ice Princess. Really good and fun to sing to.   5. Something to Sleep To- 7/10- OK. You should listen to it if you want to go to sleep. I still think it's OK.  6. Here With Me- 9/10- Love the beginning and the chorus. It seems like a really good song for a party.  7. Sweet Misery- 6/10- OK also. I just don't really like how the chorus is and it's too short.  8. If Only She Knew- 10/10- Fun and cool. One of my favorites.   9. I'd Rather Be in Love- 7/10- Sounds alot like Sweet Misery.  10. Goodbye to You- 8/10- This is a really pretty song about moving on in life.  11. Drop in the OCean- I don't really get this song. I'm not going to rate it.  Overall, this CD gets an A. It's pretty good. I think you should buy it+music
Brixton+P+Awesome! A classic Faith No More Album. It will blow you away. Supreme war  pigs cover showing just how heavy FNM can be. Even sports a little comic  relief by doing a New kids on the block tun+music
NY DJ's  can't all be great+N+Once again Ultra records has put it's trust into New York DJ's, and the results are not pleasing.  Disc one mixed by Vic Latino from NYC is good enough for radio (stick to KTU) but not for the higher standards set by the UK DJ's who are always well ahead of the game. Bad song choices and even worse mix choices make Disc 1 a failure.   Disc 2 mixed by The Riddler, also a NYC DJ is a vast improvment and he should be commended on his effort and this just proves not all DJ's from NYC are all bad. Better song choices here more on the Trance side but with enough vocal power to keep you moving. This Disc will be the one you play the most.  But for the money it's still a deal. I've liked Ultra's Trance CD's alot better, but if your looking for real club music stay with a proven winner and check out Ministry Of Sound, you can't go wrong with any of their CD'+music
Disappointing+N+I was excited when I heard about this.  Sorry, I can't handle it.  Bare, buddy, you should stay in retirement if this is going to be the result of your new efforts+music
80's still rule+N+Proof a hot chick with a decent voice can destroy a synth-pop hit from a better era of music. Though it's really the sound of the music that is lacking in Gwen's version, so I can't blame her for the disaster.  The original still rules+music
HORRIBLE+N+This is a horrible CD!  It was like nails on a chalkboard listening to it then I finally had enough and took it out of my player and threw it away.  There may have been 3 songs on this CD that were actually OK, but the rest of it were these obscure songs that came from under a rock somewhere. +music
recomended+P+2day i just ordered this cd from barns and noble! cant wait til it comes in! i love the songs surrender and all night long! i also recomend the fallowing cds and artists,everytime we touch by cascada,a fever you cant sweat out by panic! at the disco,1on 1 by rupee,decemberunderground by afi,greatest hits by ace of base,flyleaf by flyleaf,sound advice by shapeshifters,and end of gray by decyfer down! buy them all+music
Short as an old 33 1/3 r.p.m.  +N+Most of these songs are classic, but the disc is too short for it's own good. Clocking in at 35:48 with only 12 songs. Ouch! Well, I guess you can look at it like an old 33 1/3 rpm. Just hit the pause button after track 6. Take a deep breath or go to the bathroom or fix a drink. Then hit the play button.  But seriously, there are so many countless trinkets missing from a collection called, "20th Century Masters: The Best of the Andrews Sisters, The Millennium Collection," wow, that's a bit long winded. But, with a title like that you ought to have Rhumboogie, Beer Barrel Polka, Well Alright, Straighten Up And Fly Right, Rumors Are Flying, etc. Don't get me wrong, it's a nice introduction but just too short.   Buyer beware!  Finally, why can't these compilations of old 78's have a few more seconds between them? Essentially we have a bunch of singles all crammed together, so why not let them have some breathing room. As I recall, the UK Beatles albums from 1963-1966 had a seven second break between songs. I loved it! It was like giving each song it's own spotlight. Oh, the days of one song at a time.+music
CASH MONEY STILL FALLING INSTEAD OF BALLING+N+YO THIS JOINT IS WACK. ITS A WASTE OF TIME I DON'T WHY I BROUGHT IT. YOUR BEST BET IS TO WAIT FOR LIL WEEZEE TO DROP HIS NEXT ALBUM. HE IS CASH MONEY NOW. SINCE JUVE HAS LEFT MAYBE THE REST OF THE HOT BOYS SHOULD CONSIDER IT TOO MICKEY AND LAC ARE JUST PLAIN WACK. MANNIE FRESH HAS BEEN SURPASSED BY THE LIKES OF TIMBERLAND, NEPTUNES,TRACK MASTERS HIS BEATS JUST CAN'T COMPETE ANYMORE. CASH MONEY SHOULD LOOK INTO LETTING SOMEONE ELSE DO THEIR TRACKS INSTEAD OF MANNIE DOING THE WHOLE ALBUM BECAUSE HE HAS LOST HIS TOUCH+music
THIS IS THE STUFF RIGHT HERE!+P+I BOUGHT THIS BECAUSE I WAS TRYING EXPAND MY HORIZONS, YOU KNOW? CULTURALLY AND MENTALLY, YOU KNOW? SERIOUSLY THOUGH I WAS IN THE SHOP AND I WAS HAVING A GAZE AROUND THE PLACE AND THEN THIS PICTURE JUST JUMPS OUT AT ME, AND I PICKED IT UP AND IT WAS THIS DEBUSSY CHAP AND ID HEARD ABOUT HIM ON THE BBC LEARNING ZONE SO I THOUGHT ;why not?; SERIOUSLY THOUGH I DRAGGED IT HOME AND I POPPED IT IN THE OLD CD PLAYER AND IT FLOORED ME.......I MEAN SERIOUSLY THIS THING...AMAAZING STUFF..I MEAN TODAYS MUSIC HAS NOTHING, NOTHING NOTHING ON THIS STUFF RIGHT HERE.   SOME GOOD TRACKS ARE: TRACK 1 IS THE BEST. THE OPENING FLUTE ON THE TRACK IS TOTALLY CHILLED AND COOL, REMINDS ME A BIT OF TRACK 13 ON ILL COMMUNICATION BY THE BEASTIE BOYS...A COINCIDENCE???  THE ONLY WEAK TRACK ON THE ALBUM IS TRACK 6, THE UNFORTUNATELY TITLED "CHILDRENS CORNER SUITE: GOLLIWOGGS CAKE WALK" THE MUSIC IS JUST DATED MAN, JUST AS DATED AS THE TITLE.  OVERALL THOUGH THIS IS A QUALITY ALBUM, WITH CHILLS, SPILLS AND THRILLS. SERIOUSLY THOUGH A FINE EFFORT+music
Wailers sophomore album+P+This 1973 follow up to the Wailers debut `Catch A Fire' is mainly a collection of updated singles that had been doing the rounds on the Jamaican underground scene for years. `Get Up, Stand Up' and `I Shot The Sheriff' are two of the most hitting cuts the Wailers ever recorded, but the rest of the material doesn't have the same mass appeal of their other albums. This is more an album for hardcore fans of reggae than the general audience. It's a cool set but `Burnin' isn't an album I can bump too much+music
"Something's lost, but something's gained..."+P+This CD contains both studio re-recordings of earlier works ("Judas", "Dandelion", "Anna", etc.) as well as new songs.  I have some sympathy for Ben Fassett's earlier comment.  Those who have heard Antje Duvekot's earlier works ("Little Peppermints" and "Boys, Flowers, Miles") may be surprised by her sound in this CD.   I was fortunate enough to hear her live in concert the other night, and was completely impressed by her presence and performance.  Her earlier CDs convey the power of her solo performance; think Patty Griffin's "Living with Ghosts" as a comparable example.  Paradoxically, less is more.    This CD, on the other hand, adds string arrangements and other instruments to her voice and guitar.  I think that some of the raw emotion and poignancy can get lost in the production, and her voice can occasionally be muted.  In her concert, she performed some of the new songs from this CD, and they were very much in the style of her earlier CDs.  The earlier CDs also reveal her live demeanor which is quite shy, humorous and self-deprecating.  You should really try to see her in person if you have a chance.  On the other hand, this CD represents more Antje Duvekot, and that is never a bad thing.  It is still well worth the purchase, but consider also "Boys, Flowers, Miles" to hear the power of her solo voice+music
wow!!!+P+I've already listened to samples of her new CD.Its even better than her first one!!! More rock in it! anyways this is an amazing debut album.I love it the way to begin and anticonformity are the best songs on the CD+music
Better than amazon reviews seem to think it is.+P+I'm reviewing this to raise the avg. star rating.  I think this is a decent piece of work that is not intended to be listened to in one sitting.  The songs are kinda slow grooves that remind me a lot of Traffic at times; funk keyboards wash over the whole thing and the vocals are almost inaudible whispers.  I'm not sure what place this kind of music holds in the industry, in society, among fellow musicians.  I only know that it doesn't deserve a three star avg, though it all kind feels like one big song, it's a real cool, groovy song+music
I don't understand+P+I don't understand what the previous &quot;reviewer&quot; was talking about, that miles was playing it square here. This is a beautiful, relaxed album, and one of the only quartet recordings miles did. Plus, he plays the  open trumpet on every tune. He made this album when he was waking up from  his blue haze of heroin addiction, right before he went on to huge fame and  success and you can hear all his new ideas formulating on this record.  However, if you're only accustomed to later Miles Davis records where he  was fueled by fiery tenormen like Shorter and Coltrane, then maybe it might  sound too laid back for you. I dunno+music
Guitar legend's debut.+N+In many ways a relic of its era, "Not of This Earth" is the first widely distributed release by Joe Satriani (a previous EP ended up being reissued as part of "Time Machine", years later).  The guitarist, supported by drummer Jeff Campitelli and percussionist John Cuniberti came into public attention when Steve Vai, a former student of Satriani, ended up singing his teacher's praises in the music press.  The result is that this album, more than likely to have been lost in the shuffle of instrumental rock music, received wider recognition and poised Satriani to explode into a bonafide celebrity on his next record.  The album itself is a bit uneven-- Satriani is a flawlessly brilliant guitarist, but as a songwriter, he wasn't quite ready.  Several pieces ("Not of This Earth", "Hordes of Locusts") seem to run out of steam before they end, and a couple ("The Snake", "Driving At Night") feel like bad '80s metal.  On the other hand, several pieces shine-- delicate and lovely "Rubina", reggaeish and emotionally soaked "Memories", and the overtly Frippesque "New Day" are all fine examples of what Satriani is capable of.  But my favorite is probably "Brother John", where Satriani abandons all his effects and performs his delicate and bubbly melody cleantone.  In the end, the album is ok, but Satriani would go on to do so much more interesting in the future.  Come back to this one if you've picked up a bunch of other stuff and are looking for more, but most should start with "Surfing With the Alien"+music
no?+N+so i really liked new nathan detroits...i kept listening, hoping for more.  what i got was a listless drone of alternative sounding chords and alkaline trio style vocals.  i suppose i didnt give the album much of a chance... but when i have to stop listening to it twice because it bores me so much, i dont feel like i need to.  the album appeared to have potential...but nothing stuck out except for the first track.  everything just ran together, and it was difficult to seperate any sort of melody in any of the songs.  compared to all the other reviews, i am apparently missing something, but i didnt like it.  i heard it directly after listening to appleseed casts' &quot;end of the ring wars&quot;, which was amazing.  so i guess would recomend that over this anyday.  i will give this album another chance, simply because everyone else seems to like it so much, but as for right now, it gets a big juicy thumbs down+music
Soul Patrol+P+Normaly this isn't my type of music but he is so great at it I had to buy i+music
MA-AN!  Too much talent for the spoiled youth to bear...+P+I have good instincts, folks.  Just like all of you who've already givin' this a glowing review.  I checked this out from the library a few days ago and was immediately FLOORED.  So much so that I'm thinking about not reteurning it; telling them I lost it an' just paying for it.  I'm amazed at the gracefulness that comes across when you put together two so distinct an' so DIFFERENT voices.  Louis' scratchy, gruff, yet likeable an' melodic croon an' Ella's smooth-as-silk, soothing an' intoxicating voice incredibly, to me, go PERFECTLY on these duets here.  From that first opener 'Let's Call the Whole Thing off', done so sly an' flirtatious on both parts, to 'Gee, Baby, Ain't I Good to You' to the ever-engaging 'Autumn in New York' and 'Stars Fell on Alabama' one of the GREATEST standards EVER written ("And in the center just you and me, My heart beat like a hammer, My arms wound around you tight, And stars fell on Alabama last night").  THAT is what romance is, kiddies!  Oh, an' I can't forget 'Summertime'.  Ahhh, yes, 'Summertime', with that opening trumpet that tugs at your heart strings and makes you wish for days of love, happiness, sunlights an' flowers; a world of beauty that should never be taken for granted.  Yeah, I know what you're thinkin'; "there he goes, layin' it on thick again."  Well, I can't help it.  In a time filled with the most repugnant excuses for music I've ever heard in all my soon-to-be twenty-five years, it is a shining gift that this music has been preserved for us who TRULY appreciate talent and genius.  There's no show-boating here, no bone-headed braggadocio, no studio gimmicks.  THIS is what music is. +music
Rosemary Clooney missing ... arrangements not the usual!+N+If you're a fan of either "Holiday Inn" or "White Christmas" you really, really should avoid this one.  Its recording quality not only offers substandard "tin can" sound, but you won't find Rosemary Clooney on a single track from White Christmas.    This is not a soundtrack.  It's a studio version of songs that sound familiar from the movies but were not performed this way on screen.  Disappointing to say the least, as me and mine are avid fans of these Christmas-themed films.  The two stars I've placed here are generous, but I couldn't move down to one ... "hate" doesn't fit.  I am, however, not keeping this CD.  Too depressing and not at all what I hoped to hear.  If you're a true fan of the films, these recordings won't be what you hope to hear, either.  Good luck in finding the real thing! +music
Great Southern Hard Melodic Rock+P+This band is a great pick-up, especially if you like bands like Shinedown or Tantric.  At times, I wish there was more guitar parts on the album, but its a very solid, safe, and well produced release.  nothing ground breaking, but a great listen that will be in my changer for weeks to come+music
Amazing Melodic Death Metal+P+This is in my opinion the best performace from Anders. He mixes his higher pitched vocals found prominatly on the newer albums with the classic Melo Death vocals found on earlier albums. There is also some low talking thrown in a few songs, Bullet Ride being one of them. Musically, while its not their best, it is very good. Similar to the vocals they mix old and new sound on this CD to create a masterpiece. Pounding and yet melodic guitar work is the In Flames trademark. Also, Daniel's drumming on this album is probably his finest hour, a standout for him being Brush the Dust Away.  Stand out tracks overall are:  Bullet Ride Pinball Map Square Nothing Brush the Dust Away  All the songs on here are awesome those are just my favorites. This is a good CD for newcomers because it isnt too much like the old or new and its a great mix.  All in all, this is not only one of my favorite CDs from In Flames, but all time as well+music
Wank fest in your face.+N+I am a huge Mars fan, but this is just bore.  I was really looking forward to a cd representive of their live shows, but this is a horrible excuse for a live album from anyone especially from Mars Volta. I am all for experimentation, but if you look at the liner notes there are a ton of non-band members jerkin' off on this after the original recording and personally coming from a recording and engineering backround it is not creative or good.  It seems like a bad painting. Save your money and buy bootleg of their actual live show.+music
What else can be said+P+Who knows how different the history of music as we know it would be like without this genius.  Every blues musician since and many classic rock bands owe him a huge debt.  This is a must for any music collection+music
Beautiful!!+P+This is a finely crafted album, it's just beautiful. Background harmonies from Dolly Parton, Emmylou Harris, Ricky Skaggs, Vince Gill, Amy Grant, Trisha Yearwood.... Patty is fantastic on her own, but with these voices blended in, something special was created.+music
The height of an amazing career+P+Some artists are good enough that to label one work as their best says more than a lot.  Nick Cave is by all means one of them.  And 'Your Funeral...My Trial' is that golden release.  Beginning with the slow title cut, it moves it's way through track after track, sometimes menacing, sometimes violent, sometimes beautiful, and always thought provoking and dark.  Highlights?  Honestly, all of them.  Warning, this album is Nick's least accesable and that says a lot too.  But after a few good listens, it works it's way into your brain and it's the best thing since ever- I promise+music
Excellent!+P+This 16-song compilation of western swing includes: San Antonio Rose, Lilly Dale, Texas Two Step, and Big Ball in Cowtown.  http://www.cowgirls.com EN+music
Have you heard of Javier Solis?+N+By far nothing comparable to Javier Solis. Not taking anything away from the tenor of OPERA not Ranchera...Lets leave the rancheras for those who are gifted in its style.  You want real rancheras listen to MR. Javier Solis+music
Oh Em Gee, What happened Gwen?+N+A giant leap back from Love.Angel.Music.Baby. What was she thinking with this album? This music does not compare at all to L.A.M.B. and her No Doubt days. 'The Sweet Escape' (song) is very successful on the charts, ...and I honestly don't understand why. It's so generic and 'woo hoo' part is so annoying. The album is a one star but I'll give her two because I still love Gwen+music
Lou's Last Gem..+P+This is the last really good album that Lou Reed made in 1990. He captures the feel of his New York and you can visualise what the Dirty Boulevard looks like. Lou is at his best when he plays tough and on New York his hard edged urban lyrics really hit the spot. For Velvet's fans, im going to rate this 3rd of Lou's solo efforts behind Transformer and Take No Prisoners+music
(Rating: 1 out of 10/) This Ain't Even Good Pop Music!+N+Now usually if I know 100% that something is wack, I won't waste my money on it and can just download it for free. Now I wish that I didn't even do that at all. A lot of reviewers seem to have faced the facts: Paris CANNOT SING! This here has proven that clearly. Now that I think about it, what can she do?...other than being a rich [female] who keep her name in the news (That "E!" channel if anyone actually watches that) on something stupid. Now on to this. There is no other explaimation to it except that it sucks. The original song sucks, and the four remixes are even worse, not to mention that some of them are pretty long in length. But lets face the facts; despite many 1 or 2 star reviews, bull [...] music is going to sell. True, if the rap group Dead 4 Life can have a high selling single "Laffy Taffy" and have their album go gold, there is no telling for what numbers Paris Hilton will put up, just because it's her. Easily one of the worst songs I've heard in the past 5 years.   Take my advice: There is halfassed talent out there that is better than this. Also $18 is too much to have something to sit your drinks on. And if this is imported, it should have been confiscated when trying to get through U.S. customs. It's THAT bad!  When songs like this see the light of day, you know that shes doing whatever she can to stay relevant.  Lyrics: F Production: D- Musical Vibes: +music
Boring+N+This band has potential but has zero groove, nothing to latch onto at all. Go see the Sword and leave early, man+music
EXCELLENT BUYING EXPERIENCE!!!!+P+Great price, fast delivery, CD in excellent condition!  What more could you ask for??!+music
Heartbreakingly Beautiful+P+Michael Hoppe is a treasure. From his earliest recordings until his latest, Requiem, I have never been disappointed. Solace does not have one track that you will skip over. The soloists, where there are vocals, are superb and speak straight to the heart. Occasionally we are given a musical gift that lasts us a lifetime. This is one of those gifts. Therese Tappouni  Writer, Workshop Director, author of A Time to Reap and Walking Your Walk, a Woman's Guide to a Spirit Filled Life+music
Save Your Money Folks!+N+Save your money unless YOU TRULY ARE A FAN OF CHICAGO! The only tracks I listen to are HARD HABIT TO BREAK and IF YOU'RE LEAVING NOW. The other tracks really didn't do anything for me. I would say that a more complete volume of "best of" would probably be a better choice+music
Much better that anything Tool ever did+N+Yeah, man. I used to be like really stupid. I got bad grades in school. But then I started listening to Modest Mouse's music and I was like, "whoa!" and now I'm really smart, and no one is smarter than me in my whole school, including the teachers! They should market "Lonesome Crowded West" on TV as a way to get kids to do better in school, because it makes you intelligent. It's a scientific fact! All you people who give this album a negative review whould go and listen again, because some times you have to listen more than once. And if you still don't get it after like 30 listens, then listen 30 more, because listening that much to a rock and roll band is in no way pathetic. Besides, being a Modest Mouse fan makes you a card carrying member of the special club, where you get to talk about Modest Mouse and the sophistication and about how Isaac Brock's childhood was so tragic and nothing like that has ever happened to anyone else and how now he's my god and astrology and Modest Mouse chatrooms and Modest Mouse T-Shirts and Modest Mouse CDs and books off the Modest Mouse website and how horrible capitalism is. Don't you wanna be a member of the club?   This CD has changed my life completely. I used to have no friends and I spent a lot of time in my parent's basement. And now.... well, I still don't have friends and I live in my parent's basement, but the people online understand that I "get" how Modest Mouse's music is an excellent replacement for the voids in my life that otherwise would have been filled with girlfriends and thinking (yuch!!!!!!!!!!!). And that one song where Isaac says, "My thoughts weren't so loud" is like, so true, because we live in a democracy which just let's the man hold Isaac back. What we need to do is set up socialism, with Isaac at the top and he'll provide for the rest of us and we never have to get jobs because he's so talented. He's like, outgrown his fans, too. Except me. Like, some days, I listen to "This is a Long Drive for Someone With Nothing to Think About" which is an awesome title because it's so long it's like a sentence and I'm so cool and smart because I get that. Well, I didn't really get that on my own, but I was the one who pushed the buttons while I was on the internet, in between visits to the Modest Mouse messageboard of course. But some days, I listen to the album and cry out in wonder at the height of my sophistication for listening and enjoying such a unique group, and I feel so accomplished and brilliant and that isn't a waste of a day at all. And then I go onto another album, like "The Moon and Antarctica" (I didn't even know you could seen the moon from down there!!!!!!!) and I link all the geographcial and astronomical references and I learn a lot that week. And then I listen to that bootleg I got and then the DVD I got off ebay from another guy who "gets Modest Mouse" and suddenly I've spent a year putting all these things together from the lyrics and I'm like "Whoa, I thought I was smart before, but now I'm REALLY smart," you know, because I've spent so much time listening to Modest Mouse and talking about Modest Mouse on the internet, and suddenly it's been, like five years, which is perfect because that's how often my gods put out an album. It's odd I haven't realized yet that I've completely dedicated myself to a ROCK BAND and all my money, opportunity, and life have been paid over to Modest Mouse. It's just a good thing that I think for myself and that I'm so different from all the other Modest Mouse fans that do the exact same thing I do. Yep, good thing.   j5w2k9@hotmail.com+music
Live is best+N+This Was Joe Walsh in his Prime, when he was really Rockin' If your A james Gang fan, and you like live music, you really should own this "CD"!  (Joe at some of his best!!!)+music
They suck.+N+Thousand Foot Krutch suck in my opinion.  I bought this CD hoping to find a good band but I found a band I really do not like.  It is just not the type of music I like to listen too.  But it is not good to always base your opinion on people who may not like the same music as you so you should try it out and give it a try i really just dont like it+music
Wimpy, maybe...but I don't care.+P+For those who need their music to be deep and thought provoking, then maybe this album isn't for you. For those who just want good melodic pop songs that crawl inside your head, then this is definitely for you. I play it from beginning to end without skipping a song. Also contains Deperate Fools which ranks among my all-time Carmen favorites. Unlike most other solo material, there is a hint of disco in a few of the songs. In my opinion, 8 of these songs are B+ with the final cut an A++music
Nostalgic, wimpy pop+N+I grew enamored with Eric Carmen's music, drawn in by not only the many honest, complicated emotions of his first two solo albums (especially Boats Against The Current) but also by the occasionally hard-hitting pop of The Raspberries.  I got away from Carmen's work for a long time, but recently have been relistening to the old LP's and gave Change of Heart a spin.  After hearing it again, I was surprised at three things.  First, most songs seemed half-baked, with the chorus on most making a quick appearance and then repeating endlessly.  These are short songs, devoid of development and any compositional reach.  Second, the production seemed both overdone and timid at the same time.  Overdone in the all-star backing musicians (Danny Kortchmar! Leland Sklar!  Nigel Olsson!  Burton Cummings!  Jeff Porcaro!) playing very simple stuff.  Overdone in the too-thick orchestration.  Timid like the hand claps and piano glissandos on "Hey Deanie" and other examples throughout the album.  Finally, I was surprised by the brevity.  Only 8 tunes, with a syrupy orchestral variation on the title track.  Again, underlining the overall theme of an uninspired, tired work+music
Boring, but she has a nice voice+N+I thought the album was boring.  I didn't watch Nashville Star but I'm a big country music fan and I like to listen to new artists.  I bought the cd and loved the catchy song "I Break Things".  The other songs really didn't grab me, even after several listens.  I was disappointed in her cover of "I'm Not Lisa"- although Erika Jo has a beautiful voice, I found the rendition lacking emotion.  She's a good singer but I hope her next album has some better material+music
If you saw Dig!, buy this album with confidence.+P+I heard about these guys from that movie, Dig!, and I didn't know what to expect. Turns out, they're amazing. There's no comparison to the Dandy Warhols, none. Why they thought they were in competition with a hack band with a few hooks is beyond me. These guys are the real deal. If it wasn't for their lead singer making a jerk of himself and screwing up record deals (which is a storyline that you won't understand once you hear the thoughtful lyrics), these guys would be widely known as one of the best bands in the world. They sound like a throwback from the 60's, but slightly updated. The music is varied and intelligent as anything you've heard. I guess The Rolling Stones might be an apt comparison, but there's something more raw about this band. Look, if you were on the fence, just buy this, you won't be disappointed+music
Going and going...+P+It has been roughly one year since this album was released. As of today, I still find myself listening to it regularly, as this cd just has classic written all over it. The opening pair of songs are  nothing more than tastes of what is in store for the listener.  Queens of the Stone Age may not have Nick Oliveri in it, but you can tell that this cd still kicks. All of the elements fall into play, creating a cohesive piece of music that captures your mind. You will find yourself rocking out with Medication and Someone's in the Wolf. You may find yourself singing along to the singles Little Sister and In my Head. You may find yourself lamenting to Long Slow Goodbye and I Never Came. In fact, there is not one bad track on this album.  This one can be considered an overview of the band's output from their inceptiion to today, as most of the songs sound like they could be from another album. That is why this one is amazing. It is definitely Queens. It has the stoner grove from the first record, the pop elements from the second and the heavy parts from the previous effort. It also hints at what's in storage for us fans in the future.  Lullabies is utterly amazing. The high quality of the songs, as well as the tendency for you to hit the repeat button suggest this one to be a modern classic. It is the kind of cd that our kids will be listening to in about 20 years. Do yourself a favor. Pick it up. NOW+music
"Hank Penny" it's time to pay him his dues!+P+Back in the 40's and 50's (even the 30's going back to Milton Brown and Bob)Western Swing was in a class all it's own. Either you loved it or not,in most cases there was no inbetween. Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys swore to Great Fame as did Bob's steel player Leon. Milton Brown who started it all would of ruled the roost if not for his early death in the late 30's. Spade Cooley was a real favorite even had a TV show and at one time was bigger then them all except he ended up doing time for a murder rap. He was the first to coin the phrase "Western Swing". Over the years there were many others like Curly Williams,Tex Williams,Elton Brittand Pee Wee King to name a few.But when I want to hear some of the finest Swing music from who I believe to be the Greastest Western Swing song writer as well as artist there is only one choice,"Hank Penny and his Radio Cowboys". Hank is about the most under rated Country and Western artist ever to go on the stage. His music is second to none and his lyrics can stop a coon in it's tracks! If you want to really get the best music that Hank ever put out it is essential to get this CD"Crazy Rhytm" along with his 2CD set "King of Hillbilly Bebop". Both of these sets will open a whole new world of Western Swing to any listener. If you never heard of Hank Penny or heard his music you are in for a treat. His lead female singer was the great Jaye P. Morgan who had great fame in the 50's and 60's as a crooner. I admit that this music is not for everyone and i would bet that only about 10% of todays so called Country Music enthusiasts will apperciate this goldmine of classics. Hits like "Flamin'Mamie" and "Peroxide Blond" are some of the best "Hillbilly" music that will ever be recorded. "Wide Open Spaces" and "Little Red Wagon" are classics that only Hank could pull off.This is the real thing if your love of music is like mine (my wife has adopted "Western Swing"as one of her favorite sounds also). Again please keep in mind if your idea of Country Music is watching some half baked,half naked, B-girl, bimbo on a perverted modern video that they now show on TV singing worthless songs that sound no more Country then Perry Como ,but just like pop hits from the 70's then this classic music ain't for you,believe me it ain't. If your idea of enjoying music is sitting back and listening to Ernest Tubb singing "I'm like Driftwood on the River of Regret" then I'm certain you will dig Hank!                              "Enjoy" Joe Kopec+music
Atmosphere is Emo-Rap+N+Let me start by saying that I thought that Atmosphere's early albums were much better(Most of Atmosphere's current fans have no idea that they had other albums...)But Seven's Travels is Slug and Ant's transformation into a crappy sell-out group, and the first ever emo-rap group. The people that love this album are always some teenager, usually some emo-kid, who decide they like rap and Atmosphere after hearing this album. They jump onto the official Atmosphere bandwagon, but dont think that they listen to rap...they listen to "rap". These emo-rap kids love to talk about how much mainstream rap sucks and how much better Atmosphere is, and how underground is the best. (Dont think from this that I am a fan of mainstream rap, i'm just explaining)The number one sign you can tell from, even by just looking at these reviews, is if they start talking about how mainstream sucks(Naturally, these teenage kids like to be different, and can't stop talking about it)or how this is real true rap music. So, basically, these kids are part of the underground hip-hop backpacking club who love the only Atmosphere album they've ever heard, Sevens Travels and live out their little emo lives listening to Atmosphere(for about 3 months). Even if these people listen to Atmosphere's other albums ( which would totally make them the ultimate Atmosphere super-fan!)it makes no difference because Atmosphere is a crappy emo-rap group now. The purpose of this is to inform people that listen to real hip-hop that this album is not for them and that its for  emotionally-disturbed teenagers. Go buy some real hip-hop, and we can all let the emo-kids cry themselves to sleep listening to Sevens Travels+music
Enduring Christmas favorites+P+This year for our church Christmas concert, we are doing a collection of Michael W. Smith's Christmas music.  To my delight, two of the songs - Emmanuel and Christmas Hymn - were ones I fell in love with twenty years ago while listening to this collection on cassette.  Warm and bright, and still as fresh now as it was in the early 80's, this is still one of my favorite Amy Grant albums AND one of my favorite Christmas albums+music
Good.+P+I didn't find this CD to be as fabulous as careless love but, still enjoy it+music
Delightful G & S+P+My favourite performance of this classic Gilbert & Sullivan Operetta. Kevin Kline, Linda Ronstat, and the whole cast are perfect+music
maybe "you had to be there..."+N+I can't imagine why Mr. Andriessen's new opera Writing to Vermeer is garnering so much praise -- maybe "you had to be there." On CD, however, it's a grating, annoying, and self-consciously postmodern trial to endure... in fact, I finally had to just give up about halfway through the second disc. Life is too short, after all.+music
Beautiful Piece of Audio Art+P+As I said just above, this is a prime example of what I like to call Audio Art. From the dynamio begginning to the story song ending it is a great album through and through. It is more electric then their debut release but it's a welcomed change. Not that the debut was bad. The songs tell tales of broken hearts and the story song carries along a nice message of anti-suicide which is a welcome break from other bands out there.  I give it five stars because the music flows together so well, the quality is magnificent and the whole album is so through out and well laid that it deserves nothing less+music
Inconsistent.+N+Following up a critically acclaimed debut is probably one of the hardest things that an artist can do, and more often than not, the album falls well short of expectations, because they're so highly elevated.  "Whip-Smart" is a decent, albeit somewhat inconsistent album, but its pales in comparison to "Exile in Guyville", and that unfortunately is how it will always be thought.  Probably the most important thing about "Whip-Smart" is that its not Exile Part 2, while some songs maintain that sort of lo-fi sound/overt lyric gig that the previous record got so much mileage from ("X-Ray Man", "Crater Lake"), the album actually does best when it drifts further away from the territory of Exile-- from the noise guitar over the familiar melody of "Chopsticks" to the haunting, moody, "Shane', where the tension is almost palpable to the brilliant, chugging "Jealousy".  Like Exile, it excels when the tension is at its highest, unlike Exile, its a lot brighter sounding.  Still, for all the good stuff on here, it sounds like Phair wasn't quite ready to issue a followup.  Several experiments in different veins sound incomplete ("Alice Springs"), fall apart ("Support System", "Go West") or are plain irritating ("Cinco de Mayo", "May Queen").  Its got its moments, but "Whip-Smart" is largely disposable-- start with Phair's debut, "Exile in Guyville", its everything its regarded as+music
Two Dog Night --Maybe+N+I have to admit, like others, I bought this CD just because I was excited to have another collection of Three Dog Night songs.  I was so disappointed when I played it and realized it was really only two dogs.  Without Chuck, there is no Three Dog Night.  They can package it the same way, call it by the same name, but it's not.  These vocals are nothing more than lack luster covers of the originals, certainly not the wonderful vocals we have come to know and love.  I agree with another reviewer here...why can't they listen to the words of "Easy to be Hard" and patch things up?  If the Eagles can do it, the Dogs should be able to as well.  Eager fans are waiting for some new harmony!  Oh yeah, and this CD, I threw it away+music
Do You Know Who "Kyle West" REALLY  Was/Is?.....Teddy Riley Of Guy!+P+I KID YOU NOT!..he ghost wrote 7 of the 15 tracks on private times for Al B. Sure..ask yourself this question: how come you never actually saw a picture of Kyle West?...Hmm?  Overall,a really good album.i wouldn't recommend buying the first one but this one i do :) +music
Blistering Images in Rhyme+P+This is Bob Dylan at his very finest and this is probably his best record, from "Like a Rolling Stone" to the album's closer, "Desolation Row," the listener is assaulted with blistering images in rhyme that she will never forget. Dylan changed the shape of the musical landscape with this record, changed rock and roll forever. His songs broke the three minute mold, they weren't about love and love lost anymore. In fact some of them are darned hard to understand, but they stay with you none the less. Bob Dylan was, and is, the poet laureate of Rock and Roll, the poet laureate of America. Love after we're all gone, his lyrics will be sung, recited, read+music
Fans of Paul or Gerry or sax in jazz will enjoy this reissue+P+&quot;Two of a Mind&quot; is a studio-only project from the summer of 1962. Desmond had done a record led by Gerry several years prior, and it was Mulligan's turn to play with Paul on a project he would control. Because of heavy workloads, the two principals collaborated in three separate sessions during June, July and August in New York. Also due to scheduling difficulties, the rhythm section changed at each session. On the six tunes which made the original LP, there are three different bassists and two different drummers. Also on the six LP selections, Desmond did a little studio trickery: some of the improvised solos were put together from different sessions, and on one tune he overdubbed a third saxophone for one verse. If you didn't know this, however, you'd never guess it. The counterpoint improvs of Gerry on baritone and Paul on alto are consistently interesting. Overall the disc is more uptempo than Desmond's other work as a leader. The product lacks that special magic which can often be found on a good recording by a quartet which plays live together and often, but it is a subtle loss. This reissue adds five bonus tracks, including two with guitarist Jim Hall which did not make Desmond's final list for LP inclusion, but which are quite nice. The two leads are highly skilled, and they seemed to like each other a lot and to bring out good things for one another. Not Desmond's best work by a long shot, nor Mulligan's, but worth owning if you are partial to either man. I'm glad BMG is doing these Bluebird First Edition releases from the RCA vaults. The booklets are usually quite good. They come in cardboard cases instead of jewel cases, and I'm not sure if I like that or not yet. Maybe they  could knock a dollar or two off the price and be an even better value, but if, like me, you enjoy the classic jazz of the 1946-'66 generation, you should buy some of these reissues to encourage the company to keep them coming+music
What an album....+P+I listen to a ton of trance artists in the psychadelic/goa esque genre, and I must say that I have yet to hear anything that can even remotely compare to Infected Mushroom. The originality, detail, and craftsmanship that goes into their music is quite frankly amazing. B.P. Empire is one of many amazing Infected Mushroom albums. Generally it is a bit more ambient, and on some tracks possibly a bit more somber than some of their other realeases, but never the less it is a great album. My personal favorite tracks are Noise Maker and P.G.M.. Dancing With Kadafi is a track which is more of an experimental track, which appears to be the birth of the second disc from Converting Vegetarians (which is an experimental or like IM says, &quot;other side&quot; to Infected Mushroom which is like everything else they do, incredible.). Like all Infected Mushroom albums, the quality of the production of B.P. Empire is among incredible. One of the most amazing aspects of Infected Mushroom is their ability to cleanly mix a multitude of synth and percussion sounds simultaneously and make the mix sound tight and refined, and not like a huge mess. They are quite an amazing group, and at the time are probably my favorite artist in any genre. I also find it amazing how many people that I have showed Infected Mushroom to, that don't even listen to trance, are hooked on Infected Mushroom. I highly suggest that you pick up their albums if you love trance and have an open mind. I promise you will not regret it+music
CETACEAN is the only decent track+N+I like what Phil Rogers said about CETACEAN. But to me, CETACEAN doesn't sound surfadelic so much as cheezadelic. As a matter of fact, it's arguably the apotheosis of mod-a-go-go cheezpop. SUSAN doesn't impress me. I don't hear what nicjaytee hears in it.  CJ & The Fish also did a few tracks for a soundtrack called ZACARIAH. And ZACARIAH isn't included at amazon. So allow me to say something about it here. Ya know all of those song lyrics wherein the singer brags about the modesty of his needs? Well, let it be known that Barry Melton wrote a parody of that obnoxious mentality in a tune called ALL I NEED: "All I need to have a good time is a reefer, a woman, and a bottle of wine. With those 3 things I don't need no sunshine. A reefer, a woman, and a bottle of wine. All I want is to never grow old. I want to wash in a bathtub of gold. I want 97 kilos already rolled. I want to wash in a bathtub of gold. I wanna light my cigars with 10-dollars bills. I'd like to have a cattle ranch in Beverly Hills. I'd like a bottle of red-eye that's always filled. I'd like to have a cattle ranch in Beverly Hills.+music
Nothing is worse than a generic power ballad...+N+I really gave this album a chance.  There were even a couple of moments where I thought that a song had a particularly good (in a cheesy way) 80's arena rock riff.  But without fail, even the songs that start out "good", turn into generic forgettable 80's rock -- you know the type that littered the early 80's music scene and all sounded as if it was written by some studio executive and a computer.    I guess there is no accounting for taste, and everyone can have their opinions.  Unless you are REALLY into early 80's power ballads, however, don't even think about getting this album+music
Feh+N+This album is written for people that are emotionally 16 years old and insane.  Every song is from the point of a disenfranchised boy moaning at the world.  The end of 'I'm gonna love her for both of us', when he keeps saying the title with different inflections...don't you just picture Rainman rocking in a corner somewhere?  And if she doesn't love him back, he'll kill her!  Unless she's in bed with a group of his best friends??  No wonder 'Everything is Permitted.'  This is bad.  The production is bad, the tone of the guitar is godawful, Meat's voice sounds worse on this cd than any of his others by far (I know he lost his voice and was doing weird things to try to get it back.  I don't hold it against him, but I'm the one that has to listen to it.)  The band is fine, and I like some of the actual music.  It's the song titles and lyrics that are awful+music
The return of the Massachusetts metal masters!+P+The almighty Unearth has returned to us with a brand new EP entitled Endless. Picking up right where 'The Stings Of Conscience' left off, this Massachusetts metal machine is ready to kick your teeth in once more. First of all the new material is more metal if you can believe that. The song Endless could very well be the greatest hardcore song erver written. The track kicks off with Susi and Mcgrath going absolutly ape... on their axes and Trevor spitting some of the most truthful and inspiring lyrics ever written. The track ends with one of the most monstrous breakdowns I have ever experienced. Awesome .... Internal War is an anti war song and here we witness some absolute sick skin smashing from Mike Rudberg. The pace is fast as Susi and Mcgrath lead the way accompenied by Phipps as he belts out words of truth: 'Power in the wrong hands, our scaffold is destroyed, children killing children cuz the government has ignorned, I sling my arrow to shatter your walls, no more creating victims from ignorance'. I loved The Charm, because its like an old guitar driven eighties metal tune sounding like something  Shadows Fall may write. Once again gutiars fly all over the place and Trevor sounding like a psychotic madman. This is followed with some sick breakdowns and some bad... solos. The last track My Desire also appeared on their full length. I for one do not really dig EPs, but Unearth is one of my favorite bands so I gave em a 5. If you dig any European influenced metalcore or just plain old hardcore, Unearth is the band for you, and I for one can not wait for a new full length+music
one I'd need if stranded on a desert island+P+I never get tired of listening to this CD, and I like all of the songs on it.  His lyrics are so weird and interesting.  The music is so original. Great anywhere... in the car, cleaning the house, during a party, working out, etc+music
Listen once, listen twice.....listen again.+P+I'm always looking for good prog rock, experimental etc...whatever you want to call it. Been listerning since the late 60's early 70's to everything from Zappa, Van Der Graaf, PFM, Genesis, T-heads, Yes ....you get the drift. Bought this CD (like many others I've bought) just to try something new.  My first impression after a few tunes was...guess this ones gonna be collecting dust! But, I stuck to it and listened to the whole CD with an open mind. A lot of little things, quirky things, odd things jumped out at me...some cool melodies, guitar riffs, moments of dissonant chaos followed by structure. Music that I honestly can't say I've heard, or imagined before. Wow! This album has grown on me. I've already bought 3 more or their previous releases and am looking forward to giving in to the unusual and addicting music that is deerhoof+music
Not Worth The Money!!!+N+As much as I like most of the songs on this CD...it's just too short. Also the production is lousy.  The recording quality sounds awful in places. Hopefully, the updated compilations are better. This one is not worth the money!!!+music
Only for U2 fans+N+I am a big U2 fan and I don't really like this.  There are a couple really good songs on it but other than that... not for the average listener+music
All the  best Patsy+P+I've been listining (and singing along) to this album for yaers. It's got all the best Patsy, pure Patsy (not too overloaded with background singers). Just buy it+music
Edgewaters new album+N+The first song is GREAT, but after that the album just doesNOT compare to the first one.  Sorry I bought it.  Too much SCREAMING for me. +music
The Collins CD to buy+P+This is the best ALbert Collins CD you can buy. The guitar playing is amazingly wild. Its one of the great blues albums ever, it certainly has the feeling of a great live seesion in the studio. All the different styles of blues that MR collins played are well represented here: shuffles, slow blues, minor blues, fast sinstrumentals, etc. More satisfying than any compilation. Warning: you'll want more after this+music
Excellent Purchase+N+Thank You for the c.d. in great condition.  We had fast service and would gladly do business with you again.  Thanks again, N and L C+music
RAP CLASSIC+P+This is most possibly the illest rap cd to ever hit stores. The two headed monsta Black C and Mr Cee, along with company, Cellski and Hitman put together pounding beats, sick flows, and sweet hooks. The rhymes are very creative. The highlights of this album be "Blue Bird" best track on the LP, "Bounce to this" gets your pumped for the album. "I Got my nine". "Niggaz on the jock" "M.N.O.H.P" "Pass the zig zags" and "Dedication" but all the tracks pound. This gem from RBL Posse is a must have for any west coast rap fan+music
GREAT BEGINNING SAD ENDING!+N+Lisa Lisa &amp; Cult Jam, guilty pleasure of the middle 80's scene, she was the queen of Freestyle by that time, her music was around every club, and her style will remain in many people minds.  Her sounds were extremely danceable, although some people thought that her voice was a little bit squirky and anoying, it fitted just great to the type of music she wanted to approach, even her hit ballad &quot;All Cried Out&quot; a bittersweet melody with amazing lyrics, that will be covered later by many, fitted her just great, but undoubtly her greatest achievment was dance music, &quot;Head To Toe&quot;, &quot;Lost In Emotion&quot;, where #1's the same year and make everybody love this, sadly she became lost in more pop oriented tunes with the next albums, saving only &quot;Let The Beat Hit Em&quot; that it's truly a comeback to the dance music scene, but too late, the magic was lost and we should point to &quot;Little Jackie Wants To Be A Star&quot; as guilty for throwing Lisa's career to oblivion, but if you forget that and concentrate on the early materials you will find an artist that surface out of the bunch, because they were talented and had a new flavor to offer to the public+music
Finally!+P+After the last few albums I was losing hope but DAMN this one rocks! Highlights are definitely Die Dead Enough, The Scorpion, Kick The Chair, Back In The Day, Of Mice and Men, and Tears In A Vial. The rest are mediocre but ho wmany albums do you buy anymore with so many great songs+music
Live Beautiful Day+N+Couple good renditions but pretty poor sonics and a number of forgettable tunes. Their studio album "It's a Beautiful Day" remains the one to own+music
LOVE TO HEAR YOU ALWAYS YOU ARE GREAT+P+I HOPE THAT FREDDIE IS WELL AND HOPE TO SEE YOU ALL SOON. WISHING YOU ALL THE BEST IN LIFE. LIFE IS WHAT YOU MAKE IT. YOU MAKE IT EASY LISTENING  HAPPY HOLIDAYS TO AL+music
McGee &quot;Slaughters&quot; Album+N+With Edward McGee's whiny vocal arrangements coupled with lyrics such as, &quot;I can't stand to see the slaughter, but still I eats the meat&quot;, this album's &quot;chops&quot; are nothing but mindless butchery. The  torture continues with sappy tracks like &quot;You Ought to be Having  Fun&quot; and &quot;Make Someone Happy&quot;. What would truly make me  happy is throwing this album into a bonfire and roasting it to a crisp,  golden brown. Eating this tainted &quot;meat&quot; will leave you with a  bad taste in your mouth. Bon Appetite +music
Experimental Joni+P+Sometimes I still can't believe the constant quality of Joni Mitchell's discography from the early days in 1968 up until 1980. Mitchell released several masterpieces, not only the well-known Blue and Court & Spark, but also the 'transitional' albums For The Roses annd Hissing Of Summer Lawns can be marked as totally perfect works of art as far as I'm concerned. From there on things got less accesible but actually even more interesting, as Mitchell plunged into the depths of jazz, classical and even African music on Don Juan's Reckless Daughter.   The album takes some time to get used to, but the end-result is a flawed yet fully satisfying album like Blue. Here Mitchell just went through the roof and shamelessly recorded an African drum-and-chant piece (The Tenth World), awkward minimalist-music (the gorgeous Dreamland) and a 16-minute song that packed folk, jazz and classical into one mindblowing piece called Paprika Plains. The other songs continue where Hejira ended, most notably the lovely Jericho and Talk To Me.   The endresult is simply a fantastic record, that many people had problems with upon the original time of release. Too experimental, too weird, too out-there. That may be, but fact is that Don Juan's Reckless Daughter stands as Joni Mitchell's most interesting and boldy innovative work. Ever.+music
not what it claimed to be+N+I purchased this as it said it was enhanced with music; it is not enhanced with music, just ocean surf sounds+music
A must have CD+P+This CD has a wonderful selection of songs. I was a little worried at first that they wouldn't be "original", but you will not be disappointed. I recommend this CD highly!!!+music
gag.+N+i despise this. there is absoluetly no point of listening to this, for you are missing out on ALL of jonathan larsons creation- and it isn't fair to the listener OR the creator. i woudln't waste my money on this. if anything, give it as a present, or as sort of an INTRODUCTION to RENT, but bits and pieces of the magic just is wrong. even if it claims to be "the best of rent"- i disagree, the BEST of rent is jonathan larsons creation in its entirety+music
don't try this at home+P+fans of too short shouild get this features erik sermon, goldy, mc bred, baby d spice 1, shock g, and other goodies definitely a must have plus for old heads shorty b does his tribute to maggot brain with the funkadelic inspired title track sho nuf funky+music
this album blows+N+the vocals are hella cool but the lyrics are g.ay, and i the layering could have been better.  I kinda like this band but i think  this album could have been alot more then it was. oh well what do i know, i am not doing what their doing, im siting on a computer crying about it, oh well whatever their lucky but i still hate this album, but its still semi ok but just not for me, it make me  yaw+music
My personal favorite Pixies release+P+It seems like when it comes to the Pixies, the talk is generally "Surfer Rosa this" and "Doolittle that," and while those are certainly good albums I've never figured out why Bossanova got so much less attention than its two predecessors.  With the exception of Trompe Le Monde (which I plan on getting around to eventually, I swear) I've heard pretty much the Pixies' whole output, and out of of everything this album keeps me coming back the most often.  Bossanova turns down the noise assaults from the Pixies' earlier career down just a bit, but in their place is a more arty, spacey effort that throws some heavy surf-rock influence into the band's already wide-ranging sound.  Sure, there may not be anything that completely matches the sheer visceral immediacy of Broken Face or Tame, but for track-by-track excellence and diversity Bossanova is difficult if not impossible to top.    After the blistering, hard-rocking instrumental opener Cecilia Ann sets the tone, Bossanova immediately commences careening all over the musical map in a way the legions of alternative imitators that emerged in the 90's wouldn't even dream of.  With Black Francis screaming his head off at full volume, the angry, assaultive Rock Music sounds like Debaser on steroids, but from there the album takes a turn into more diverse and overall compelling territory that sounds little like previous albums.  Songs constantly veer off in unpredictable directions, making Bossanova more of an acquired taste than its predecessors, but it's one more than worth acquiring.  This album represents the Pixies' peak as musicians (at least to that point); the rawer edges from Surfer Rosa and Doolittle had definitely been toned down, but those albums didn't contain anything quite like the complex, Talking Heads-like rhythms of Dig For Fire or the dense, proto-grunge sheets of guitar noise of Down to the Well.  The Pixies' legendary use of dynamics was also honed to perfection here: just check out the way the whiplash guitars kick in at the perfect time in the soaring, etheral Velouria, or the way Black Francis's eery vocals and Kim Deal's crawling bassline give way to the headbanging chorus of Is She Weird.    All Over the World is one of the strangest things the Pixies ever did, a sprawling epic (by Pixies standards, anyway) filled with spacey lyrics and searing lead guitar lines from Joey Santiago that seem to come out of nowhere.  And is that a falsetto Black Francis is doing with his voice?  Well, yeah, most of the time, but it works perfectly for the song's trippy, drug-like feel.  Even when they're plowing ahead at full speed, as on Allison and Hang Wire, the band's more tuneful, surf-rock direction is apparent, but it's even more evident on pleasant, literally pacific tracks like Ana and the closing Havalina.    My enduring favorite from this album, though, would have to be Happening.  It doesn't start off all that unusually for a Pixies song, with Black Francis screaming his bizarrely imagistic lyrics on top of some slashing guitars and atomic bass riffs, but over its running time it just gets progressively eerier and more demented, with lots of surfy breaks popping up in the mix, culminating in Black Francis's stream-of-consciousness, half-spoken-half-sung mantra as the song fades out.  It's a total classic, just like this album, and essential listening for those who want to hear alternative rock from back when the label meant something+music
Why did you this to us, Rick?  Why?+N+Oh my god... how can be possible that such a talented composer had to fall in such deep nonsense, remaking a whole bunch of old tunes to end up like something much worse than even Muzak?  This is the music you'll hear again and again at the supermarket, just sufficiently engineered to num the brain.  Kiss of Life is the only light of hope (and that's why this CD gets 1 star - otherwise should be zero, or even negative!) but that's only because I love Sade+music
Great Melodies !+P+Truly the best of Ennio Morricone's music: very exciting, diverse and colorful, this CD is a great value. If you like Morricone's music, you'll probably love Arye Geiman - a yet unknown, but young and promising composer, whose music is also very melodic.  [...+music
Anderson L+N+This outing from Steve Wilson and Aviv Geffen was a big disappointment to me. For one, there are no standout songs on this cd. Its all one big mish mosh. I figured that this would be at least as strong as the first Blackfield cd. The songwriting seems weak and slapped together. They are going to have do something spectacular if I buy another cd of theirs. Also the song "Where is my love" shouldn't have been redone. It should have been left off this cd+music
Extra Cheese+N+I bought this CD because this band is from my home town and I've heard good things about them.I hate to have to bash my own city but if these guys are the best Vegas has to offer I don't see much hope for our Rock Scene.This band is no different from most of the other bands you hear on the Nu-Rock stations.It  reminds me of 70's bubble gum pop.Sure some of the songs are catchy,but in a David Cassidy sort of way.The singer sounds like he should be working on the Vegas strip as a Cher Impersonator instead of attempting to sing in a rock band.The Drummer is Boring.His style is Rigid,and it lacks soul.The Guitar players riffs are Flat and uncreative. Every song is about a girlfriend,or breaking up with a girlfriend...Nothing special here.It's todays Glam rock, nothing more...Save your cash+music
Save Your Money+N+I am so dissapointed in this CD. I bought it because I have "Blow By Blow" and "Jeff Beck with the Jan Hammer Group" and I love those CDs. This crap sounds like somebody that heard those recordings, practiced for one week and tried to do an imitation of them. I don't like one cut on the entire CD. I only gave it one star because I couldn't find a way to give it less.+music
Just doesn't compare to first album+N+I wanted to like this album, but it simply doesn't compare to Leftism. Leftism was way ahead of it's time and is full of sounds that practially tickle your ears whereas Rhythm & Stealth is full of sounds that are ugly and not nearly as pleasant to listen to. This is my synopsis and apparently I'm not alone as this CD sells for much cheaper on the used market than Leftism.  My advice? Don't miss Leftism but skip Rhythym & Stealth+music
Electronic soul music+P+There are still those that claim that electronic music is soul-less.  Its made by people on computers who aren't necessarily musicians and don't play any real instruments, therefore they say it lacks the human element that other genres incorporate to move their audience.  Well for those of you still trapped in that mindset I invite you to check out "One".  Not only does this record defy that thought but it should enhance your opinion of the capabilites and potential of progressive electronic music.  I was not aware of Dierdre prior to this solo debut however her previous projects were I believe more world/ethno music in nature.  "One" is truly a blend of electronic, techno, world & soul and even flirts with the lighter side of drum and bass.  The vocals needless to say are nothing short of breathtaking.  Highlights are the opener "Waiting For Spring", "Close To Us" & my personal favorite "A Way To Love".  Also included and I believe the 1st emphasis track is an unrecognizable cover of The Moody Blues "Nights In White Satin".  This record is truly fantastic in every regard and a great reminder of how good electronic music can be+music
The Doors and DTS Audio+P+I became a DOORS fan way back when they released their first album. Forty years later most of their music still bends my ear.  This elaborate box set is worth seeking out, especially given the limited numbers available.  I read some reviews about the CD remixes that were disappointing.  Well, folks, they were wrong.  And if that's all you're looking for they are being released as single CDs in the very near future.  I wanted this for the DTS DVD AUDIO discs that bring this set to twelve discs. Nevermind the historic but boring videos tagged on.  The DTS surround sound  is nothing less than stunning.  From Strange Days through LA Woman, the recordings were obviously meant to be heard this way. The remixes only enhance my favorites.  And this begs my next plea: I have this set, I have Talking Heads Dual Disc BRICK, and Pet Sounds, and the Beatles LOVE, and Lyle Lovett's JOSHUA JUDGES RUTH, Richard Thompson, etc., all in 5.1 surround and/or DTS.   I would really enjoy the Beatles catalogue in DTS, as well as most of Joni Mitchell's catalogue. And Michael Jackson, Dwight Yoakam, Steely Dan, Tom Waits, and any other artist whose music is marked by originality AND impeccable recordings.  The success of PERCEPTION should be a positive indicator that there are tons of music whackos like me willing to shell out hard cash for items like this.  All you record companies that are so worried about pirating and downloading?  Not us! Give us what we want, (and these aren't downloadable)!  Win win! Sony dropped the ball bigtime with SACD, don't let us down like they did!+music
I lied, this is definately a 4 star album+N+Authors note: For some reason I rated this album a 2 out of 5 stars, although I thought I had rated a bit higher, and since I can't change that "star-rating" now, I will say this:  This album is good, borderline great at times, and shows at a lot of promise. It's hyper and rough around the edges, but a lot of fun. It contains a handful good songs, and few great ones, here are a few of the standouts:  "Bicycle, Bicycle, You Are My Bicycle", and "Adventure", are both good...Although I feel that "We Will Vacation, You Can Be My Parasol" is a better song, and had they played around with it a bit more in the studio, it could have "the single", but it's a great song either way.  The next portion I would like to direct to members BYOP:  Whatever muse you guys followed to come up with "October, First Account", keep following it, and if need be, hold it hostage at gunpoint. That song is "the single" of the entire album, and if you can recapture that same mojo a bit more on the next album, the skies the limit. +music
Britten Brilliance+P+Captivating from start to finish: EMI has programmed & remastered this bounty of Britten choral work superbly. The Choir of King's College,  Cambridge performs with stunning sensitivity, ethereal, heartbreaking & transcendent. A just classic dis+music
Celestial Divinity Hymns+P+If you love untainted hymns, you will be blessed by these lofty recorded selections performed by the London Philharmonic Choir and National Philharmonic Orchestra. Two discs compress over fifty hymns to be savored over and over. And no...these are not light and airy, please-every-ear compositions, but are the solid rock truths of the faith. You can even attune to the atoning blood of Christ harmoniously exalted.   My only displeasure was found in the absence of sing along lyrics. To decipher all the stanzas, owning a hymnbook is a must. It is important to obtain one while supplies still exist...I am not completely kidding. My husband and I were at a used book sale where a man was overjoyed to actually find a hymnbook. He wanted to learn the comprehensive praises that are cunningly being pushed out the back door of most churches.   +music
So here's where the Beach Boys went...+P+When I first heard a song from this album (Sliding Doors) I was driving on I-5, on my way to Pasadena. I pulled off and bought the CD. I give it half a star over the 4 rating, and it would it be worth 5 if the boys had axed &quot;Right Kind of Girl&quot;. There is something painful about the 'siamese cat' line. Probably I just don't get it. &quot;Your Big Night&quot; is Steely Dan adeptly finessed into the 90s. &quot;Star Behind&quot; may have been inspired by The Moody Blues or the Hale-Bopp cult troop, I dunno, but I like the pulsating yet dreamy arrangement. My fave track is &quot;All Dreamed Out&quot;. It is a Satin Doombox+music
This CD is off the Hook+P+If you like sick beats and clean flows, Mack and Ad Kapone come dope on this album. Also on this is Dre Dog who brings some more ill mannered rhymes. This cds old but its worth the money+music
Beautiful+P+Soulful, smooth, distinctive...Paul Taylor is one of my favs on the jazz scene. He didn't disappoint with Pleasure Seeker, it will forever be apart of my collection+music
wow !!!+P+i've got a few of the Colosseum cd's and i've never been terribly impressed with them...but this incarnation of the band is something else entirely. they take a much more rock approach and prog it out with fantastic results. the pace is driving and speeds along with purpose and supreme musicianship. every song is full of intricate time changes, killer solos, and great vocals. the second disc is a fine addition to the original. there's no sign of a filler cut...it's all outstanding stuff! a nice surprise, overall. i'm hooked+music
If you're going to own one hardcore record this would be it!!+P+This is one of the best collections of any band ever compiled! Comes with the classics by Keith and Gregg Ginn that put, black flag on the map!  You just can't go wrong with the quick yet catchy songs that just stay in your head all day long. Fix Me and Wasted are a quick blur and that's how punk songs should be. Not some sort of Opera rock that goes on for nine and a half minutes long... Six Pack was always a funny song to sing along.  "What are we gonna do!?! the t.v. is broken!!! OH NO we're gonna miss our favorite shows!!"  "my girlfriend asked me which i liked better i hope she doesn't leave me"  It's kinda of a two for one album when you listen to it because both vocalist brought their own style to the band.  Find out what the fuss is over this band and pick up a classic comp!+music
if you have even a passing interest in Ambient music....+P+For an artist that has helped shape the musical map since the 70's, and remained a sterling producer, and also has a album workrate to put most musicians to shame, it's truly surprising that Brian Eno, has so many absolutely essential albums to his name.  Here we concentrate on the period where he Created/Produced a series of defining 'Ambient' albums in the mid-late 70's, that although not the first to produce ambient albums, mastered the form to such a degree, that some 20-30 years on, these albums are frequently referenced, when discussing the genre.   Although as much an electronic album as it is an ambient album, the mood here is one of detached sounds, restrained instruments and a slightly Eerie, and atmospheric solitude.  using a system of two reel-to-reel tape recorders, and making the (relatively) simple process of layering sounds on top of one another, Eno was able to make stark simple sounds, from such instruments as...keyboard, synth, organ, but layer them in such a way that although the music rarely changes direction, it's beauty comes in the form of its simplicity.  The first track...the epic "Discreet Music" is really nothing more than a melancholic & slight sounding relaxation drone.  But its what Eno does with the sound and the use of spacial sound, that truly makes this impressive.   Brief compositions of synth are gradually brought in and out of the mix, and although most listeners won't realise it on the first listen, but the relation of these elements changes over time, albeit it very gradually, and coupled with the subtle use of noise and resonance, it reveals a sound of soothing 'ambience' that washes over the listener.  The "Three Variations on the Canon in D Major" is more consistent with the stylisation of 'Classical' music, with it less akin to 'Ambient' music, and more in keeping with the compositional elegance and arrangement of piano led orchestration.  which has a  rather melancholy and restless feel to it, and the tone of the strings/piano feels vastly different to the synth-led first track, and its arguably the more immediate track, due to its more noticeable increase in volume/tempo, and although a more rounded sound, still remains very delicate and gentle.  In fact imagine these beautifully crafted tracks as works for soundtracks  for films that were never filmed, as it's deeply beguiling and littered with the romanticism that became a trademark in Eno's series of 'Ambient' Albums.  As it's all so precisely performed and tremendously realised, that one can't help but fall in love with this incredible album.   If you picked up any of Eno's other 'Ambient' albums, I really can't stress enough, how utterly recommended this album comes, It's not only considered one of his finest 'Ambient' albums, but also just a truly exceptional album regardless of the genre.   Utterly Essentia+music
Another gem from Chumbawamba+P+The packaging of the DVD with the Readymades LP makes for a perfect match.  The original album was very strong, the DVD is very entertaining.  Recommended for the Chumbawamba fan+music
Wonderfully entertaining classic Celtic storytelling+P+This wonderful collection of stories is a favorite of mychildren. My children ask for this one again and again, but I enjoyhearing the masterfully told stories so much, I don't mind hearing it over and over myself+music
Kingston Trio+N+Listening to this cd took me back to my growing-up years.  I remembered all their songs I loved back then.  It's a great homecoming+music
2 1/2 stars-- ok, but a bit overproduced.+N+"Nonsuch" is one of those records that I think was doomed to failure-- having constructed (with a little help from Todd Rundgren) a thematic song cycle ("Skylarking") and an album of perhaps the best pop music in two decades ("Oranges & Lemons"), the bar was set pretty high for XTC, and in an attempt to reach it, they seemed to have overreached a bit.  It's not that the album is bad per se, it's just so carefully arranged and produced to have lost the edge that made its predecessors so great.  The band seems to have distilled themselves down to midtempo numbers, occasionally finding a bit of a driving electric sound (opener "The Ballad of Peter Pumpkinhead"), but largely sticking to a quieter, balladry style, often primarily piano driven.  Sometimes it works out quite nicely, the lovely, chirping staccato guitars on "Humble Daisy" provide ample support for a simply fantastic lead vocal by Andy Partridge, and certainly the lilting off-rhythm of "Then She Appeared" is downright captivating, but more likely than not, the pieces end up blending one into another as pretty much unmemorable pop songs that are inoffensive and ok but just not attention getting (Colin Moulding's "My Bird Performs", Partridge's "The Disappointed").  To cap things off, the album stretches over an hour long, and by the end of the record, even the more intriguing material ("The Ugly Underneath") seems to blend in with the rest.  It's tough though, becaue none of it is particularly bad, and in fact, all sorts of neat stuff is going on throughout-- great three part harmonies (Brian Wilson style with a falsetto over the top) catch the ear on "Dear Madam Barnum", "Wrapped in Grey" twists and turns every which way, "War Dance" features an intriguing clarinet opening that leads into a set of reeds providing support for Moulding's venomous lyrics... it goes on.  In fact, with such detailed arrangements, everything's guaranteed to be interesting in some regard, but what it lacks is that feeling of spontaneity and energy.  One nice thing is that at least with this reissue and its remastered sound, you can make out the subtleties of the record nicely.  Bottom line, there's a lot better by XTC-- "Nonsuch" is an ok record, but they've done a whole lot more+music
Sarge reigns in the royalty of Girl Rock+P+I've loved this CD ever since we got it at my college radio station... Sarge definitely knows how to rock! At the same time, the band shows good range so each song doesn't sound the same.  I especially love the lyrics,  which express a spectrum of raw emotion and real-life issues, from a girl's  revenge for getting gang-raped to thoughts on &quot;how far is too  far?&quot;.  The vocals are never overpowered by the music (which says a  lot because the music is definitely kickass)+music
THE OFFICAL AMAZON HIP-HOP REVIEWER+P+Hello there people looking into buying THUG LIFE VOLUME 1.  i would first like to start with a little information on THUG LIFE which was the name of a rap group which featured 2pac, big syke, mopreme and a few other's. if you are a 2pac fan you may of already heard of this album although this album is one of 2pacs most unrecornised albums and when 2pac founded the group in 1993 they where quite unknown to the public and it was only after 2pac was shoot when people noticed the album.   the THUG LIFE group may better today be known as the OUTLAWZ with big syke changing his name to MUSSILINI on the outlawz albums 2pac to MAKAVELI, MOPREME did not stay with the group when they changed there names to the OUTLAWZ which was a shame due to the fact MOPREME was one of the better rappers on the THUG LIFE album, he was also the son of the late MUTULU shakur which was 2pacs stepfather. mutulu is mentioned alot in 2pacs older albums due to the fact mutulu was there for tupac and tupac saw him as a father figure,  even though mutulu was placed on the FBI's MOST WANTED LIST after escaping from prison in the 80's tupac looked up to him.   the name THUG LIFE is a name 2pac called the group with the meaning : The Hate U Gave Little Infants F**k Every1 which spells out thug life if you use the first letter in every word.  the notoious B.I.G was also meant to join the group when they had first started but the record label desided against it and removed b.i.g  * THE ALBUM * This is a old classic album and fans of tupac would be expected to have this place near the top shelf of any cd rack, due to tupacs death the rise of price's to shakurs albums means they have shoot up quite a lot and you could be expected to pay from $15 and upwards per album but at the moment i think this album is going rather cheap.  if your a fan of ALL EYEZ ON ME and alot of tupacs latier stuff and style then this album may not be your best album to buy, tupac is often well know for his poetic rhyming and graphic lyrics but this album is more hardcore and talk's about diffrent topics in one song rather then the song telling a story of just one topic ie: tear drops and close caskets  there seems to be more of a darker side to this album and although the album is diffrent to shakurs newer stuff this album is still a brilliant album, ( i didn't leave this album to be the last one to buy till i finished my pac collection, i think it was the 3rd i bought )  there are some brilliant songs on this album, songs like HOW LONG WILL YOU MORN ME in memory for kado (R.I.P) Which also D.M.X. does a memorial for KADO at the end of WHERE THE HOOD AT vidoe  even if you buy the album for HOW LONG WILL THEY MORN ME it is still money well spent due to the song been such a classic with great lyrics and a brilliant choaros by NATE DOGG, there are other great song on there too with great basic background beats of the drums with a funky tune the come over the drums. plent of song reach out and touch you when listening to the lyrics and you will find your self listening to the album more and more once you own it, also the lyrics are easy to pick up on and means easier to sing along with (we all like a good sing along) i would recomend this album to first time buyer's and defo to old 2pac fans who havn't got it yet.    thank you for taking the time to read my review, i hoped it help you in your choice. please feel free to leave coments and to also look at my other reviews by clicking on "see all reviews" button next to my name+music
Great Album+P+This is a fine creation of the 80's, with many classic songs.  But we must not overlook the fact that the best song on here was not even released. It's name: &quot;The Working Hour.&quot; Check it out it is haunting+music
So Hot It's Cool+P+I noticed that all the reviews are pretty short, so I'll try and keep mine short, as well. I bought this album around seven or eight years ago when I was a bachelor and living in a 600 square foot backhouse. Because my personal dwelling space was so small, I wanted to create an illusion that my place was big, spacious and open and I did that not only through carefully choosing my furniture and accessories, but by creating  a "big atmosphere" through the music I chose to play when I had guests over.  Whenever I played this CD at dinner parties I threw, people literally stopped and noticed the music. I had a few people snicker and say that the music was silly and outdated, but for the most part, people really seemed to enjoy it and paid less attention to the obvious fact that everyone was crammed in my little place like sardines in a can.  What I'm suggesting is that this music has a lot of heart, a lot of soul, a lot of punch for the buck. If you find yourself listening to the same old music, you might just want to pick up this CD and expose yourself to something so cool, it's hot+music
Flat and Limp Voice+N+I Like About 3 or 4 songs on here. I hate to sound negative but what i do not like about this cd is that, Jo'Omeara sounds very pitchy in most of the songs...Her voice starts to sound flat and very monotone after 1 or 2 songs. She Does'nt have much range. She Just raises her voice. Her voice sounds shakey and unstable. especially on "Relentless" the very first track. I love the song,i really do but her voice sounds like any minute shes gonna break down and cry. I am not a great singer myself but,Jo Omeara needs some voice lessons. Her voice is very drab and boring. It's Nothing extra.   For some reason she sounded so much better with S Club 7...you know what,the songs on the album are great,if Kelly Clarkson or Jessica Simpson sang them. I listen to the songs and just imagine "what if..."...it gets me through the songs i like+music
The worst album ever+N+This album really sucks.  The only good song on it is the last song on the tape+music
This is a great CD!+P+I'd never thought I'd like Debbie Gibson, but I guess I was wrong.  Most of her songs on this CD are great, and I aboulutely love them.  I personally like "Out of the Blue", "Foolish Beat", "Only in my Dreams" and "Shake Your Love". They are all good songs.  She is very talented and mauture for her age. Although I wasn't a teen back then, I have heard of her.  If you like 80's music and are a Debbie fan, then this CD is for you. This CD gets me going whenever I listen to it. I like pop music and 80's music for that matter too. Hope this review is helpful to you. +music
unfortunate+N+I bought this album unheard because I was such a fan of Prince.  Bad move.  I agree with the last reviewer.  I tried to like it.  I really did.  But, there is nothing on here worth listening to, let alone dancing to.  The subject matter didn't bother me (he's certainly been controversial before), but I listened to the entire album straight through and couldn't tell where one song began and another ended.  Bored now.  Only buy this if you're a completist+music
THE BEST SONGS ARE THERE+P+Only die hard fans of GERSHWIN should buy the massive songbook ELLA AND NELSON RIDDLE made in 1959 ,because the great songs are all included here.Back in those days ,GERSHWIN was still considered the best AMERICAN composer, probably because he was the only one who tried the classical experience and succeeded ,and also because of the fact that he died young.Nowadays we know that RICHARD RODGERS and JOHNNY MERCER are the deserving legends of AMERICAN popular music.Having said that let me say that this collection is perfect,it's really the best.Personal favorites of mine are SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME and BUT NOT FOR ME.Even the guy from TEXAS should enjoy that one+music
Fully developed Canterbury sound+P+This excellent 1975 album shows Hatfield & the North adopting a full blown Canterbury rock sound - a nice mixture of quirky prog and jazz rock.  Although folks refer to a Canterbury style before 1975 (I include myself here too), the bands lumped under the Canterbury style pre-1975 were incredibly disparate and utilized a broad spectrum of musical styles.  The Henry Cow (experimental) - Caravan (pop prog) continuum comes to mind in fact.  It was not until the mid-1970s however, that a distinct Canterbury sound emerged (quirky, proggy, jazz rock) and this album is a superb example.  The core lineup includes a virtual who's who of Canterbury rock: Phil Miller (guitars); drummer Pip Pyle; Richard Sinclair (vocals, bass guitar); and Dave Stewart (Hammond organ, electric piano, tone generator.  The additional musicians are also among the Canterbury luminaries and include Jimmy Hastings (flute, soparano and tenor saxophone); Mont Campbell (French horn); Lindsay Cooper (oboe and bassoon); Tim Hodgkinson (clarinet), and finally the Northettes (Barbara Gaskin, Amanda Parsons, and Ann Rosenthal).  All of the musicians are absolutely top shelf and the individual performances are breathtaking.  The ensemble work is also very intricate and there are some fairly dexterous meter shifts.  I feel that Richard Sinclair's vocals (and bass playing) are both excellent and it is always a treat to hear him perform whether with Caravan, Hatfield & the North, or Camel.  The nine tracks on the album are arranged into two largish suites, including tracks 1-8 and the massive 20'13 Mumps suite.  As I mentioned, although progressive rock is the dominant style, there is a good bit of jazz rock.  In fact, there may be slightly more jazz rock than was found on the 1974 debut.  There is also the whimsical Canterburian sense of humor - I think this is also a distinctive feature of the Canterbury "thing".  Greater emphasis is placed on instrumental sections and lengthy "jams" are scattered across the album, where Dave and Phil really get a chance to shine.  The Northettes also add a very nice, dreamy touch to each piece, and the woodwind playing, (especially Jimmy's flute work), heighten this effect.  There are also brief experimental sections too - the last few minutes of Fitter Stoke has a Bath is a good example of this.  Overall, although I don't feel that Rotter's Club is much different than the debut, some folks might notice a bit of more of a jazz rock approach.    The bonus tracks include alternate takes of Big John Wayne Socks Psychology on the Jaw and Chaos at the Greasy Spoon, in addition to the extremely jazzy track Halfway between Heaven and Earth, the thunderous (it is unbelievably heavy) Oh, Len's Nature!, and the once again very jazz-rocky Lying and Gracing (it sounds live but there is no indication of where it was recorded).  These last three tracks are superb.  All in all, this is an excellent Hatfield & the North album and is highly recommended along with the 1973 debut+music
Very disappointing+N+It's sad to see a band with this much talent play a bunch of poppish songs that sound like rejects from singer/songwriters or the Dixie Chicks. You'd really never know this was an Irish band. I'll be trying to unload this CD ASAP+music
disappointing+N+Such a title should deserve better quality... Other CDs of Piazzolla are much better+music
Timeless and remarkable+P+When I first heard Hatfield and The North back in -73, the music made a distinct impression on me. I love the sound of this band, with the easily recognizeable sound of the Northettes, arrangements Rhodes el-piano, solos with the Lowery organ (***** to Dave Stewart), the sleepy voice of Richard Sinclair and overall atmosphere. Great work, still after all these years I keep this band as one of my favorites...+music
Mediocre+N+The songs are poor, the recording quality is worse. For some reason no one can duplicate the sacd multichannel quality in Dire Straits or Allison Krause+music
THE WORST OF  4 OF THEIR CD'S+N+I bought 4 of their cd's from amazon after hearing the song "bad days" in a batman movie. This cd is the worst of the 4 i bought. Not one good song. Totally lame. I'm not even going to stick someone else with it. I'm just going to throw it out+music
Too much fanfare+N+For me, the performance simply missed the mark. A capable choir should be able to stand forth and sing out without a surround of distracting instrumentation. Though the poor have already suffered enough, I promptly gave my copy of this CD to charity. For that I beg forgiveness+music
Good sound but poor selections+N+Technicaly this is an excellent performance, however the choice of selections is doleful and does not bring much Christmas cheer to the listener.  The earlier CD releases by Chanticlier were wonderful but this one misses the mark+music
An Outlaw Country Fan in New Orleans+P+The other reviewers said this was THE Coe record. I gotta say it is! If you want to hear saloon-singin', get this. You can almost taste the sour whiskey and smell the smoke while Dave Allen Coe hits his licks+music
Why No new songs?+N+I give this CD one star, not because it isn't good, but, because it is the same stuff they have already sold once. I am a big Blind Melon fan. I was fortunate to see them live 3 times and they were great, but, when you can download songs like Mother Earth, Whoa God, Tickled Pink, and Rebirth. I have to wonder why they would release an album that is all old stuff. The only people interested in this album would be melon fans. Evident by how poorly Nico did in sales, This is very disappointing, it seems they are broke and are trying to rip the true fans off. There is nothing new, so do yourself a favor and just bust out your old CD's and play them, don't buy this, unless you don't own the albums.  The surviving members should be ashamed of themselves+music
"What is this.....?"+N+O.K. When I heard that Dave was going to remaster/re-release the Megadeth back catalog I got real excited. I still believe that this album is a true masterpiece, but when I bought the 2004 remaster/remixed version I was MORTIFIED!!!! What was Dave thinking when he decided to remix it. All it needed was to be beefed up just a little, but he went to great extremes to ruin it. I know Megadeth fans were pretty pissed about this, but the one thing I did remember is that the first time I heard Countdown... when it was release in 1992 it gave me chills........period! I have regrets about buying all the remasters at once.......BIG MISTAKE!!! So in closing I went back and found the original versions of So Far...So Good...So What!, Rust in Peace, and of course Countdown to Extinction, and yes Capitol Punishment...The Megadeth Years. I'm glad that I was able to locate them+music
This is not the complete best of Fleetwood Mac!+N+To call this the Best of Fleetwood Mac is a little far-fetched--it does not include any of their hits and great songs from 1967-1974, forgetting the songwriting of Peter Green, Danny Kirwan, and Bob Welch..It is not a complete so called greatest hits without including the early era--the title should have read-Fleetwood Mac-the best of Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham.  I am not knocking this lineup and I love the songs but my favorite is Fleetwood Mac--the Blues--the Roots.  I suggest the Then Play On album to get a really good idea how Fleetwood Mac was before Stevie and Lindsay..  Also, do not forget Bob Welch and Mystery to Me album--another Gem!!!+music
This guy is good...+P+To even begin to describe the music on this CD is difficult...it's like trying to describe what God looks like. Not only is the music just incredible, but the two female singers have to be the best two voices on the planet. Luker's Salve Regina had me in tears at the end (and I am getting all misty eyed just thinking about it now). Scott's singing is just remarkable. If Angels sing they sound like these two women. For heaven's sake just buy the CD!!+music
Omglolz, he said "boobies."+N+What's wrong with BHG? Besides everything? Is it possible for them to write more than one good song in their pathetic lives? My sister burned this CD from a friend, most likely because she likes the Bad Touch song, and I'VE been the one having to hear it in the morning when she's getting ready for school. It's pathetic. I don't know how much I can stress the word "pathetic", but it's the only way to fully describe it. Out of 18 tracks, there's one, count it, ONE good song, "The Inevitable Return of The Great White Dope", because it's nothing like their other songs. Everything else on this album is just like "Fire Water Burn", "The Bad Touch", "Hell Yeah", you get the picture. Palm-muted, droning, songs with extremely explicit lyrics, which is the only reason people will remember them. Isn't it about time to come out of the 13-16 year old stage? Having lyrics about sex won't get you any. Bands like Blink-182, Sum 41, and System of a Down have funny songs, but they have their limits. About the "music": 1)Palm-muting doesn't make a song good. I get it. You can palm-mute. So can most people who play guitar or bass. 2)Make your music more diverse and varied, or at least change your patterns. Elastica's self-titled album has 4-chord patterns, except they play faster, and the songs aren't much longer than two and a half minutes long (not that I'm comparing BHG to Elastica). 3)Do what you do "best", and don't try metal. "Magna Cum Nada" is BHG's horrible attempt to make something metal-ish. Stop. The problem with Bloodhound Gang is that they just won't die. People like them somehow, and so they feel compelled to squeeze out more and more crap that gets worse and worse as it progresses, not saying that they were ever good.  Why don't we go through the songs and rate them, shall we?  1. I Hope You Die: See track 15 2. The Inevitable Return of The Great White Dope: Best song by BHG, but still not great. 3. Mama's Boy: See track 15 4. Three Point One Four: See track 15 5. Mope: See track 15 6. Yummy Down On This: See track 15  Catch my drift yet? I don't think I can fully show my displeasure with words. "1 star , because 0 is not an option" is exactly correct.  People, if you actually want Bloodhound Gang, copy it from someone. Maybe if they see their record sales go down, they'll actually think about quitting.  p.s. Track 15 is called "This is Stupid.+music
An eruption of a score+P+Alan Silvestri does great work when writing for action films and this really shows his unique talents. The main theme for the volcano itself is a 6 note low brass motif used frequently throughout. Parts of the score are similar to Eraser in instrumentation and orchestrations. One thing I was not too impressed with was the sound recording. It is a decent recording, but the overall sound is low and you have to crank up the volume to really hear it good. The best cue of them all is the thrilling "March of the Lava" which includes all of the main elements of the score, with strong low brass rhythms, pulsating brass trills, ostinato strings, and driving, militaristic snare drums. "Team Work" and "Build A Wall" are also enjoyable tracks with snare drums and heavy brass, especially those trombone shrill sounds that Elliot Goldenthal has been known to use. "Main Title" is a suspenseful track that does not use the volcano theme, but instead uses a light 4 note theme that you never hear again. Some romantic, dramatic music appears in the final track "Cleansing Rain" to bring the score to a close. Overall, a great action score that serves both the film and your CD player well+music
Nice collection from a great singer+P+Jimmie Rodgers had a wonderful, reedy tenor.  He was a first-rate singer.  The surprises here are the lesser known songs that are beauts, for example TLC Tender Love and Care, Child of Clay (which reminds me of Elvis's In the Ghetto), and especially the lush and soulful Wonderful You.  The last mentioned song is a real treat, absolutely delicious.  Three songs missing that I would like to have were his versions of Just a closer walk with thee, The Wreck of John B. and The World I used to know.  Hope someday Jimmie's A&amp;M releases will be out on CD too.  In the meantime, I recommend this collectio+music
Missing!+N+I'm a big Sytx fan and have most of their studio albums so this collection isn't of interest to me.  But the omissions of Don't Let it End, Why Me and Love at First Sight prompted me to give this a poor rating.  I guess Anthology doesn't technically mean best of or greatest hits, but I hate when collections are put together and charting singles are left out.  I would recommend getting Greatest Hits and Greatest Hits Part 2 if you're just looking for a Styx collection+music
One of Linda Ronstadt's best releases+P+I've been a Linda Ronstadt fan for years, and must say this cd pretty well covers her bigger hits.  It doesn't quite cover all my favourites, but there's only so many songs they can fit on one cd.  Cheers, Hazel+music
It is Very Different Then Anything Else from G.M. +N+I like listening to George Michael as I personally feel he has a great voice but this album is not really for me. I like almost all of his music but I could have skipped this one and it would not have been a loss+music
Sugar Ray and the downfall of what was once a good band+N+Well seeing all the reviews on here and being a former fan of sugar ray along with being bored to death at work I've decided to write my own review.  I believe sugar ray had something special with the first two albums as well but as time went by they have gradually gone from ultra-hip, I just wanna drink beer and cause trouble types, to oh so sappy songs about love and how heart break sucks, nothing that hasn't been told a thousand times over. When I first hearsd Sugar Ray back in 97 I thought their sound was revolutionary, I bought Floored and liked all the tracks and soon found myself buying the first album, then the third, fourth, and fifth albums came out, the third one was alright i bought it for the songs that weren't radio friendly such as Glory, Personal Space Invader, and Burning Dog; And with the release of their fourth album I bought it as well, hoping that they would get back on formula; Yes as you might of guessed i was delusional; their music had seemed to had gotten worse as predicted.....Now with the release of their fifth album, they had already lost me as a fan so therefore, I give all three of the most recent albums of theirs a 1/5 stars for lack of originality+music
Greg lets his finest come to your ears....+P+If you are familiar with Greg Brown, you probably are familiar with this release. If you don't have it, get it and treat yourself to an experience that take you on a journey of loves lost and loves to come. For those who are curious about Greg's work, this is an excellent place to start. There is not a bad cut here, and in particular, &quot;Dream Cafe&quot;, &quot;Spring Wind&quot; and &quot;Laughing River&quot; are a trio of songs that somehow work some sort of magic into allowing me to see into life a bit deeper for a period of time. Two other releases that go along well with this are &quot;Further In&quot; and &quot;The Poet Game.&quot+music
Great Christmas Cheer+P+Great old standards and some new stuff thrown in from jolly ole England.  Wonderful selection and performance.  Great addition to holiday collection+music
Give me the first two records instead...+N+Okay, some of this is awesome: the ballads Ain't Gone 'n' Give Up on Love and Life Without You are the best; Change It is a great blues-rocker, and his guitar livens up even weaker material like Say What! and Come On, pt. 3. Still, this is a thin album overall. Lookin' Out the Window; Look at Little Sister; You'll Be Mine and Empty Arms are among Stevie's worst. Stick to the first two records instead, plus maybe In Step.+music
Lisa Gerrard+P+Lisa Gerrard's music moves me in ways that no other singer/musician does. Being a DCD fan, I bought Mirror Pool & Duality the day they were released. (They are still my favories)  The Insider is a great movie. Some of the best work I have seen from Crowe & Pacino. Lisa captures the mood (much like she did with Gladiator) with her special unique voice & style.  Lisa's music has a powerful effect on me and makes me feel as if I am going through a re-birthing. The sadness & pain of letting go of the past coupled with the hope and anticipation of what is to come. The struggle & release cycles throughout her music but always leaves me feeling at peace. Meltdown at the end of this score fits perfectly. I love to meditate to Lisa's music and let her take me on a beautiful journey. Art at its finest+music
Rifkin going from strength to strenghth+P+i have to admit Rifkin's version of the B Minor Mass, although shocked me a bit at first, managed to convert me to the one-singer-per-part theory. the point is that in Bach's sacred music human voices are used as instruments & usually pit against the instruments. so the chorus includes both the vocalists and the instrumentalists. with this in mind, Rifkin's theory works out fantastically in his musical directorship. the sounds are crisp, the balance between the vocalists and the ensemble is perfect. I got this CD after being convinced by the Mass in B Minor. Highly recommended+music
Impressive and Affordable+P+The debate over the performance of J.S. Bach's cantatas boils down to the  following: the evidence suggests that Bach only had one singer per part for  performances of his cantatas. Thus, any historically accurate performance  of these works will maintain the one-singer-per-part approach. At the same  time, however, there is additional evidence that Bach wanted more  performers. We are thus stuck with deciding whether Bach wrote for the  musical forces he had on hand (which seems logical enough) or whether he  composed for the performers he would like to have (which would seem silly,  if he knew there would not be enough musicians to realize his intentions.  On the other hand, Bach does make &quot;solo&quot; and &quot;tutti&quot;  distinctions in the score... draw your own conclusions).  Rifken is a  strong supporter of the one-performer-per-part approach, which may seem a  little sparse at first. Yet, when one listens to the various cantatas on  these disks, one must confess that these sound, well, beautiful. This may  not be an approach which would work for all of Bach's works, but the  effectiveness on these disks certainly lends the interpretation validity.  Regardless of where you fall-- and if you fall-- in the strenuous debates  over historical performance, I would heartily recommend this disk. Not only  are the performances polished, but the works themselves are exquisite-- a  wonderful sampling of Bach's cantatas. (Personally I am addicted to the  duet, &quot;Wir eilen mit schwachen, doch emsigen Schritten&quot; from BWV  74 which I could gladly listen to over and over-- listen to it and you will  see why.+music
just ok+N+I think Beyonce has talent&is one of those Musical Acts with that Certain "IT",but at the same time her musical tendency's tend to be over the top. vocally she goes overboard&over things tend to  bring down her attempts at what she is trying to get to. this song is just part 2 of "Crazy in Love" which was a better track. this song sounds like it jacks Teena Marie's 'Square Biz". bringing back Jay Z is a waste of time because his rap on here makes no sense whatsoever. her vocal runs are nice& the channeling of Tina Turner is cool in places,but  more records like this show while Beyonce has a pressence along with charisma&is a Foxxy mama,but making  another so-so track is not a good look at a career that could&Should be something special in time+music
Don't be fooled by the names...+N+...Or the other reviews.  Those reviews probably came from someone in their camp.  When I first saw these two, I said "no they did not!"  If you go to a music  store it n the rap section and look through it, you will find knock-offs of known and real rappers.  These guys have their names for the simple reason of trying to confuse a would be buyer of Mobb Deep.  These two clowns are nothing more than sucker MC's trying to get a dollar off of someone else's hard earned names.  If you are new to hip-hop or just young, there IS a reason rappers used to talk about something called a sucker MC(a fake rapper, someone without skills, someone you hear and you know they should not be rapping) and these clowns are it+music
Auspicious Debut+P+This is a great debut album from a very talented Canadian artist named Amanda Marshall. She's had big success in Canada, but not so much in the US. I don't understand why that is, and if you listen to this CD I think you'll agree with me. There was 6 big singles from this album, and even the non single tracks are awesome. The closing track "Promises" is stunning and raw in emotion. "Let It Rain" was the first single and it's definately a powerful song that resonates with listeners, a song about searching for redemption. "Dark Horse" was also a big hit. "Birmingham" is a great song about a woman in an abusive relationship who finally leaves her man. "Fall From Grace" and "Beautiful Goodbye" were also singles and other favorites of mine. I highly recommend checking this CD out if you haven't already+music
poor recording+N+The orchestra was small and the instrumention poor.  Most of the pieces were short in comparison to the original movie scores, and tempos of some of the pieces were so different from the original movie scores that it made listening frustrating+music
Classical Gas+P+This is the most hilarious CD with a classical bent I have ever heard. Allen Sherman is gifted when it comes to imaginative uses of classical themes. Anyone who has heard any of these famous melodies will laugh themselves silly when they hear what is done to them! It's a super pick-me-up when I'm feeling blue. It's a must-hear for all you classical music buffs!+music
The Pick of the Bunch+P+Bowie's second instalment in the Berlin trilogy is a criminally underrated masterpiece, brimming with invention and vigour.  'Low' was most certainly an amazing achievement and an absolute treat to listen to, but unlike most, I feel that "Heroes" tops it in every regard.  The first side (like 'Low', containing the more conventional songs) has more urgency than the tracks on 'Low'. There is more energy and more depth to the song writing. Where 'Low' was fragments/ideas with magnificent textural framing, Heroes' first side shows really intricate song writing being beautifully combined with dense and innovative arrangements that take the clunky synth and electronic sounds of 'Low' and fuse them into a more sophisticated whole.  The lyrics are also much more intriguing. 'Low' was lyrically and vocally quite sparse, but on "Heroes", Bowie delivers some of his most compelling lyrics. Just couple of the fantastic snippets that pop up include:  'Your lips cut a smile on your face'  'There's slaughter in the air Protest on the wind Someone else inside me Someone could get skinned'  'Sons of the silent age... Don't walk, they just glide in and out of life They never die, they just go to sleep one day'  And of course we all know the gorgeous lyrics that the title track possesses. Not to mention Bowie's ultimate vocal performance on this track. In fact, the vocals on the "Heroes" album soar like on no other release of his. The songs climax and Bowie belts out some amazingly expressive and emotive performances. Overall, the first half of the record takes the best parts of `Low's' first half and 'Station to Station' and turns it into the most successful and engaging group of tracks that he has ever released.    The second half of the album sees Bowie reprising the ambient themes explored on 'Low' but once again this album outdoes its predecessor. The instrumental tracks on "Heroes" are even more evocative than those on 'Low'. Bowie and Eno once again strip away the clunky synth and electronic sounds and create more focused and more atmospheric pieces second time around.  Bowie feels like more of a presence on this album overall. Less detached, and not hiding away from himself as much. This is further displayed by the re-introduction of his sax playing on a number of tracks. He adds personality and flair to 'Sons of the Silent Age', provides one of many gorgeous melodic layers on 'V-2 Schneider' (which trumps both 'The Speed of Life' and 'A New Career In A New Town'), and his free-jazz styled, heavily treated playing on 'Neukoln' is oddly appealing. Bowie also plays the Japanese Koto on 'Moss Garden' giving a beautifully subtle and sensitive performance on what is a perfect ambient piece.  If you own 'Low', love it, and are wondering which album to get next... well I can't recommend "Heroes" highly enough. If you own 'Station to Station' and love it... ditto. If you have some of Bowie's other albums from some of his other periods and are curious about which of the more experimental albums to start with, this is the one. It's one of those albums that is experimental without compromising quality song writing. It takes the ideas first generated on 'Low' and expands and improves upon them, while introducing a highly unique and infinitely appealing aesthetic all of its own. It is also more timeless than 'Low'. It's sounds are still fresh and haven't dated a bit in the 30 years since its release.   It is not only the best of the Bowie and Eno collaborations (The Berlin Trilogy), it is also, in my opinion, the greatest achievement by this most amazing artist.+music
Disappointed+N+The A1A Album includes "God's Own Drunk" and this is not included on the CD with the same title.  How did this happen?  We main purpose we purchased the CD for this song and it's not here+music
On Par with XI, X-factor in Maidens mediocre second coming+N+Lets get 1 fact out: IRON MAIDEN DOESNT CARE ANYMORE!!!  How can they be SO brilliant with # of the beast, Piece of Mind & PowerSlave & then put out 5 terrible records in a row starting with X-factor?  This record is soooo boring! I bought it based on Wickerman which I found to be OK, reminiscent of  the old Iron Maiden & then they just ran completely out of material. Track 2 on sounds exactly the same, long boring slow tunes that never end.. going track after track, album after album. Does "Dream of Mirrors" ever end? I cant ever tell.. I just lose my attention due to its such a GD drag. Then they hit me with "Thin Line" which is even less interesting than the most boring professor I had in the most boring class in my entire college career.   You cant listen to the original "Iron Maiden" release & then seriously listen to this new crap & release it, unless you just dont care. Obviously they dont CARE!! This record is TERRIBLE!  If they did care they would relisten to the first 6 or so & rethink thier efforts & either improve the sound or just end Iron Maiden & come out with a new band named "Too old, too tired!" & quit defiling the great name of "IRON MAIDEN"+music
not fair!+P+how can anyone write so many great songs? c'mon people, plunk down the forty-five stinking bucks and experience the unearthly genius of robert pollard. if you are already a fan, there is no excuse to NOT have this. as one might expect, this is not the starters place to look. bee thousand, alien lanes or the safer(more NORMAL sounding) isolation drills would be the best choices.   nice packaging, good booklet. excellent liner notes. pick your favorite 20 or 25 songs and make the ultimate GbV disc. what a joy the suitcase is.+music
You got to be kidding right?+N+A Best of White Lion album? What are they selling blank CDs? Seriously, the 80's had great bands, but towards the end things were getting a little ridiculous. The final nail in the coffin for 80's rock was White Lion and Warrant. Nuff said+music
A load of C*ap+N+White Lion were just a rip off of Van Halen, except VH were better.  I can't believe some of these reviews, I have listened to this album intensely, the guitar player was copying Eddie VH not only on his tapping, but wangy bar and riff building.  The songs make you wanna heave, &quot;Little Fighter&quot;, &quot;when the Children Cry&quot; and &quot;Love don't come easy&quot;, this was just a sad attempt at trying to cash in with the glam rock chart material of the time, but they failed.  If this is the best of, then I'd hate to imagaine what the worst of sounds like, cause it must be diabolical+music
Going slightly mad....+N+Buy this disc if you want to feel like someone stole your favorite toy, tagged it with profane sharpie writing, and then tried to sell it back to you as something new;  Gavin's version of we are the champions made me feel like stabbing myself in the eye with my pen;   Eleven's version of stone cold crazy made me feel like i was having a seriously horrible acid trip;   and breaking benjamin's version of who wants to live forever sounded like i had the vocals slowed down but the music was sped up;   good rock song + crappy artists = cringe worthy remakes that never should have been released;  this album is only getting 1 star because i dont think it will let me give it 0 and Constantines version of bohemian rhapsody is awesome! it the only song worth listening and you can probably download it some where or get it from your dumb friend who bought the disc and then relized it what a piece of crap...  +music
What FLA should be+P+Only gay song here is Victim of a Criminal.  Everything else makes for a complete album with some real winners like Liquid Separation, Plasma Springs, Sex Offender, and This Faith.  In my opinion the essence of FLA lies in Gashed Senses & Crossfire, State of Mind and TNI, but Millennium is just a killer cd regardless of who put it out.  If you're new to FLA and this is the only one you have heard and you like the style then you might not like other FLA before this release.  I think they tried to evolve Millennium into later releases but failed.  Its one of those cd's so good it was probably an accident.  :+music
Millennium  ~ Front Line Assembly+P+When I first heard this album back in 1994, I did not like it all. I was expecting Tactical Neural Implant part two. However, later on in life and with a much broader palate for music I must say that I love it. It was a stroke of genius to add the layer of guitars and I love the hard edged sound which sounds like a mix between Ministry, FLA, Die Krupps and even Front 242. The cover is a very odd thing that does not look like anything at all and the text is not all that great. The lyrics are interesting and they make up for the not so great vocals with plenty of energy and a tremendous tallent to make cross over music. The guitar layer is amazing and add a brutal edge to an already grimm sound. FLA show on this album that they can mix and match their sound and still be able to create amazing music.+music
What was she thinking?!!!+N+Perhaps I'm just getting old, and maybe I just have such a special place in my heart for Dionne's recordings from earlier in her career, but this recording just doesn't cut it.  I understand the necessity and the desire to "update" old hits from one's singing career to make them "sing" to a new generation of listeners, but there is an annoying sameness to each song.  The electronic instruments dominate way too much, particularly the percussion.  Where's an acoustic piano?  Not one horn?  Not even a small string section?  This must have been a pretty low budget project.  If you are a Dionne Warwick fan or are eager to listen to her music for the first time, first go back to her recordings from the 60's.  Then try some of her music from the "Heartbreaker" and "Deja Vu" period.  But don't waste your money on this one.  I hope Dionne's next project has a bit more imagination and better instrumental arrangements. +music
INCREDIBLE!!+P+The guitar intro to RIPTIDE is worth the price of this CD alone.  Lou really shines on EGG CREAM, ADVENTURER, RIPTIDE, SET THE TWILIGHT REELING and FINISH LINE.  The only week song on this collection is HOOKY WOOKY.  I bought this CD in 2004 and I can't stop listening to it.....very groovy!+music
Doesn't get any better than this.+P+I am assuming if you are reading this, I don't really have to say anything technical about Mozart or these GREAT late string quartets. I am only writing this review to let you know... For anyone who is disappointed with the performance and sound quality of The Berg Quartet's EMI Mozart collection of these same quartets, this is a horse of a different color. Recorded in the early 90s for Teldec before the  Berg's signed with EMI, These performances are sublime.  You would not belive this is the same group that made those horrid EMI records. This is THE Bergs we all know and love and nobody before or since has made Mozart's string quartets sound this good. Perfect intonation, TONE, blend, dynamics and yes, PASSION. I've had many collections of these works and this leads the field. BY FAR. THIS ONE HAS IT ALL.... And the Teldec sound stage is the cleanest and crystal clear you'll ever hear. With wonderful front to back depth and air around every note. Demonstration sound with great imaging and transparency. You can "literally" step inside this recording. Well you know what I mean. It really doesn't get any better than this+music
Sorry Renee+N+I did not like this album one bit, or one song.  I had a hard time listening to it all the way through.  I certainly would never listen to it a second time.  Affected and pretentious.  Miss Fleming has a beautiful voice, but not here.  The songs that were not ugly to begin with, ended up that way.  So far I have "standard" albums from Kiri, Dawn, and now Renee, please ladies let's have no more of this, it doesn't work. +music
Sub-Par+P+This release is a great one.  However it does not compare with the original "Dear Diary, My Teenage Angst has a Bodycount"  It seem almost all of the tracks are filler tracks and the entire album must have been spit out at the last minute.  That being said the band From First To Last is still very talented both musicaly and lyricly. +music
?+N+What is this compilation have to do with anything?  These are a bunch of essential songs with a few remixes that are already on other CD's! GOLD?  Where in the hell is the platinum collection at?  I was hoping to fine more rare remixes from the artists listed on this CD, instead of nothing.  HIP-O records should be more focused than the efforts of this project.  What about the other Eric B & Rakim expanded projects (UNCUT, please,unlike the GOLD album they did for them...) Uptown Records Compilation re-release, Marley Marl's first jams on MCA... who's with me on this?  Even better, how about helping with BEP to stop selling out and making quality Hip Hop music again.  I suggest some real crate-diggers for the HIP-O staff in the future because this CD is a redicule of hip hop music, and they're not doing jackbone for r&b either!  I got one name for that: SWITCH's full-length albums on CD!  Hip-O and MCA/Geffen/Universal, if you're not going to at least make up you minds what name to use to lead the company, stop keeping the people waiting for quality products. I will not buy this so-called Hip Hop GOLD CD because it's junk! +music
Fun!+P+This is a very fun album.  Of course "Jukebox" makes you want to dance no matter where you are. But if you only listen to the singles you are doing yourself a disfavor.  Bent Fabric has really crafted an album and you will be rewarded for listening to it front to back.  The only reason this gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because the album is pretty short. Even with it being padded out with a few remixes (which are good and appreciated) this runs under 60 minutes. On the other hand its refreshing to just get the good stuff and not have to flip past padding tracks.  Don't get me wrong, this album is worth your money, especially if you are a fan of dance/DJ music. Very fun and a great party album you can throw on and leave play without worring about bad tracks ruining the vibe+music
Excellent Symphonic Christmas Album+P+I was looking for arrangements of many traditional Christmas carols done by orchestras.  This album hits the spot.  It is not uniquely orchestra carols, the Canadian Brass is mixed in as welll.  The highlight of the album for me is the back to back track of &quot;Sleigh Ride&quot; pieces.  It begins with W.A. Mozart's &quot;Sleigh Ride,&quot; followed by Leopold Mozart's piece of the same name, and then finnished with the ever popular arangement of &quot;Sleigh Ride&quot; by Anderson.  It is a really good mix of carols, and can be listened to for hours+music
Too bad the album isn't as strong as &quot;Fly&quot;+N+I first heard word of the track &quot;Fly&quot; in a review of Arf! Arf! Records' &quot;A Heavy Dose of Lite Psych&quot; compilation in Mojo magazine. The reviewer vowed that this track was worth the price of admission by itself, everything else was bonus. I was intrigued by the description of &quot;what Radiohead may have sounded like in the Summer of Love&quot;. Receiving the compilation CD, I immediately listened to this track and completely fell in love with it. When I heard the album had been re-released, I jumped at the chance to buy it. I have to admit I set myself up for disappointment. The only other tracks that come close to comparing are &quot;Land of Sensations and Delights&quot; (little more than two minutes), &quot;Christine&quot; and &quot;The Times&quot;. None of these tracks can match &quot;Fly&quot;, however, and many of the others sound like Jay forgot to write the rest of the song (like the last track on side 1, &quot;Nobody&quot;, if I remember correctly). It's still interesting, but I would not rate it as five stars. I'm hoping I'm not misled with Aerovons and Gandalf (both of which I'm getting ready to buy, and comparisons to the Beatles and the Zombies are enjolling me to buy these)+music
mostly, inspired power pop Christmas+P+There might be 2 clunkers on this disc but most of it is quite enjoyable.  For power-pop fans that might enjoy Christmas tunes.  Not necessarily for Christmas fans that might enjoy power-pop.  4.5 stars+music
MTV Unplugged 2 - Disappointing+N+MTV Unplugged 1 was a great album, that blended very well. Unplugged two just misses as a combination of songs+music
I Agree With Others+N+I agree with others This CD has been very badly put together. The sound is harsh. I thought there was something wrong with my Hi-Fi. It is such a shame as we've been waiting so long and Jon's music is so brilliant. I don't know if anyone else has noticed too but the title track fades out too quickly.+music
OFFICAL HIP-HOP AMAZON REVIEWER+N+Well iv read through a few reviews now, some good, some totaly wierd and none understanding, some dont know what they'v even on about but i read the review by G FUNKINN which i think is 3rd down. im a huge tupac fan and will defend his reputation if anyone dare try portray him as something other then a true hip-hop legend.  i was realy looking forward to writing this review about this great album as it's easly one of my best if not my best, but i was so shocked to see some write such a detailed review on this album (someone love's this album as much as me) G FUNKINN you'v done a brilliant job on reviewing this album and made me want to buy another copy incase anything happened to the one iv got.. .. ..   i'd just like to add what the story line of the best song on the album "tear drops and closed caskets"   the song is so well writen when listening to it your mind fallows the song and make you feel like your reading a book due to the way the songs writen, after its finished it makes you feel like after you have just watched a realy good film and you get that feeling inside that make you feel like what you'v just watch is actualy one of your own memories ( not mean that you have had happen to you what the songs lyrics are about but more that it's such a graphic song) the rhyming of the word is nearly unbelievable. you do tend to hear the same thing been rhymed alot in songs ie: im a G from CPT and other things that ryhme with G or E, but not in this song  the song start's by intruducing the 3 mean characters which are two friends called little moe and little trigga and a woman called little precious. it tells you how prcious is a getto girl and wont even bother with you unless you have a nice car and money, litle trigga's heart broken by the fact he's got no money and he want precious to be with him. so he meets up with his best friend little moe and plot to kill the two neibourgh hood deals and steal there drugs and money. they complete there mission and little trigga is seen as a big time man of the getto.  in the second vurse it goes on to tell you how precious and trigga are together and have a baby on the way but little known to trigga but his best friend lil moe has been seeing precious and it would apear that them two are togeher, after people see both precious and moe together start talking and trigga finds out.   3rd vurse goes on to say that now moe and trig are now enemys and precious is to doped up on drugs not to notice, the song ends with the lyrics. " small time dealing to selling keys, i cant believe the sh** there telling me, they opened fire 3 bodys dropped so call the cops, precious little moe and trig, tear drops and closed caskets".   the way the stories is told  is as if tupac and the outlaws are rapping to each other about the stories as if it happened and they had heard about it.      In the other views people have said that the outlawz have spoiled this album but i strongly disacree with these comment. the outlawz when i first heard this album i felt the same way and thought the outlawz maded this album not as good as it could of been but after a few years of owning the album you start too realise what the outlawz are saying, too the commen listener poeple do tend to get hook up in the beat and with tupac been on the album alot of people only start properly listening when pac starts speaking.      after owning the album for some time i started to notice the outlawz and although there lyrics can be spitted out in a fast and sometimes non-understandible style people dont actualy hear the words, if you do buy this album please dont just listen to pacs word but also listen to the outlawz because true listeners with a good ear for proper hiphop will notice the talent and lyricial skill of the outlawz and infact in a few song i find that they are very much on the same level as pac.  what more can i say. if you dont buy the album please down load the song tear dropz and close caskets  i actualy rate this 5 stars im not sure why it's only put a 1 star rating? ? ?  +music
Good or bad?  Your choice, really...+N+Being an avid enthusiast of the drum n' bass &quot;scene,&quot; as pretentious as it occasionally sometimes is, in listening to this Cd I feel this is not a strong representation of the genre. This could very well be  personal, (so you headz chill) but this type of jazzy, tech-step like, a  cappella jam seems occasionally cheesy and filled  with..well...&quot;filler.&quot;  I realize that during 1998 this was where  it was at for Grooverider. He was hardly setting off bombs in the d n b  fabric with other producers overshadowing his less-than-fresh efforts.   This album has a few choice cuts, and his production skills are  commendable, but combining so-called jazz harmonies with this type of genre  is definately an abuse of power.  The loungy progressions are worn thick,  and lacking any true creativity deep down.  This album comes nowhere near  stuff on the &quot;Prototype Years&quot; ep which was showcasing the fine  talents of heavy hitters Dillinja, Ed Rush, Fierce, Lemon D, Optical, and  Boymerang, to name a few.  It goes without saying that Grooverider has been  one of the most respected and talented DJ's, probably getting all of these  afforementioned producers their starts.  A big name gets alot of support   and can get away unscathed by negativity due to that stardom.  No one would  dare defy that Grooverider's attempt at making d n b is off key, but let's  not give in to someone's production skills because they are graciously  empowered in the scene like a king.  Purveyor's of fine drum n' bass can  find sanctuary elsewhere.  Stick with your records for the best+music
Beautiful voice, catchy songs.+P+Though I am not a fan of pop music, the beauty of Ofra Haza's voice lured me in.  This album has wonderful songs in an almost 80s-style pop music with "middle eastern" influence.  The lyrics are moving and deeper than typical pop music, complete with a voice that is unique to just about any genre+music
Get The Essential SRV instead+N+This doesn't include Rude Mood in either studio or live version, Travis Walk, Riviera Paradise, or any of his other unbelievable instrumental guitar workouts.  This compilation is a serious waste of money.  Virtually any album he put out would be better by itself than this compilation, especially Texas Flood or In Step.  Better yet by far, though, would be to get "The Essential Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble."  It's bargain priced, and contains every song you could want or expect, including the excellent, posthumously-released acoustic blues song, "Life By The Drop."  SRV is a guitarist worth discovering, but this compilation won't show you anything+music
Brilliant!+P+The interweaving of blues into Bach is incredible.  What is most gratifying is that Bach is very much present in this very smooth CD.  Highly recommend+music
Keith Sweat- Keep It Comin' (1991, Elektra)+P+Keith Sweat made this lesser-known, underrated album with some of R&amp;Bs most beautiful songs like &quot;Why Me, Baby?&quot;, &quot;I Wanna Love You Down&quot;, &quot;There You Go&quot;, &quot;Give Me What I Want&quot;, &quot;The 10 Commandments of Love&quot; &amp; even the &quot;Keep it Comin&quot; remix. The first side of this tape is filled with fast songs &amp; one love song. The fast songs are terrible. At the same time, this album is better than &quot;I'll Give All My Love To You&quot;. Keith didn't get as good as his first album until his fifth album+music
GREAT COMEDY HOUR.+P+This is a great comedy CD.  Sabes que I BARELY GOT IT.  I heard it was very funny, but it didn't interest me that much.  I finally bought it and thought it was very funny.  It is a must have from George Lopez's fans.  I can relate to many of the things he mentions, which makes everything even more hilarious. Recomended+music
20 GREATEST HITS PORTER WAGONER &amp; DOLLY PARTON+P+THIS IS TRADITIONAL COUNTRY MUSIC AT ITS VERY BEST. THERE ARE GREAT FEMALE/MALE DUOS TODAY, BUT PORTER AND DOLLY CAN REALLY PUT ALL THE EMOTION THAT THE SONGS ON THIS CD REQUIRE. WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND+music
A very pleasant surprise.....+P+I must admit that I have never been a Boyzone fan and quite fankly I found Ronan's solo efforts rather dull, so when a friend lent me a copy of Boyzone member Stephen Gately's debut solo CD I was rather skeptical. I was pleasantly surprised. This CD is filled with wonderful pop sounds and Stephen's sweet singing voice is used to full effect here. With several tracks cowritten by Stephen himself, the lyrics are basically dealing with his coming-out. A wonderful CD - I throughly recommend it+music
britney who???+N+When Britney Spear's first album came out called Oops! I Did It Again, I thought she had talent. But when My Perogative came out, I'm like, "Where she at? That's sooo NOT BRITNEY SPEARS!!" I couldn't believe it!! And her music videos from the CD, uggh!! I want da REAL Britney back!!!+music
Fertile Crop+P+After scoring their first number one album, The Heat Is On, The Isley Brothers' followed that classic up less than a year later with 1976's amazing Harvest For The World.  The band has always had something to say and never have they said more than on the amazing title track.  A call for understanding and unity, the song has more relevance today than it did twenty-five years ago.  The album is worth it for that song alone, but the rest of the album stands up as well with &quot;People Of Today&quot;, &quot;Let Me Down Easy&quot; and &quot;At Your Best (You Are Love)&quot; standing out.  The album peaked at number nine on the charts+music
Underappreciated and deserving reevaluation.+P+Queensryche was never a band to sit still-- from their early metal roots on their first couple releases, the band began blending elements of progressive rock and other influences into their sound until "Promised Land".  In many ways a pinnacle acheivement in the band's history, it would have been extremely difficult to equal.  The album was well constructed, an acheivement of arranging and sound, and while it was unpopular with a number of the band's fans (who would have preferred a straight metal sound), it was certainly a unique statement.  Many bands would have been tempted to try for a sequel in sound and feel, others would have tried to get even more over the top, still even more would be likely to retreat backwards, to rejoin the metal sounds of their youth.  Queensryche did something quite different.  "Hear in the Now Frontier" is a stripped done, bare record.  Gone are the swirling arrangements, the extra instruments, keyboards, synths, samples, layered vocal harmonies, etc.  Instead, straightforward riffing, blistering leads, and a looseness bleed forth, as though the band had been listening to what the other locals in Seattle were doing.  When I first heard the record, I hated it (even as a fan of the grunge movement that in many ways inspired it), but there was enough decent material to keep me coming back to it.  These days I love it.  In truth, I think it represents guitarist Chris DeGarmo's waning interest in metal-- he exited the band shortly after and ended up playing guitar with Jerry Cantrell for a while, and his stamp is all over this-- 12 of the 13 cuts on the record were written or cowritten by him, and the best material (that which looks back as little as possible) was soley from his voice.  From opener "Sign of the Times", with its sludgy rhythm guitars and wobbly lead, its clear this is something different.  The best material on the record tends to be the less heavy work-- from the laid back ballad "Some People Fly" to swirling love song "You" to the brilliant and soporific "Hero".  DeGarmo even takes the mic from vocalist Geoff Tate on great love song "All I Want", and while some of the heavier and more abstract material also works well ("Saved", the bizarre fan-favorite "sp00L"), its really an album that excels in the midtempo pieces.  The remaster is further augmented with b-side "Chasing Blue Sky" (a relatively uninteresting piece) and three recordings from the MTV unplugged show several years beforehand-- "Silent Lucidity" and "I Will Remember" get decent readings, but its really "The Killing Words" that is noteworthy-- its a fantastic and delicate performance of a great song.  It doesn't sound like old Queensryche, but that's what I love about the band.  They'd reach higher heights, but there's an awful lot of great material on here that deserves listening.  Careful and patient listening will yield rewards+music
Horrible+N+Pink Floyd is my favorite group of all time and a few hours ago I heard the Scissor Sisters do a cover of Comforably Numb on Saturday Night Live. It was the worst song I have ever heard. The Scissor Sistors are walking on ground they should'nt be walking on. The song was so bad that it took me a minute to figure out they were accually playing Comfortably Numb. I hope the Scissor Sisters are happy because they made a mockery of one of the greatest rock songs of all time+music
Two GREAT songs, four lame ones+N+I can't believe the 5 star reviews this album gets.  (Well, it probably deserves it more than Yoko Ono and Syd Barrett's albums, which also get mostly 5 stars.)  "Golden Years" is an excellent track, one of Bowie's best (wa-wa-wa)..  The title track is pretty catchy too.  But the rest of it is just depressing, dull songs with little of the originality that marked his Hunky Dory/ Ziggy / Aladdin Sane era.  He just ran out of ideas I guess.  I can believe he doesn't remember making this album - he sounds detached and bored with it all.  I've never considered David Bowie a GREAT vocalist, it's a testament to the quality of his Ziggy-era songs that you don't notice his vocals are a bit thin and weak, and need lots of echo and studio effects to thicken them up.  And the songs on this album are more vehicles for an accomplished vocalist than a simple singer-songwriter.  I'll give him credit for improving his voice and learning good singing techniques - the vocals here are certainly more accomplished than those on his earlier albums.  But it's not enough to save this lot of songs.  I guess it all depends on what matters more to you, the quality of the song itself, or the vocalist's ability.  If you like the first, get Ziggy Stardust.  If the latter matters more, get this album.+music
Is Hed Kandi Over?+N+If you were waiting for Ministry of Sound to ruin Hed Kandi well then here it is.  Thankfully I haven't brought this.  After hearing this compilation it is very clear that Hed Kandi is over.  The only CD that's any good is the 3rd one and that's cause it's full of Hed Kandi classic's which I've already herd a million times....  Don't waste your money.  If you've already brought any Ministry of Sound CD's this year then don't bother cause if you haven't grown sick of hearing the same tracks from the last year on radio then you will be after hearing this.  Reserve your listening time for something worth while.  Quality isn't a word I'd use to discribe this compilation at all..+music
Boring......+N+Stick with the 2002 and 2003 CD's. This one lacks the kick of the others and the chosen songs don't flow well+music
Oscar Lopez CD+P+I find the music of Oscar Lopez in this CD to meet all my expectations and I would highly recommend this purchase to those seeking the music of an accoustical latino guitarist  This was my first selection by Oscar Lopez, but I have no doubt it will not be my last.  He is very talented and his music is very rewarding+music
Inhale+P+Attempting to construct a solid soundtrack to a movie is also detrimental to the success of the movie as all contributing artists must put forth their best work.  Babyface has written and or co-written this entire LP which he has also produced with a touch of emotion from a woman's perspective.  As all of the work consists of heavy hitters there isn't any room for change as each individually could be singles in their own rights.  More so relationship driven from heartache this has everything you may be looking for in an all woman release including pop and R&B+music
A must for bluegrass lovers.+P+A must for lovers of bluegrass guitar and banjo pickin' by three of America's greatest musicians. Some classic stuff and, thankfully, some pieces I'd never heard.  Very high quality recording.  Unfortunately, there's only 11 cuts and I could listen for hours+music
loved it!+P+by far the best dieselboy cd yet.  the selection is really nice and the mixing is transparent.  if you like your music dark *and* jazzy, this is a perfect buy+music
Blue made me Blue+N+This album shows sadly that Nancy has lost her pipes, albeit ever so slowly. She misses as many as she hits. The arrangements are good and the surrounding cast is excellent with Bob Mintzer, James Moody , Tom Scott and many others and the artwork is superb! She looks great in the photos, and maybe that's good enough reason to buy it. But the singing is poor and her choice of numbers isn't so great either. I suspect that if she would keep it light and moving along at a faster swing-type tempo, as say Sinatra did at the end, she would sound better. Still a very classy lady though. +music
Everything that's wrong with rock music+N+I can't even begin to describe how much this band sucks.  Suffice it to say that you will probably enjoy this cd if you are a fan of talentless nu-metal bands like Staind and Taproot.  I bought this because I was trying to find a new band in the same vein as 90s crunch masters like Helmet and Quicksand, but I was severely disappointed.  This is a cd for people who like their music simplistic, plodding, one-dimensional, and repetitive.  Wonder what's next?--How about another song just as bad as the one that preceded it!  After the third song of lifeless droning, it just becomes annoying as the torment continues unabated.  I've listened to this cd several times in an attempt to understand what so many others like about it, but I've concluded that I won't be able to fully appreciate this band until I can learn to fall asleep and puke at the same time+music
Stilted+N+I suppose you will enjoy this if you really like Yo-Yo Ma at his most boring.  This is glorified elevator music and about as interesting+music
My Favorite Christmas Music+P+I have had this videocassette for years and its so worn I'm so glad to finally get a CD!  Jewel's voice is beautiful and some of the classics like Joy to the World and O Little Town of Bethlehem are the best versions I have ever heard.  I could have done without the non-traditional songs which don't quite fit into the holiday arrangement or match the beauty of her voice but its well worth the purchase for Gloria, O Holy Night and Ave Maria. If you like to sing along, I highly recommend it.+music
boring stuff+N+before you buy this poor cd you have to buy cathedral-&quot;forest of equilibrium&quot; and winter -&quot;into darkness&quot; which are what this band is trying to be .be wise .smoke a lot.know what good music is+music
Excellent!!+P+This is better than the album by far. All the mixes keep you craving their best song+music
Not Worth the Time or Money+N+Puddle of Mudd exploded into the contemporary pop/rock scene around 2000.  This album is representative of their entire catalogue.  For those music fans who want to hear true hard rock, pick up a good copy of any early Led Zeppelin or Black Sabbath.  For anyone wanting true grunge, pick up any copy of an Alice in Chains, Soundgarden, or Nirvana album.  Puddle of Mudd shamelessly (and inaccurately) self-promotes their band/sound as both hard-rock and grunge, while living up to neither.  Since most of their fans seem to be pretty young, they've been able to pull this sham off, mainly because their audience has never been exposed to any of the aforementioned bands...and honestly has no desire to listen to any older music.  The songs on this album are extremely redundant, with little variation of riffs or overall aesthetics from one track to the next.  The lyrics are horribly compiled to offer nothing more than a vocal rhythm and subpar content.  This album is a waste of both time and money for anyone interested in listening to any worthwhile rock+music
The world-class Hall of Fame supergroup of all time!+P+The Flamingos are my all-time favorite group ever. Extraordinary harmonies, impeccable timing, and intricate arrangements characterize every beautiful recording by this amazing world-class group. The Flamingos have a unique and timeless sound which has often been emulated but never duplicated, and most likely never will.  They have left an enduring legacy of music for millions of people to enjoy. May God bless them all+music
???+P+a good cd but if your looking for a god version of these songs you must! absolutly have to hear the studio versions on the other albums. but this is a must have for the hardcore fan+music
no go.+N+yeah....this cd bit.  i bought chillout sessions 4 last year, and looked forward to buying this compilation as well.  unfortunately, it didn't live up to the last one.  out of the 20 or so tracks on the first cd, i liked 2-3...and they were all on other compilations i already own.  the same was true for the second cd.  this was not worth the money.  i was very disappointed+music
Very different+N+To the person that mentioned Jim Steinman's lack of involvement with the album, I agree. Without the genius' magic touch, Meat loaf has come out with an awfully shabby album. The title song "Couldn't have said it betterr myself" offers a slight zing to the album. But when listening to the rest of the album, it is very disappointing. Steinman and Meat Loaf are the ultimate duo. But when one is taken away, it is noticeable. I would not reccommend this album+music
SORRY SONGS FROM SOMEONE WHO USED TO BE GOOD!!+N+If you want a greatest hits package from Reba McEntire, get her first or her second one.  This one contains mostly pop tripe from when she all but abandoned country music to "do what sells".  This collection is phony...just like the lady herself. +music
Mediocre+N+This sounds more like a &quot;country gospel quartet&quot; collection.  For a much better bluegrass collection, try Rounder's &quot;25 Years of Bluegrass.&quot;   Much better gospel bluegrass CD's are Ricky Skaggs' &quot;Soldier of the Cross&quot; and The Isaacs' &quot;Increase My Faith&quot; or &quot;Pieces of Our Past.&quot+music
horrible then and horrible now+N+this little white janet jackson wannabe is a total sellout and trailer trash with nasly moans for a voice and stiff dancing. And yet 70 million losers bought her records+music
Compositions superior to ALL other Anita Baker recordings+P+What can I say?  Rachelle Ferrell, Miki Howard, Deniece Williams, and Me'lissa Morgan are excellent, but this woman is the master!! None of Anita Baker's albums will disappointment, but this, I think, is the best she has to offer.  More than so on this album doe the music complement one of the beautiful voices God has ever blessed anyone with.  My favorites are More Than You Know, Fairy Tales, and Lonely+music
Beautiful debut+P+This is an excellent debut from Mindy. Her voice is beautiful and each song on here is good. &quot;Guys do it all the time&quot; is a fun slap in the face for all those &quot;macho&quot; types out there, the title song is my favourite though, but all are good, from the love songs to the fun songs. I hope she stays true to her roots though, and doesn't go the way of Leann Rimes and Faith Hill. One thing I have never understood though, is why nearly all country cds are limited to 10 tracks. This one for example is only 35 minutes long. Rock and pop cds quite often exceed 12 songs but country albums rarely even exceed 10. Anyway, thats just an observation, and doesn't take away from the worth of this album. Recommended+music
Not what I expected!!+N+I have been waiting for this cd for a while and I must say it was a complete disapointment for me.I am a devoted fan and I must say this production is not even close to the previous cd's.The songs are too bland and the quality of the compositions is very poor and flat.Overall a bad cd+music
Just as good+P+Most artists or groups suffer the notorious sophmore flop. (1st Lp off the hook, second not even close) However, I felt like they've improved off their first release. Beatwise this is one of the most head-noddin albums they've dropped. Production was flawless. Lyrics seem to have improved as well. Go cop this and support quality hip hop music. A++music
What is this?+N+This is a compilation of many different styles;  look Yo-Yo can play bluegrass!  Not really &quot;Classic&quot; Yo-Yo+music
SUNCOMM+N+THIS BAND HAS IS ASSOCIATED WITH SUNNCOMM.  Sunncomm protects the content on a cd so it cannot be copied.  DO NOT SUPPORT BANDS THAT SUPPORT UNLAWFUL SURVILLVEILLANCE+music
Don't Kid yourself into this purchase+N+I made fun of my best friend so badly when he bought it. Honestly, I gave it a chance. We opened it and listened to it for the first time together. But halfway through the worst remix ever crafted by man, it was clear, that I would be making fun of him for his poor purchasing decision, for months to come. This is the worst remix every created. It is long and drawn out and has no merit or quality to it. Don't fool yourself into buying something you will never listen to and will hide from your friends+music
Catch it if you can+P+It is not always wise to revisit old loves, because nostalgia can be treacherous.  But not this time.  As an adolescent in the 60s, I, like many of my peers, fell in love with Dusty Springfield.  Forty years later, I listened to this collection, and I am in love with her all over again, only more so.  Her voice was very special.  From the country-style folk of The Springfields, through the romantic standards, to soulful R&B, she could do it all, and all exquisitely.  There are nuances to her singing and a depth of emotion to her voice that I missed first time round.  Listen to the unique phrasing on The Son of a Preacher Man, a song that she made her own, and the delicious seductiveness of Breakfast in Bed (which I heard for the first time on this CD) and you will see what I mean.  Her life had tragedy in it.  In many ways, the sixties were not as permissive as you might think and the British tabloid press were vicious when they caught the rumor that Dusty was a lesbian.  This helped destroy her UK career and after that she spent most of her time in the US and the Netherlands.  By nature insecure, she could not come to terms with her relative loss of celebrity and resorted to drug and alcohol abuse and even a suicide attempt.  Just when she was making a comeback following her collaboration with The Pet Shop Boys and an appearance on the Jools Holland TV show (what a hero that man is; when are we going to have his show highlights on DVD?) she was diagnosed with breast cancer, which ultimately killed her.  Among the divas of twentieth century British popular music, she is supreme, and was one of the very few to achieve real success in the US also.  It was good to hear The Look of Love on the Catch Me If You Can soundtrack.  It will help keep her voice alive for a new generation.  That track is on this CD and is just one gem among many.  They repay close listening. +music
A band between trains+N+From the live disc, Astronomy Domine is the strongest selection but is marred by a poor original recording and thoughtless transfer to disc.  The bass track is almost nonexistent robbing this song of its thunder. The other three tracks are good, not great, performances of what are perhaps their first important post-Syd Barret compositions.  They are definitely not the band they used to be. The studio disc is a mess.  The first part of David Gilmour's suite is the best bit, some nice blues guitar.  Like disc one, disc two sounds muddy. My overall impression is that the band was in the process of just starting to grow out of their psychedelic jam band britches but hadn't yet figured out what to put on next. Live disc=3 stars; Studio disc=1 star; Net rating=2 stars+music
THIS IS MORE ABOUT THE AMAZON SELLER doolicity THAN THE CD! BEWARE OF THE SELLER doolicity+N+I enjoy the band Cracker and have no issues with their releases. I just wanted to make a note to potential buyers, if you are buying used DO NOT use the Amazon seller doolicity. I have ordered from them several times and EVERY SINGLE TIME they come in as THE SLOWEST of all sellers!!! I won't endorse who I think is good but I just left the 10th negative feedback for doolicity and hope I can save many frustration when buying CD's from artist+music
Compulsively listenable+P+I bought this Cd without ever having listened to a single note of the band's work.  I had read a review in Sound and Vision, then the views here at Amazon, and I took a chance.  I was not disappointed.  Every song here is an absolute gem.  The harmonies are magical, and the instrumentation will transport you.  I play this disk again and again, and I think my wife is going to hide the CD if I play it at dinnertime once more.  I promise you will not be disappointed.  Buy this disk, and simply enjoy; it's magic, gorgeous, and worth any price+music
Who cherishes the ladies?  I do+P+Clear, sweet voices are the main attraction of this CD, with well-chosen male guests to sing those songs best delivered in a masculine voice, like &quot;Bonny Blue-Eyed Nancy&quot; and &quot;Queen of Connemara.&quot;  The selections range from lively reels and jigs and the tongue-twisting (well, maybe not if you're Celtic) &quot;An Poc Ar Buile&quot; to the haunting &quot;Broom of the Cowdenknowes,&quot; &quot;Down by the Glenside,&quot; and my favorite, &quot;Erin Gra Mo Chroi.&quot;  This is another new-to-me group that I plan to collect more of+music
Omit One+N+There is no song worse to me than "Everybody Loves Somebody Sometime" and that one dud spoiled it for me.  I hate that song so much.    The others are okay, but this one dud - that is the one song I never want to hear nor would I ever inflict it on anybody.  It's heinous.+music
Dino Dino Dino!!!+P+I alway knew that Dean was a great camidian, but I wanted to find a collection of his greatest hits in song. I found it here on this disc. Dean had a great voice. No wonder the olive garden plays him so much in the background. I can even see why Regis Philbin plays him constantly in his office. This is a great disc to listen to. I did not grow up listening to this music, but over the last few years the music grew on m+music
Wonderful Undeniable Groove+P+I do not have many Kenny Loggins CD's. I bought the &quot;Essentials&quot; CD's and then found out about this one.  I am really enjoying this CD.  The songs &quot;fit&quot; into my playlists whether I am playing only Kenny Loggins music or playing other Artists as well.  It is always good when I can mesh the music with my mood.  So far I have been able to pull out this CD and find something that matched.  I would have liked a few more songs+music
forever standards+P+linda rondstat has shown us once again what real popular music is all about. the songs on this cd have great melodies, lyrics, & production value. thanks linda. we who appreciate the standards owe you a large debt of gratitude+music
Gotta Love Her!+P+If you are a true Alanis fan, the first rule is you must own everything she has done. Second is you must love everything she has done! This is a must for any collection to enjoy for years to come+music
A Well Fed Feast From Alanis+P+Audio Disc Breakdown:  1. FEAR OF BLISS - Some trippy rock from Alanis! This track doesn't follow Alanis' standard songwriting formula and is a bit scattered. Nonetheless, a great song. 4/5  2. BENT FOR YOU - Excellent alt/rock effort. This is the song that opens the DVD portion of "Feast On Scraps". Excellent. 5/5  3. SORRY TO MYSELF - This is a spine tingling ballad. Perhaps, dare I say, Alanis' best ballad. This song definitely should have been released as a single. 5/5  4. SISTER BLISTER - This one's a monster rocker! As well as the previous track, this would have been so successful as a single. Not since "You Oughta Know" has Alanis produced such a great rock track. Would have been a huge hit on the Modern Rock Charts. 5/5  5. OFFER - Another ballad here, however, this one falls incredibly short. While Alanis' voice is good, nothing seems to come together and the lyrics and music are to say the least, boring. 2/5  6. UNPRODIGAL DAUGHTER - Another great rock track. It's about Alanis leaving home for L.A. to start her new life. We see a hint of the "angry" Alanis we say on "Jagged Little Pill", maybe because this song is referring back to that time. 5/5  7. SIMPLE TOGETHER - I believe this song was the song sent to radio stations to promote "Feast On Scraps". It most definitely was a poor choice. While it is an ok ballad, it's somewhat dull. 3/5  8. PURGATORYING - This song is magical! It's a very enjoyable and definitely interesting song. There's almost an otherworldly feel to this. From watching this song being performed on the DVD of "Feast On Scraps", it's easy to see the magic of this track comes from the live performance. Nonetheless, great! 4/5  9. HANDS CLEAN(ACOUSTIC) - It's really nice to hear this 2002 hit stripped down to the core. Sounds great. 4/5  DVD Overview:  The full concert on this DVD follows Alanis though her 2002 "Toward Our Union Mended Tour" Most of the footage is from her Rotterdam show. It's loaded with hits, precious rarities and brand new tracks! Alanis has such raw, pure energy in her shows. Most notibly on tracks such as "Purgatorying", "You Oughta Know", "Flinch", "Sympathetic Character" and "Uninvited". This DVD shows us at times the rewarding and struggling process of songwriting in and out of the studio. Contains superb behind the scenes footage showing us Alanis' humorous and wacky side. It's also an excellent facet to understand her and her philosophy to a much greatest extent. 5/5  Overall:   I actually rate this album 4.2 out of 5 stars. "Feast On Scraps" is a great experience for any lover of live music! A great buy!+music
I'll take some more...+P+I believe this was one of their strongest and smoothest CD's they ever put out. Fourplay is one of Smooth Jazz's best supergroups. I have worn out this CD along with "Elixir", which is the next best one in my opinion. "Yes, Please" was the last CD before "Heartfelt". Although Heartfelt was good, it seemed like they are going in a different direction. I just previewed "Journey" and I have to say that i most likely won't be buying the CD, I'll just buy certain songs. If you want the definitive Fourplay collection, get every one of their CD's from the self titled debut to Yes, Please. You might even pick up "Heartfelt". If you want one of their best CD's, get "Yes, Please"!!+music
Extremely Beautiful Music+P+First of all, I am not a classical critic, and second of all, I have heard a lot of music in my time and this set takes the cake for the best of class. This music of Samuel Barber preformed by the New Choir of Oxford College exemplifies the title of this CD, Having not purchased the CD and just listening to the sample tracks available, I am sure I have not experienced it all. But, I urge you to buy this CD and to listen to it in it's fullest extent+music
fluid musicainship, great catchy tunes, a gem of a disc+P+Jeff Golub and his crew have got a relaxed and polished style- in the light jazz vein of say Bob James or the &quot;Crusaders&quot; They move from funky tunes, thru  soulful ballads and on to rousing infectious  uptempo grooves. This is really enjoyable instrumental work, familar but  never hackneyed. The musicianship is exemplary, tight and inspired  throughout. I'd put this disc in my top ten of the past three years- highly  reccomended+music
As bad as the warnings in other reviews+N+Mambo #5 caught my ear when listening to the car radio.  It is the only passable song on the CD.  I couldn't even listen all the way through the others.  Just awful.  I paid one cent plus shipping for it used and still feel ripped off by Mr. Bega.+music
Largely unessential remixes.+N+"Things Falling Apart" is the remix album that followed "The Fragile", and is remixes of material from that record.  After the high standard set by "Further Down the Spiral", I had lofty expectations, and that could be effecting my opinion of this one, I largely found that this album falls short of its predecessor in all ways.  It could be the choice of material-- largely sticking to the song forms, I think the remixers missed an opportunity to really place with something atmospheric and create something unique-- I mean, did we really need three versions of "Starf***ers, Inc"?  I find the original to be subpar, and remixing a weak song isn't going to produce a strong one, regardless of the efforts Sherwood, Oglivie, and Clouser put into their remixes.  Ditto for Hillibrandt's take on "The Wretched"-- its not one of the stronger pieces on the record.  And where's the remixes of "We're In This Together" or instrumentals like "Just Like You Imagined" or "Complication"?  This material has a depth and detail to it that suggest it could well receive a remix.  Now mind you, its not all bad on here, Reznor and Moulder's reconstruction, "The Great Collapse" (pulling in samples from at least a couple songs and layering them on top of a good beat) is very listenable, Benelli's remix of "The Frail" as a string piece may surpass the original in terms of delicate beauty, and the cover of Gary Numan's "Metal" is fantastic.  But overall, this is somewhat of a weak effort+music
Revs+P+This is an excellent CD!  I honestly can't listen to the CD enough.  I've had friends listen to the CD who aren't even interested in any sort of Celtic or instrumental music and they also raved over it.  McGoldrick needs to put out another one+music
Wonderfully balanced between Spring and Winter+P+This is an excellent CD with the wonderful music of Rampal's flute and Laskine's harp, a perfect and unique match. Whereas the CD contains many beautiful works, there are three that are sublime and deserve mention.   "Nambu Ushioi Uta" a Japanese folksong is a unique work as the sad willow melody is pierced by sharp flute interruptions, like an obstinate sparrow continually breaking the silence of melancholy. The piece tip-toes like an elegant silk veil floating on a branch over a night garden.  With its broken pacing, the melodies remain sad and reflective, but always interrupted by the pesty bird chirp, like a crocus on a dark mid-winter morning.  "Defune", a mature echoing ghosty melody builds a sad journey of experience and time. I would listen to this song over and over, allowing it to release any grief that I harbored. There is a lilting passage that builds and allows the harp to mirror or reflect the building lilting passage established by the flute. Then the piece moves toward a resolution of quite contemplation.  The CD ends with "Sakura Sakura" which Rampal and Laskine play for all it is worth, starting with a minimal slow paced introduction of the melody which is no sooner established than is rendered with a pastoral interpretation of the classic tune. And as the flute wavers like a songbird, a triump of music begins to build and anchors the central presentation of the work.  Now having established and adorned this rich tapestry, Rampal and Laskine begin pulling every golden and silver thread from this whole cloth to integrate minimal repetitions of the central melody finally offered to us in atonal windstorms and durges, retaining its uncanny beauty, made even more beautiful by the lack of perfection, the final sour note.   This CD is superb in that it balances the 3 tragic pieces I describe above with 8 other works of more gaity and light. I predict that this will be one of your favorite CDs for years to come+music
average but catchy+N+well lets be real here there are two really catchy songs and they stand out.Don't Let Me be the one &amp; of course one of the baddest and rarest Bass Jams from the 80's I Can't Wait.cuz the Synths took over at will and  sadly the music hasn't recovered+music
My top release of 2006+P+I cannot state more emphatically that Sunset Rubdowns album is my pick for album of the year, not just for how surprisingly good it is to anyone that enjoyed Wolf Parade's incredible debut but because it is simply inspiring from start to finish.  As a whole this is the most delightful kind of album, the one you wish everyone's side-band would put out to keep the enthusiasm going. The fact that it will remain under almost everyone's radar is not entirely bad, as it leaves it open for discovery many, many years down the road+music
Perfect record to own when you want to clear out the party+N+I have never been drunk enough to listen to this all the way through, but I have made everybody hit the door, even when there was liquor left, by putting on "Muskrat Love."  Perfect for the thrifty college guy that wants to keep a few beers for tomorrow, or has already hooked up for the evening and wants the dorm room to himself+music
Expensive for 32 minutes+P+To begin with, whatever else one might say about this album, it has to be acknowledged that the import price for this disc, considering that it is only 32 minutes long, makes it a somewhat overpriced EP.  Meanwhile, this somewhat forgotten quasi-gem from Alice sits comfortably between the New Wave / post-Hollywood production of "Flush the Fashion" and his most strongly novelty-influenced album, "Zipper Catches Skin".  Generally, there's a stripped down sensibility musically, and less purely goofy lyrics.  Partly, this is due to the opening "Who Do You Think We Are," which presents a rather oblique look, perhaps, at special forces.  The music is very stripped down--no, extremely stripped down compared to "Welcome to my Nightmare" or "Goes to Hell" or all of his later metal albums--it's as if Alice is getting in touch with his inner garage here.  Vocally, Alice provides his usual range of dark sneers, wide-eyed irony, and generally witty lyrics.  Certainly a promising start.  "Seven & Seven Is" (a cover) rattles along continuously with a snare drum, with jangly distortion guitars, occasional electronic flourishes, and Alice pretty much resorting to straight-up growly voice throughout. Hard though not to like an energetic song that declares, "Oom Beh Beh Oom Beh Beh yea."  "Prettiest Cop on the Block," as the name suggests is a transvestite policeman tale.  Definitely shot through with machismo, this is no limp-wristed rendition.  "I got a stiff reputation with a stick like a rock. My kids are confused, and my wife is in shock." The vocals are the growls as previously--the I've-been-drinking-and-smoking-too-much gravel kind of voice.  The music is a bit uninspired, particularly the drums. The novelty of the song wears out in fairly short order.  "Don't Talk Old to Me" manages to vary things musically, finally. A fairly deft combination of kind of heavy-handed guitar and lyrics set next to a chorus that features keyboards and a number of layered dialoguing vocal lines.  The lyrics, of course, have a certain cleverness as an adult obviously complains about being told to give up all his toys, such as guns and cars.  There are more musical details and variation in this song than the previous ones--the particular combination of comedy and seriousness here is pretty convincing.  "Generation Landslide `81" is a reprise of the lyrically excellent tune from "Billion Dollar Babies" (the tune, in fact, that gives us the phrase "billion dollar babies"). A military-march style snare kicks along, as simple guitar chords back up Alice's cultural rant, and adds a verse or two to the original.  One of the effects of this song is to point out some of the less inspired aspects of the rest of the disc, but that doesn't mean one isn't glad for it being here. Energetic, socially incisive Alice.  "You Want It, You Got It" let's out Alice's inner used car salesman, as he vocally sleazes his way through this either brilliant send up of the worst of New Wave music, or a rather unfortunate example of it. Cheesy keyboards and ham-fisted drum machine, many years later this song sounds so dated that it almost ceases to be dated.  If this song really tickles your fancy, then "Zipper Catches Skin" will be a treasure trove for you as this is definitely a prequel of that album to come.  Harmless cheese, one may not expect "cute" from Alice, but here you are.  "You Look Good in Rags" returns to a more traditional rock ensemble, guitar lead and all. This workaday rocker never really quite stands up, even with the semi-barbershop acapella section of "rags rag rags" toward the end, clipping scissors effect and all.  The non-stellarness of it does not mean that it's hopelessly boring. It's kind of good, harmless fun--it's just, one doesn't expect this sort of thing from Alice.  "You're a Movie" is a ridiculous cheeky monologue by a would be heroic general type. The music is thoroughly 80s, guitar tone and gacky keyboards all.  And, in fact, the chorus that chants, "You're a movie" is completely dead and unspirited. So what makes this pure novelty song ever-fresh, ever-delightful and really very funny are Alice's intercut remarks.  They say that in comedy timing is everything, and Alice shows that he's got it in spades here.  Technically a pretty awful song, one cannot help digging the wily wit Alice puts out.  The last track, "Vicious Rumours" provides that obligatory Alice song about public perception. The vocals here draw out the snideness more. One wishes (throughout the album) that the drums were set back more in the mix, and the guitars brought forward, but there's more energy in this particular rocker than most of the rest of the album.  So, overall one can hardly recommend this album without qualifications, especially if you are getting here by way of his first band, or by his later work, like "Brutal Planet".  As a kind of essay in cheese, and sheer low-fi production goofiness--and particularly of a sound that is glued immovably to the 80s--then you might enjoy this. Again, the import price is awfully steep for such a short disc.  A used copy seems a better way to go.+music
RIDING THE REGGAE RAILS+P+HOME & AWAY: Norrisman has been around for quite a while, basically since the mid-nineties - enough time to put out a couple of albums as well as several bucketloads of singles - but never really made waves away from Jamaican shores until last year's appropriately titled HOME & AWAY. Ray Stephens' easy listening FLAMES rhythm provided the backdrop for this passionate, pleading love song (as well as Richie Spice's super EARTH ALERT, and Morgan Heritage's lush IN A GHETTO), which met with respectable international success, and now heads up this latest long player from the UK's Greensleeves label. Greensleeves are obviously giving the artist a well-deserved push here, with glossy packaging and great liner photos featuring Norrisman trodding the train yards with a guitar strapped across his back like a Jamaican Woody Guthrie, or something. It's a classy package for sure, and without a doubt, it's a classy record too. The familiar title track leads off, and is matched and even bettered by great cuts like SEH DEM BAD, I'M A FREE MAN, the ganja lover's HERBS TO YOUR NERVE, and the bubbling ARMAGEDDON ON. The reliable Lutan Fyah (another recent Greensleeves mover with his excellent PHANTOM WAR album) shows up for the decent combination tune, AFTER ALL, but other than that, it's all Norrisman all the way, and to his credit, he carries it off without so much as a misstep. Most of the production credit goes to Byron Murray and his In The Streetz outfit, and the backup is bright and lively throughout, with a very tangible - and very welcome -  old school one-drop vibe. The only real detour is the Delly Ranks-produced MOVE HARD on the RED BULL & GUINNESS rhythm, which just shows that Norrisman is as comfortable up at the edge of the bump as he is with the roots and lovers material. HOME & AWAY is a very strong release, and along with PHANTOM WAR, one of the best rootswise long players of the year so far.   Next up on the roots release schedule is Mr. Perfect's debut, GIDDIMANI. Look out for this one - it could be another contender!+music
ALMOST CRIED+P+I WENT ON MY LUNCH BREAK TO THE LOCAL RADIO STORE AS I USUALLY DO TO PURCHASE MUSIC.  I HAD BEEN MEANING TO REPLACE MY OTHER SHIRLEY MURDOCK CD'S THAT UNGRATEFUL PEOPLE REFUSED TO RETURN, BUT WHEN I SAW THE GREATEST HITS CD, I SNATCHED IT QUICK, FAST, AND IN A HURRY!!!!  IT HAD EVERYTHING!!!!!  WHEN I HEARD "GO ON WITHOUT YOU, I WAS AT WORK, AND THE ONLY THING STOPPING ME FROM LETTING MY CO-WORKERS SAMPLE MY VOICE WAS THE FACT THAT I NEED MY MONEY!!!!!  MY EYES FILLED WITH TEARS BECAUSE MUSIC JUST DOESNT GET ANY BETTER THAN WHAT THAT SISTA DID TO ME AT THAT MOMENT!!!  I LOVE IT AND I CANT WAIT FOR THAT DRIVE HOME SO I CAN LET ALL OF HOUSTON HEAR IT.  IF YOU COLLECT OLD SCHOOL MUSIC---THIS ONE IS A MUST HAVE!!!!!!!  HOW BOUT' THAT!!!!!+music
Great Songs - marginal recording+N+It is tough to appreciate the spirit and enthusiasm that these tunes usually convey. Good song selection, but it sounds like this was recorded by a 30 piece high school band in their band room. I highly recommend going directly to your favorite college web site and purchasing their own arrangement and recording. No band can play any other school's song with the same emotion given to their own fight song+music
For the Already Faithful Only, All Others Beware!+N+Looking at the liner photos makes clear that Falkner is the prettiest thing this side of N Sync (and doesn't he know it, especially in the shot of him being served what appears to be a large dose of Johnnie Walker Black by a leggy Bunny Flight Attendant).  Which raises the question: is this the recond a boy band member would turn out if he got the idea he was an ARTIST?  Not to put too fine an edge on it, let's say bluntly that this is a vanity project by a middling talent.  Falkner does everything on the CD and my reaction is so what?  His voice is mediocre; his lyrics are banal (&quot;Life can be just like a painting full of wonderful strangeness&quot;) or precious (&quot;Suspended on this stage of grace I have to remember this sound&quot;); the layers of sound he tracks down are just that -- layers of sound, with a disspiriting sameness song after song.  Give him two stars simply because he CAN do all the stuff on the record, but this guy needs to become a whole lot less full of himself and to spend a year or two listening to, say, Chrissie Hynde and John Hiatt CDs.  We'll let him come back then and try to write and play some adult love songs+music
Dull+N+I thought the music was dull, the lyrics uninteresting. The only song that made me want to listen to twice was the Daisy Prince piece.  The Liza Minelli song was painful+music
I don't own this CD.+N+I bought this through Amazon for my older daughter when it first came out.  She tired of it after a year.  Currently, it is one of the dog's frisbee's+music
Mostly good material, but little value added.+N+"The Day the World Went Away" was the leadoff single from "The Fragile" and is of minimal value to all but collectors.  Two of the tracks on this are taken straight from "The Fragile" (with small adjustments, one's slightly shorter, one has some pointless crowd noise dubbed in), with the third (a remix) also being available on part two of the "We're In This Together" singles.  But looking at the songs themselves-- "The Day The World Went Away" is fantastic-- bleak, moody, with a great loud-soft interplay, a superb almost lacadaisical and very matter-of-fact vocal from Reznor, and a fantastic wordless vocal at the end.  The quiet mix is worthwhile, with a chant at the beginning and a delicate intro before moving the majority of the piece to a piano, in many ways it works better than the album mix, but its a bit overlong.  I'm thinking if the intro was trimmed it would work much better, the subtle reprise of the chant works nicely at the end of the piece.  "Starf***ers, Inc" is a rather popular song amongst fans, but I've always found it to be a bit dull-- the verses are nice enough, with a great beat, and there's some interesting guitar work on the piece, but the chorus is pure schlock and the lyrics are borderline embarassing.  Material aside, unless you're a completionist, you can skip this one+music
A disappointment+N+The SACD recording of Derek and the Domino's Layla is a disappointment to say the least.  I have recently begun listening to several SACD and DVD-Audio recordings and this sound mix offers nothing new to the previous recordings.  This is one of rock's best offerings and the sound on this SACD offers no improvement to the mix of Eric Clapton and Duane Allman's guitar work.  A major letdown.+music
Finaly a CD worth the $$+P+I won't leave a long review but I felt I had to write something in support of this album. As you all know, the millineum brought some pretty bad music with it. The 1990's brought the best music in my life time when alternative hit the scene. I was born in 65.  I don't understand how the junk most stations play even gets on the airwaves. In a world that's pumping out cr@p music. It's good to see an artist giving me hope that the industry isn't totaly going down the toilet. A quick rundown: -Best song is #8  -Excellent songs are 1,4,6,9,10,11,12,13 -Song #2 and #5 are still ok -Songs 3,5,7 are just average. Overall the album has excellent flow, ie. the hit songs aren't the first on the album.  -Rivals NIN's Downward Spiral. Without a doubt the best or second best NIN album.  I hope NIN will continue. We need to purchase albums like this to show Trent R. that we appreciate his work. PS. Keep a look out for the new TOOL CD out in a few days. I've heard it(don't ask) and it is their best ever! A must buy. -R+music
Not Original Artists+N+This CD does not have the original artists performing the songs, which is all that really needs to be said about this CD.  I normally would have listened to cuts from the CD, but I don't have a sound card at work and  made the mistake of ordering it without listening to it.  Still, you  shouldn't have to read between the lines in the description to find out if  a CD with popular songs are being sung the way you like to hear it+music
hmmmmmmm+N+peeps, if you want a good ministry album, try amazon.CO.UK!!  The club scene is MUCH bigger there and has the best DJ's in the world and so .co.uk has a much bigger choice of dance albums!  Check it out+music
Linda Ronstadt's first #1 album+P+YOU'RE NO GOOD,the #1 smash from this album is probably what made the album a #1 smash. There was only one other Top 20 hit,a cover of the Everly Brothers' WHEN WILL I BE LOVED. YNG came to the attention of Van Halen around 1978 and the band decided to cover the tune. The other songs are good. Linda Ronstadt's Asylum Records labelmate Andrew Gold plays guitar and sings background on YNG.+music
Loved this+P+I love this cd.  I watched the concert and was blown away.  There are very few things to complain about when listening to this cd.  I wish they had put the tracks on the cd in the order they appeared in the concert.  I also wish they could've done something with correcting the pitch on the Destiny's Child tracks.  It was painful to watch them doing it when the concert aired and it's worse listening to it while trying to drive. This cd is worth what you pay for it.  Where else could you get Billy Joel, Elton John, James Taylor, John Mellencamp, Paul McCartney and The Who on one cd+music
A Haunting And Invigorating  Album+P+Syd Barrett's first solo album is very different from his work with pink floyd.It is much more haunting and sad than the whimsical "The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn",yet it still contains psychedelic elements. The lyrics are poignant, meaningful,and haunting."Late Night" "Dark Globe"  "Long Gone" and "Terrapin" all have beutiful instrumentation and haunting lyrics.On "No Good Trying" and "No Mans Land",Barrett's madness comes through ,but in a way that adds an excellent tinge of psychedelica."Golden Hair" is a beutiful setting of a poem,while "Octopus" is a fun , invigorating, whimsical, and intriquing song.Not all is good though, it features the horrible songs "Feel" "If I'ts In You" and "She Took A Long Cold Look". They fall apart and they are out of tune.These hardly matter though,and this  is an excellent album with many things you woudn't expect from a crazy,drug addicted man+music
Uses for The Gift disc on Blueprint 2+N+The Curse disc is perfect, I will say that but The Gift can be used for the following things, other than listening purposes... 1. Frisby 2. Mirror 3. Toilet paper 4. Shooting target 5. Tras+music
Incredible Mix+P+Andy C is the best DNB Dj in the land, and this mix confirms it. This mix is insane. The best tracks on the cd are Bandwagon Blues and my all-time favorite track HOTNESS. Andy C mixes so smoothly and vividly. And for most of you who have yet to hear Andy C's next Drum and Bass Arena CD; you're in for a treat. It far surpasses Nightlife. So, if you loved Nightlife, you'll be blown away by his next Drum and Bass Arena mix...Keep Ya Heads Rocki+music
A Must-Have for Beatles Collectors+P+Of the three Beatles Anthology volumes, this first one is easily the most exciting for Beatles fans and collectors.  The idea here is to give a new spin to the old classics, and present alternate takes, working versions, live renditions, all of which are being released here for the first time.    This volume takes fans back to the very beginning, to 1958's "That'll Be The Day."  What a thrill.  Then we hear home demos that were recorded in Paul's garage.  This is followed by the material recorded in Hamburg with Tony Sheridan.  We are treated to five selections from the Beatles' Decca Audition.  Even if it wasn't the greatest tape the Beatles could've made, I'm sure Decca is stil kicking themselves now for not signing the Beatles!    It gets better and better as time goes by.  The Beatles sang "I'll Get You" at the London Palladium in 1963, and "All My Loving" on Ed Sullivan in 1964.  Both of those recordings are presented here.  Other highlights include:  *One After 909 - I actually prefer this version to the one that got released in 1970. *Eight Days a Week - the tight harmony at the beginning works well.  Also the false starts were interesting. *How Do You Do It - the unreleased single. *Free As A Bird - a new Beatles masterpiece.  Die-hard Beatles fans will not be disappointed with this set!+music
BUY this one, NOT the Madonna version+P+This is a great Broadway soundtrack.  Mandy Patinkin has an amazing voice, and the singing is amazing.  Don't bother with the pathetic movie version+music
Crescent and more+N+Crescent reminds me of how great a period of supreme artistry that Coltrane sustained during the last few years of his life.  I feel a need to inform all fellow lovers of this period of a little known album,currently out of print, called "Infinity" that truely ranks with his best. It was rescued from the vaults back in 1972 by Alice Coltrane who added a string arrangement which truely lends a mysterious quality and produces probably the most unique Coltrane recording of all time.  I first heard this album as a teenager and its mystic tones were a religious experence for me. There is something about the music that speaks of a man who knows he is near physical death and is searching for a path to eternal life.  Please note that I accidently gave "Cresent" a one star rating - I meant to give it five stars. +music
This has been reissued at a lower price+N+On April 26, 2005, this collection was re-released as part of the Universal Music Gold collection, at a much lower price (in Canada, anyway).  The material and mastering are fantastic, worthy of 5 stars, but the price, when compared to Gold, made me give the Anthology just one star+music
Blender = Bland+N+compared to their first 4 albums, this was a huge dissapointment, there are a few ok songs but overall it is very bland..+music
... BRUTAL PLANET ... seems too forced ...+N+"BRUTAL PLANET"  REVIEW:   In Alice Cooper's long and successful career (admittedly with ups and downs along the way), he has proved (to me at least) that he is one of the best lyricist in rock and roll history. Albums like "Love It To Death," "Killer," "Billion Dollar Babies," and "Welcome To My Nightmare" are just simply put - BRILLIANT. Alice was at the top of his game in the 70's. However, that is not to suggest that he's never released worthy material since then. In fact the quite opposite. Albums like his 1983 hidden gem "Dada," 1991's "Hey Stoopid" and the brilliant "The Last Temptation" (1994) is amongst some of Alice's best work.  However, in the summer of 2000, Alice unleashed BRUTAL PLANET, which was produced by Bob Marlette (Union - "The Blue Room") and executive produced by the great Bob Ezrin. While there are standout tracks like the title track, "Sanctuary," and "Take It Like A Woman" --- the album just falls flat. The new musical direction (Nu-Metal) seems too forced which is truly unfortunate because the album boasts some of the best lyrics Alice has ever written.   MUSICIANS:  Ryan Roxie ... Guitars Phil X ... Guitars China ... Guitars Bob Marlette ... Bass Eric Singer ... Drums  INTERESTING FACTS:  1. Released by Spitfire Records, "Brutal" Planet" peaked at #193 on the Billboard Top 200.  2. There was a Japanese/Australian bonus track called "Can't Sleep, Clowns Will Eat Me". That title was actually inspired by dialogue spoken in the hit animated show "The Simpsons".  3. The stage show - which can be seen on the "Brutally Live" DVD - is a post-apocalyptic landscape of wreckage that also features the Frankenstein machine, a Guillotine, two TV`s - and in some cases - three TV's showing weird video footage all through out the show.   PACKAGING:  The album cover - which was created by Kane Roberts' company PlanetFX - is a decent and once again, the booklet does feature  the album's lyrics.  APPROX. RUNNING TIME:  48 min. and 4 sec.  FINAL ANALYSIS:  Musically the album just plods along and is devoid of any real energy. Despite being lyrically well-written, "Brutal Planet" is certainly the most disappointing release from Alice since his 1989 album, "Trash". **1/2 out of 5.     +music
I love this cd+P+I love this cd. Whenever we started to watch Nashville Star 2, I saw Brad and heard him sing, and I have liked him since then. I bought his cd yesterday, and I love all the songs on there except one. But other than that, it's a good cd. I love the song I Miss Me, when I heard him on Nashville Star singing that while he was playing the piano, I loved that song. But to anyone that kind of likes country music with a little bit of rock or pop or whatever, you will like this.+music
A Memory+N+In the early 1970's Rolling Stone magazine did a piece on Roy Buchanan, the late, and great, guitarist. Roy once turned down an offer to play with the Stones. Ry Cooder was nearby, overheard the interview, and began a rant about the Stones and Mick Jagger in particular. Ry was quoted saying, as I recall, that, though Keith didn't attend the "Jamming With Edward" session, the tape was rolling. (If memory serves, Ry said that Keith left the session, supposedly, according to Ry, in order NOT to appear to be riff hunting.)   Ry said the Stones "stole" his sound and riffs. He said "Honky Tonk Woman" was an example of this "ripoff." In my opinion the signature guitar riff of this tune is definitely Ry's style.  Ry also was disdainful of Mick's so called "devil" persona. He thought it absurd that a twerp (my word but I think I'm accurately depicting Ry's attitude towards Mick) like Mick could be considered "satanic."  Later, when Ry's disgust became evident to Mick and he prepared to fly back to the states, Ry said Mick asked him what was wrong and did he want more money.   I think Ry wanted less BS from Mick and company. +music
hhmmm go for bonnie tyler i say+N+i must say kim has a good voice but to be honest the only songs i like are crazy in the night and dont fall in love with a dreamer. rest of music is very date+music
Melodic Death Metals Manum Opus+P+I really like all of Kalmahs previous releases, but they seemed to be lacking in some way; like they were on the cusp of something great but just couldnt push it over the edge. Well now they have. This is the best Melodic Death CD I have ever heard! They simply took the best elements out of every band out there and forged them into something amazing. The synth are a not so in your face version of Children of Bodom, The lead guitar harmonies are a beautiful mixture of Dark Tranquilites fast stacato riffing mixed with the violence and melody of old in Flames. The softer parts alude to my personal favorite 'Insomnium'. This has been the only cd i have been listening to for several weeks now just because there is no reason to listen to anything else. Kalman has perfected the genre! All hail.+music
Awesome!!!+P+Last month I went to drop my car at my mechanics and my radio was playing the Cover Girls-Greatest Hits. My mechanic said, "LADY YOU GOT CLASS!!! WHERE DID YOU GET THAT CD? MY WIFE ONLY LISTENS TO BRITNEY SPEARS". I love that CD so much! It takes me back when I was a teenager at New York going to Hearthrob's, The Tunnel, Emerald City, and the Paladium. Boy!Those were the great days! I also have the collection of the FREESTYLE-Megamix. Worth buying when you are a true freestyle freak, lol+music
this cd ...+N+I bought this cd because "Superstreet" rated it so well in their magazine.  The beats are continous and boring.  If he had any skillz he should have used them for more uptempo beats.  But everyone who rated this seemed to like it so at least he has some fans outthere.  My recommendation don't buy it unless you like slow boring not even close to melodic beats how one could even dance to this is an enigma to me.  In other words i'll never buy another cd with chris fortier's name on it ever again+music
Top Notch+P+Allele = Top Notch nu-metal/hard rock.   Easily one of the best rock records this year along side Breaking Benjamin and Flyleaf.   Worth 10 bucks. BUY!+music
Solid Gold+P+I admit, I rediscovered Spandau Ballet after hearing the song "Gold" over and over while playing Grand Theft Auto-Vice City in 2003.  So I bought this CD recently.  It's a very complete Spandau collection for the casual fans.  Die hard fans may find a missing song they think should be included but the major hits--"Gold," "True," "Communication," "Chant No. 1," are all here.  I'm not too much feeling the black and white cover, but the booklet and interior design make the set a very impressive "best of" collection+music
This is a great collection!+P+I looked for awhile to find a colllection that included almost all the songs I remembered from my younger days. This CD pretty well does that. I have heard a lot of imitators over the years, but no  one has come very  close to her great style and sound+music
Fine Second Volume of Obscure Apple Recordings!+P+This is the second volume of recordings of songs by writers signed to the Beatles Apple Music Publishing company. Though most of the artists contributing to the CD are pretty obscure with a very limited recorded material behind them, there are a few exceptions.   The Iveys, who later changed their name to Badfinger, are represented with four mod-inspired recordings quite unlike the material they originally released the group. Though all very much time-pieces quite interesting material, with Pete Ham's "Black and White Rainbows" as the strongest track.   George Alexander of Grapefruit wrote two songs for the CD; none of them recordings by Grapefruit, but both among the strongest recordings on the CD.   Songwriting team Gallagher and Lyle wrote four songs; three of them their own demos. Quite obvious that they were already at that time great songwriters. The Hollies sounding tracks "Technicolour Dream" and "Ivy Unrehearsed" are my favourites.   The obscure band "The U No Who" who later turned into "Bachdenkel", deliver some of the very best recordings to the CD. Quite amazing that Apple did not offer the band a contract. Their title-track "An Apple a Day" is a very catchy song; their music both melodic and complex. Their other two at least as strong.   All in all a fine collection of music from the 1968-69 psychedelic years in British pop-music.+music
Incredible+P+You can't deny the incredible horn riffs put forth by this album, they're simply amazing.  You'll get goosebumps listening to this album for the first time.  Although at times some of the songs can become tedious, it is still one of the best jazz albums out there+music
More Please!+P+Ideal for anyone who likes listening to the music of Micheal Bolton or who wishes to lay a trap for a Michael Bolton fan+music
Hank Snow Has Voice and Rhythm+P+Hank Snow is great on this CD.  He and his band found rhythm that will make you want to get up and dance with this CD.  This is a "Happy" CD+music
Randy in the Wintertime+P+I've been a Randy Newman fan "ever since there WUZ no Randy Newman," and so picture my delight when my very own kids bought me this boxed bonanza for Christmas (so I wouldn't have to). Randy Newman on the stereo on Christmas morning is about as Newmanesque a way to disturb the warmth of home and hearth as you can imagine. At one time or another I've owned every Newman album ever recorded, so I needed this collection like another hole in the head, but I have to recommend it as much for the surprisingly revealing biographical data as for the song selections. There are surprises here for even an old Newman trivialist like myself, and it was a relief to read of Randy's hardships as well as successes, since the dark side of this dark soul has too often been danced around in past articles and interviews. We learn that Randy's father, Irving Newman, MD, was an overbearing and cantankerous coot not above slugging it out with perfect strangers on public highways. We learn that the distracting eye condition Randy was born with, and the failed surgical attempt to correct it, may have helped to mold not only Newman's unique world view, but his discomfort with public attention. Interviewers (myself included) have generally conceded that "Randy Newman just can't look you in the eye," but then, why should he when he has such a gift for cutting straight to the heart with his nostalgic sentiments and shark-attack wit. Of the many selections in this package, my standouts are his 1962 demo Golden Gridiron Boy, a delight to hear at long last since throughout Newman's career it has appeared as nothing more than a musical history anecdote. Turns out it is a quite competent version of that idiotic pop sub-genre of the '50s and early '60s when unrequited love burned teenybopping hearts alive to the accompanyment of snickering female vocal backups. Then comes Jesus in the Summertime, the highly unlikely mock spirtual that has the distinction of having been so offensive to so many ears that a session musician actually walked out of the studio rather than play on it. Now THAT's chutzpah! Personally, I like it, and find nothing offensive about it, other than the fact that it has the name Jesus in the title. Finally, there's Laugh and Be Happy, an unfortunately incomplete demo that features Newman at his Tin-Pan-Alley best, with a catchy ragtime riff and a delightfully mocking lyric. This number is for my money one of the best tracks ever laid down by one of our most consistently rewarding, if challenging, singer-songwriters. Thanks for the memories, Randy!+music
The void is gone!+P+It is so refreshing to have Glen back (and better than ever.) I am addicted to this CD.  "Cleareyed" and "Finally Fading" are in contastant rotation on my iTunes.  If you liked Toad the Wet Sprocket at all, you will not be disappointed+music
Endgame+P+Two months before Billy Higgins' death, the drummer &amp; Charles Lloyd say their musical farewells with the tapes rolling (courtesy Lloyd's partner Dorothy Darr, who also made a film of proceedings).  They play sax/drums duets (Lloyd mostly on alto, in fitting homage to Ornette Coleman, though he also plays excellent Traneish tenor on three tracks); they perform exotic woodwind/percussion duets, with Lloyd on Tibetan oboe or flute; Higgins plays guimbri (the 3-stringed instrument used in Gnawa music), sings gently (&amp; rather dodgily) in a variety of languages, even plays a blues on the guitar or does a 1960sish paean to love called &quot;Take a Chance&quot;; Lloyd adds short meditations at the piano.  Some of these tracks don't mean much outside the context of this session--the piano solos get a bit too samey, &amp; there's too much voice'n'guitar (though the blues is rather nice).  Others are superb--the two long alto/drums duos (one on each disc) are great stuff, &amp; Lloyd's tenor pieces are also superb (there's a nice Traneish blues on disc 2).  The more exotic pieces are often quite ravishing.  I suppose that many listeners will for sentimental reasons like having all this stuff, the unalloyed good tracks as well as those that only acquire real significance in the face of Higgins' own personal tragedy.  I'm less sentimental when it comes to what goes on my stereo: I could have wished for a carefully selected single CD of the highlights, which would have been a genuinely outstanding disc.  Four stars as a compromise rating seems about right.  This isn't a disc for the casual listener, but for those willing to bear with a few qualitative dips &amp; peaks, it'll prove a rewarding release+music
One of the best jazz recordings of recent times+P+Dave Douglas's music is touched by genius. He seems always to be ploughing his own furrow, playing the music he wants to play and with partners of his choice. His impeccable taste and unique compostional style come from a deep  understanding of jazz and contemporary music. This recording is probably my  pick, but all come highly recommended. His sidemen know how to listen, the  empathy is astonishing, it really is a joy to hear. I look forward to  catching him on tour in England this Spring+music
timeless+P+the word &quot;classic&quot;,in my opinion ,has been way over used in describing noted records.but if there ever was one,this is it!Janis' best and one of rock n'rolls best.the right songs,the right band and janis.timeless.full tilt boogie really took these songs where the (pretty lousy) big brother never could have.if janis had lived,the sky would've been the limit.her heart and soul in every song.a truly great work.+music
Don't be turned away by the title+P+One of my favorite albums (and all-time favorite album titles).  Enjoyable even if you are not a fan of country and western music.  Ray Charles performs these songs with his own unique style and sound (IMHO - most, if not all, of Ray's performances are superior to the originals)+music
An essential component of a good old-time collection.+P+Gid Tanner is a legendary old-time fiddler, so much so that old-time fans are frequently seen wearing t-shirts that say "Gid is My Co-Pilot".  The old-time style here is, to discerning ears, quite different than the more common "Round Peak" style, made most famous by fiddler Tommy Jarrell, and quite obviously different than, say, Ozark fiddling.  None of the styles are any better or worse, just different, and serious old-time fans will enjoy picking apart the nuances of styles.  More casual old-time fans will enjoy this record as well, though, for both the excellent repertoire and top-notch musicianship.  If you think O Brother Where Art Thou is the real deal, I suggest picking this up and having a listen+music
As Good As It Comes+P+This very fine cd - from County Records of Virginia - is superb! County have once again produced a well balanced selection from the archives and have presented it to the public for their delectation. I would recommend this item to all lovers of traditional American Country Music. Don't let it pass you by+music
One of Zoot's best.+P+Zoot Sims never made a bad album, but he did make a great number that were merely very good. This one, however, is excellent. Sims, Peterson, and Pass all solo beautifully, and the bass and drum team of Mraz and Tate are  behind them every step of the way. The two standout tracks are 'I Got  Rhythm', where Sims follows an explosive Peterson solo with full-throated  honks and excursions into his beautiful upper register; and 'Embraceable  You', when Zoot proves that only Webster, Getz, and Hawkins can challenge  him for beauty of tone. That said, there isn't a bad track on this CD, and  it will give any Zoot fan -- any jazz fan -- a great deal of pleasure+music
Love her voice and style+P+I love the way she sings and the gift of her voice touches me deep within my soul. She speaks my language+music
Great Music, Terrible Sound+N+I wish that the sound on the CD was anywhere close to "Flowers of Evil", if it had been I would have given it 5 stars.  The music is really great live Mountain - maybe the best I've heard, but the sound is terrible+music
HIM Review+P+I was rather dissapointed by the awful review's of this CD. I love the band and consider all of there CD's to be the best one's in my collection. Ville Valo's lyrics just pull you into a different reality. The bands songs mixed with the Chris Isaak and Blue Oyster Cult's covers of Wicked Game and Don't Fear (The Reaper) make the CD better than imaginable. I don't care what the other reviews say I would consider this one of my favorite CD's.+music
Italian Music made in Canada?+N+Italian music from St. Laurent, Quebec Canada? I guess that is what one would expect. Sounds like a bunch of French-Canadian college students trying to audition in a faux-Italian bar. It is pretty bad. I don't know how they get "Gloria" as an Italian favorite. If you want Italian cafe music, don't buy this one. A waste of mone+music
Depressing+N+I love trance music, that style of dance music with fast, continuous beats and rich electronic sounds, and often sweet sounding vocals, usually female vocals.  So I thought I'd like this album.  Well, I do like it musically.  It's not great, but it's good trance music.  But the lyrics ruin the album for me.  Most of the songs exude a bitterness toward love relationships or a cynicism that love will never work out.  Here are lyrical samples from the CD:  "Maybe you're better off without me." "I'm wide awake, it's time to make it on my own; the dream is over." "We wanted love to last forever, but something's missing...I can't find words to break your fall, when 'Goodbye' says it all." "It gets lonely, but I have no other choice...no one sees my dreams falling all apart...I've been blinded by your lies.  I never knew love could be so wrong." "Tell me why you can't feel the things I do...I made the same mistakes I know I'll make again...It meant nothing to you, you'll never understand, it meant nothing to you, the touch of my hand." "November's here again, raining down on me, I disappear again..." "It seems like every [scrub?] I see is trying to get it on with me, they think it impresses me, the way they act so foolishly...I don't care, I never liked you anyway...You're a total waste of time."  If these lyrics fit your life, and you like trance music, you'll probably like this album.     I do like the remake of A-Ha's "The Sun Always Shines On TV."  It's not better than A-Ha's 8-minute remix version, but it's nice to hear an old favorite with a new flavor.  This album has three mixes of the song, none of them significantly different from the other.  I also like the instrumental track, "Blown Away." These tracks are enjoyable, and a couple others have pretty nice lyrics, but the album as a whole I find too depressing+music
nostalgic+P+i've always loved Pete Tong and his essential mixes.  then came this movie about the days long gone.  movie was awesome and so is this album.  every song has it's value.  day and night+music
Disk Won't Play In Car!+N+I bought this CD, and it won't play in my car because of the copy protection.   So I returned it.  WaYn+music
this is the best of hardcore punk+P+this is the best real punk band. they are hardcore.  ilove them and they can be compared with the casualties and the exploite+music
Great Music! CD doesn't work in many players+N+These songs take me back and are all top hits! It should be noted that the CD will not play in some players. Some copy protected thing I guess. It would be nice if Amazon would list the players that don't work with these CDs so we could make a better buying decision. 2 stars for the player problems. 5 stars fot the music+music
Judy Garland in Hollywood+N+I'm a big Judy Garland fan, but found this CD lacking.  Her voice didn't have that extra force she always puts into her songs.  Some of them sounded like a bad imitation or she recorded it in her sleep.  It says &quot;original soundtrack&quot;.  Maybe it needs to be re-mastered.  It certainly won't be my favorite+music
Any Night Fever+P+On the soundtrack to the movie STAYING ALIVE,the not-too-popular sequel to SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER,there are five original Bee Gees' compositions and recordings(THE WOMAN IN YOU,I LOVE YOU TOO MUCH,BREAKOUT,LIFE GOES ON and SOMEONE BELONGING TO SOMEONE). We hear an edited version of STAYIN' ALIVE(only the movie title carries the G). The originally released 4 minute and 42 second version of the song is heard during the film's end credits when John Travolta struts through Times Square. The film was directed by Hollywood great Sylvester Stallone,and makes a very short cameo appearance in the opening credits. Sylvester's brother Frank,appeared in the film as Tony,a bandmate of Cynthia Rhodes who played one of Travolta's love interests. Frank performs FAR FROM OVER,MOODY GIRL and with Rhodes, NEVER GONNA GIVE YOU UP. Rhodes performs FINDING OUT THE HARD WAY solo. The almost unheard of Tommy Faragher performs LOOK OUT FOR NUMBER ONE and (WE DANCE)SO CLOSE TO THE FIRE. Released in 1983 as was another Bee Gees' production,Kenny Rogers' EYES THAT SEE IN THE DARK album+music
Mediocre singing at best+N+This recording is mediocre at best.  While the University of Miami Chorale is a fantastic choir, it should shy away from certain types of songs.  It doesn't have the broad range of sounds that the far better BYU Singers or Concordia Choir does.  'Water Night' is sung well, but not appropriately.  This song should be sung without vibrato or it destroys the effect of the setting.  The dissonaces that vibrato creates takes away from the beauty of the dissonances that Mr. Whitacre has written.  Unfortunately for the listener, vibrato is used in this recording and destroys nearly all of the beauty contained in this wonderful piece.  Aside from that, the rest of the CD is neither good nor bad.  Discerning listeners will hear the differences.  The music of Rene Clausen is treated well in this recording, but not understood completely by choir or conductor.   If you're looking for a recording of 'Water Night', unfortunately this is the only one on the mass market right now and sometimes beggars can't be choosers so buy at your own risk+music
The reason why shred is dead+N+When I was 15 and first discovering guitar, I loved this album. Listening to it now, it just sounds incredibly soulless and cheesy.Vai is technically very impressive, but the man can't write a decent song to save his life. Vai's modus operandi is to get a bunch of faceless studio musicians, lay down a generic rhythm track, and go wheedily wheedily wheedily whee for an entire album.  Technique on your instrument is never a bad thing, however, technique should be just a means to an end, not the end itself. And that's what no shred guitarist seems to understand. The fact that shred guitarists like Vai aren't more popular is due to one thing: they're more concerned about playing faster and more cleanly than the next guy rather than writing songs. There's a GOOD REASON why non-guitarists hate this stuff.  Basically, once you get past the "Gee, that's neat" factor, this album, and nearly all of Vai's music, feels incredibly stiff and lifeless.To be blunt, this is what John Tesh or Yanni would sound like if they played guitar rather than keyboards. Not only that, his guitar tone is absolutely awful. Very thin, high pitched, and brittle sounding.  The best thing on here is the blatant Van Halen rip-off "The Audience is Listening": the rest is just masturbation. Vai's best work has always been as a sideman, especially the stuff he did with David Lee Roth, because then he's forced to play actual SONGS, rather than 5 minute long, tedious guitar solos. On his own, he's just unbearable. I considered giving this one star, but I gave it 2 stars due to the fact that Vai CAN play, it's just WHAT he's playing that's the problem.+music
Brutal and melodic... I f***in' love this s**t!+P+Lately I've been getting into the harsher side of Industrial/EBM and Unter Null (aka Erica Dunham) is my latest obsession. I absolutely thrive off the pulsating dance beats and just love the brutality of her voice and words, which is really more like aggressive poetry rather than screaming incoherently - making 'Sacrament' - part 1 of a twin EP concept - more appealing and accessible with its melodic abrasiveness.  Track listing goes as follows:  1. Prophecy 2. This Is Your End 3. Watch You Die 4. Playing The Fool 5. Endtime (INURE mix) 6. Disgrace (unholy remix by ADAM) 7. This Is Your End (T3CHNOPHOBIA mix) 8. Prophecy (BLANK mix+music
replacements soundtrack+N+I would have ordered this soundtrack except I actually took the time to check out the list of "songs" that were on it and to read a couple of the reviews.  Sure enough, it was exactly as I thought myself....there was only one song that I actually recognized from the movie itself, Gloria Gaynor's "I Will Survive", which is a good song, but not even close to all the other great songs which were in the movie itself, but NOT in the actual "SOUNDTRACK"!  What's up with that???  Great movie, great songs, should have a great soundtrack that is available to the fans, but it does not.  Too bad.  I understand that the person who wrote the actual "musical score" for the movie wants his due, but the fans want "their" music, too.  Do the fans not have a right to what they actually expect on the soundtrack of a movie?+music
...remains the favorite.+P+It's a tough call between this Red House offering and&quot;One More Goodnight Kiss&quot;, but this record remains my favorite Greg Brown album and one of my All-Time Favorites (mind you, most of Greg's albums appear on  that ATF list!). Each song takes you through the country, no matter wh'er  you live there or not. If you've ever sweated in a growing season or you've  walked a gravel road, this album's for you..+music
Payne's new album GROWN available NOW+P+For all those who may not know, Kendall Payne was unjustifiably cut from Capitol several years ago and was out of the music scene for quite some time. She has recently re-emerged with a brilliant independent CD, appropriately titled GROWN. Check out KENDALLPAYNE.COM for details or buy it directly at CDBABY.com. This artist needs signed again and deserves worldwide exposure. GROWN is a very, very good album that without question exceeds what she brought out five years ago with Jordan's Sister. It's very well produced, very well written, very catchy and also very heartbreaking. She's got all she had on Jordan's Sister and more on the new CD, including a track that she did with Lifehouse's Jason Wade that has a very nice vibe and distinctly Lifehouse feel. Check it out, and send this artist back to the frontlines+music
This Is What That "Cali Iz Active" Album Should've Sounded Like (Rating: 8 out of 10- -4 stars)+P+Snoop Dogg is one of my favorite rappers. I've grown up listening to him since I was a child while he was rhyming on Dr. Dre's "The Chronic". I've even stuck by him when he put out bad albums ("The Game Is Sold...") and when he dropped a decent album ("Paid The Cost..."). "The Blue Carpet Treatment" would probably be his best in over a decade if you ask me.  This album is full of laced beats and good rhymes. "Think About It" comes off real strong from Snoop laced with a dope beat. The radio hit "Thats That..." with R. Kelly gives listeners a nice R&B tune to listen to. As well as the other hit "I Wanna Love You" with Akon, another hit for this album.   As I said in my title, this is what "Cali Iz Active" should have sounded like. That CD was so horrible and failed to follow it's concept. This album followed what that concept should have been. Most of the guest appearances are form Cali. "Candy" would feature Goldie Loc, MC Eiht, E-40, and The Dogg Pound, and a real nice tune to ride to. "LAX" with Ice Cube is another standout tune that featured a sample from Biggie's "Going Back To Cali" in the hook. I'd say for some reason, my favorite song is toward the end with "Imagine" with Dr. Dre. and D'Angelo. Possibly because that piano laced throughout the song. Snoop would close the album with "Conversations" with Stevie Wonder, showing off that he's trying to get his mind right. Other guests include The Game, B-Real from Cypress Hill, George Clinton, and Kam (where the hell have YOU been Kam???).  Although this is a good CD I've heard from Snoop in a minute, it still has some rough parts. "10 Lil' Crips" sounded kinda weak to me. And I wasn't feeling the song "Beatin' Up On Yo Pads" although it's a positive song about him coaching and playing football, but it's a good song, so I'll make it my honorable mention track.  If you heard that this album was his most consistant since "Doggystyle", you heard correct. We're more than aware that he's not going to drop another one of those albums, but this is a real good one from Snoop. If other west coast artists drop albums like this, we might have the West Coast making a comeback. And being a fan of West Coast rap music, I am more than ready for it. If you thought Snoop fell off, well he gives doubters "Tha Blue Carpet Treatment".  Lyrics: A- Production: A- Guest Appearances: A- Musical Vibes: B Overall: A-  My Favorite Tracks From This Album: Think About It, Thats That..., Candy (Drippin' Like Water), Gangbangn 101, LAX, Which One Of You, I Wanna [Love] You, Psst!, Imagine, Converstions  Honorable Mention Track: Beatin' On Yo Pads  Peace Everyone!!+music
THE BEST Of THE BEST!+P+This collection of Sly and the Family Stone is simply THE BEST CUTS you can put on ONE CD! Sure,there are others like "You got Me Smilin'(again)" "Family Affair" "If you Want me to Stay" but you need more than one CD for that! These are the cuts that turned me on to this History changing music!!+music

irresistible Nicolette--catchy, sexy, fun+P+If you're a big fan of that 'laidback '70s California pop-rock sound' (and who in the right mind isn't?), then the late Nicolette Larson's 1979 album "In the Nick of Time" is an album you should definitely have in your collection. This was Nicolette's follow up to her debut album, 1978's "Nicolette", and it's actually a better album, easing off of the sappy balladry & country/ western fluff that takes up a painful amount of space on "Nicolette" in favor of infectious, no-nonsense pop-rock.  Although "In the Nick of Time" is a bit on the short side and has a few less-than-great tracks, it's largely a splendid album.  Nicolette's fun, innocently sexy presence and her irresistible, husky vocals are on full display on a bunch of ultra-catchy tracks including a couple disco-flavored tunes with "Dancin' Jones" and "Breaking Too Many Hearts", the driving, riffy pop-rocker "Just In the Nick of Time", & "Daddy" which has a piano-and-vocal barroom-style prelude before kicking into that good ol' California sound.  Also great is the breezy, feel-good ballad "Fallen", & the somewhat bossa-nova-flavored "Rio De Janeiro Blue" (which is suspiciously, and strikingly, reminiscent of Steely Dan's "Your Gold Teeth", especially with that little lick that appears at 1:56 of the track). "Back In My Arms Again", a Motown cover, isn't exactly a great song in the first place, but it's given an agreeably energetic performance. The cover of Karla Bonoff's "Isn't It Always Love" is nicely done, though it's quite similar to Karla's own version & not as strong, & the album ends in limp fashion with the dorky Little Feat cover "Trouble" which is quite annoying. The biggest hit to come from the album was the duet with Michael McDonald "Let Me Go, Love" which is a splendid, soothing ballad.  As with the previous & subsequent albums, this one was produced by Ted Templeman, & it seems he & Nicolette were an ideal match. If all you have by Nicolette is her compilation CD "The Very Best of Nicolette Larson" on Rhino Records and you think it's all you need of her, think again--the only track from "In the Nick of Time" included on there is "Let Me Go, Love".  Originally released in October of 1979 on Warner Bros., a big thumbs up to Wounded Bird Records for reissuing this highly recommended album on CD in February of 2005--the sound quality on this version is phenomenal.  Wounded Bird commonly releases two-fers, i.e. CDs with two albums on 1 disc; it would have been perfectly logical to pair this album with her first album "Nicolette"--they would EASILY fit on a single CD--but it's still a pleasure to see that they've been re-released, and hopefully these reissues will help to introduce new listeners and remind old listeners of the numerous gems these albums contain.  For any Nicolette fan, "In the Nick of Time" is unquestionably a must-have.+music
I second that emotion!+P+Yo its like Sean B. Dady said+music
Not a good remix+N+This is one of the few remixes that left me hanging. There was no imagination. What's the point?+music
Sure sounded like a good idea...+N+Bob Dylan's work has been adapted to all kinds of musical styles, and you'd think reggae would be a perfect fit, since, like Dylan, it often fuses of the spiritual and the political and both Dylan and many reggae artists have a fondness for lush but not gooey romantic ballads (No Woman No Cry etc).  But this CD really doesn't work for me. I like my reggae rootsy (as far as I'm concerned, Lee Perry is God, or I guess Jah), and this sounds like slick, soulless beer commercial reggae, the kind of thing you'd probably hear at a resort pool party. Producer Doctor Dread has a very unfortunate fondness for smooth jazz sax, cocktail lounge guitar and sacharine flutes. It's all very professional, yes. These are some of the top studio musicians in Jamaica (Sly, Chinna) and they hit all the right notes. But they're just picking up a paycheck. After this session it sounds like they could well have laid down some tracks for a Jamaican Tourist Board spot.  Some of it is okay. Toots is always great, Apple Gabriel has a wonderful molasses-and-ganja voice, Michael Rose makes an interesting choice in The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carrol and Sizzla turns Subterannean Homesick Blues into a dancehall song, which works surprisingly well (and I don't like dancehall). The cover of Gotta Serve Somebody is pretty good too, partly because it was recorded separately from the rest of the CD so the backing music isn't so cold and efficient. You should probably just cherry-pick these from iTunes.  But even many of the good performances are sabotaged by that awful by-the-numbers studio sound.+music
Great music, unfortunately all re-recordings.+N+I've been a Merle Haggard fan all my life and this CD is about as great as he gets. But, if you want the original recordings of these hits, look elsewhere+music
Best since Doggystyle+P+In my opinion this is Snoop's second best album even today, behind you guessed it, Doggystyle.  That said it isn't even close to being as good as Doggystyle, but it is still a good album and after Da Game... and the slightly dissapointing Doggfather this can be viewed as a comeback almost.  Da Game.... featured No Limit production and loads of appearances by No Limit rappers, and as a result was wack, both have been cut back here.  Snoop must have put his foot down and asked to bring in his own producers for No Limit Top Dogg, including of course Dre, for the first time since Doggystyle.  There are also less No Limit rappers (any is too many though) featured, but surprisingly few appearances by his old West Coast homies.  Anyway best track is easily B*tch Please, which is a classic in any era, Snoop's verses are tight but Xzibit is really the star of this track, as he makes what was really his mainstream breakthrough.  My other top tracks are Buck Em, Just Dippin (both Dre produced unsuprisingly), Betta Days, Down 4 my Nig*az and Trust Me.  Snoop also displays his impressive storytelling abilities on Snoopafella, where he basically re-tells Cinderella from his perspective.  Most of the other tracks are at least good, and the production for the most part is tight, though the album is not without filler (Gangsta Ride, In Love With A Thug).  Overall this is an impressive album from Snoop, yes it is not Doggystyle, I don't think there ever will be another one.  People have the tendency to mark Snoop albums against Doggystyle, rather than on their own merit unfortunately though. I'd give it 4 stars, recommended+music
wow.+N+I can't even believe alkaline trio even let that be put on a cd, that is terrible+music
Recommended for insomniacs - but 5 stars for the title track+N+Sadly, one of the greatest rock songs of all time finds itself on one of the most boring rock albums of all time.  To add insult to injury, the notes on the CD cover proudly boast of 'a full eight months recording' time, which had been 'preceded by a year and a half of reflection and writing'.  We're talking 26 months here, surely time enough to produce a decent album.  Instead, they produced their only good song, which I'll say again, is an acknowledged classic, only hated by true Eagles fans, as most true fans hate the classics of their favourite bands.  If an unknown band had tried to get a record deal at that time on the basis of the rest of the filler, I seriously doubt they'd have been successful.  For good use of studio time see what can be done with just 30 HOURS of it on Led Zeppelin I+music
I Love Merle Haggerd+N+I love this guy I think his music is total boss. To bad there ain't no more Okie from Masgokie on the tube anymore. I used to sing along to that song in my station wagon all the time. Great music from a man of many talents+music

Derivative and uncompelling+N+America was formed by Dan Peek, Dewey Bunnel and Gerry Beckley, three US military brats living in London. America generally sounds like either a third rate Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young or Barclay James Harvest (who were all ready a second rate Moody Blues) without any new ideas of their own. This 1975 compliation does however have the advantage of collecting all of their hits without wading through some of the painful filler on their individual albums+music

Promise Ring breaking new ground+P+Wood / Water breakouts with a new maturity on this departure from the usual emo - core sound the band has cultivated over the years. A band that has been a cult favorite presents an unyielding indie - pop classic that begs to be listened to over and over. The old fan may be thrown for a loop at first listen but after several listens, the depth of the writing and complex arrangements become a staple of your CD player. Buy this CD+music
Won't Play+N+I ordered two copies of this CD, one for me and one for my daughter.  It will not play on my CD player, a Technics model.  We have never had anything like this happen before.  My spouse took the CD to a neighbor's home and was able to play it on his player.  On the strength of that, I gave my daughter her copy.  I have no idea whether she has tried to play it or not.  My guess is that she won't until next Christmas.  She is overworked and that won't be a high priority.  In case you are wondering, our CD player continues to work well, playing all our other CDs+music
oh well+N+I never write reviews for the cds I buy, but felt the need for this one.  NFG seemed to be maturing with Catalyst, but sadly went back to writing the same thing they always wrote.  I tried listening to the cd a lot to get hooked, but it's weaker than their self-titled.  They grew for the next two albums into something bigger and better, and then lost it all.  This album is super poppy, which is ok, but the lyrics are some of their worst.  I know some might disagree, and that's fine.  I just wanted to warn people, if you liked the direction they were going in catalyst, then you'll probably see this one as a step backwards.  Sorry NFG!  I still love you!  In a manly hitting each other sort of way+music
There's so much better stuff out there+N+I saw Barrage last night.  They're not great dancers, and they're not great musicians.  The music is just loud, new age, junk, similar to what I imagine Yanni or John Tesh probably plays+music
This is a classic!+P+&quot;The Best of the Heartbeats&quot; is  a classic!  The romantic lyrics, the perfect harmony, and the wonderful lead singer, &quot;Shep&quot; all make this CD appealing to listeners of all ages and  tastes+music
Personal Favorite+P+Jimi Hendrix is arguably the all time Master of the Guitar.  He has yet to be outdone in spite of the decades since his passing.  While I enjoy the sort of Hendrix tunes played frequently on the radio, many songs just aren't heard unless one owns the album.  South Saturn Delta is one of my personal favorites.  If you enjoy First Rays of the New Rising Sun, or Axis: Bold as Love, any Hendrix fan would appreciate this collection as much if not more.  Play on Jimi+music
7.5/10+P+_In the Fishtank_ is an ongoing venture of an independent record company that allows the free exchange of musical ideas between (usually) two bands. Ultimately, the _Fishtank_ delivers exactly what it promises: a veritable fusion of the bands in question to create a sound that in itself is unique, but could also realistically (though far-fetched perhaps) fit in with any of the individual artists' other recordings. The bands involved with this volume of _Fishtank_ are Isis and Aereogramme, two bands that have some overlapping qualities, but aren't exactly the same by any means. This is the first and only _Fishtank_ volume I have heard as of yet, but it is apparently a great success on more than one level.  "Low Tide" starts with a tender, echoing melody that sprouts like an elaborately blooming plant. The reverberating music seems to lean more towards the style of Isis, but the singer of Aereogramme handles the vocals. My first impression was that the vocals sounded a bit like Maynard James Keenan's quivering falsetto. Just a bit. Well maybe a bit more than a bit. Either way, they sounded good. The track builds up with a pulsing bass line and industrial rhythm then calmly dissipates into the vast void of the sea. "Delial" gets off to a heavier start, and the hollow vocals of Isis' Turner become shrouded in a driving rhythm that evolves into an abrasive screech.  The third track, "Stolen" is more relaxed, with an extremely peaceful orchestration forming the bulk of the song, which trails off into an ambient mix of synths and natural sound effects.  The _Fishtank_ concept is a good idea, and it provides a bridge of discovery for fans of both bands involved. For having only two days to produce the songs, I'd say both bands did a great job. I would also say that both fanbases will enjoy this, and for the price, it is another good impulse buy if you're looking for something new. Actually, I recommend getting all three albums in the Isis/Aereogramme trilogy that I have reviewed, along with _In the Absense of Truth_ and _Seclusion_, and listening to them in succession with the _Fishtank_ in their midst. All else aside, this volume has prompted me to seek out the others+music
good, but not up to  gangsta's paradise+P+coolio's latest album is alright but some of the songs just didn't make much sense+music
Therion Junior+N+Let me start off by saying that I am a fan of operatic metal. I love Therion, Theatre of Tragedy, Tristiana, Lacuna Coil, Nightwish, all of the bands that any self respecting music fan should listen to. However, I should have seen this one coming. I must say, witohut a frickin doubt, this is the cheesiest album that I have ever had the displeasure of listening to. I shelled out 15 bucks for this album and I wish that I saved my money and bought a knife and stabbed myself in the frickin eardrums, and then bought a bucket of sulfuric acid and drowned myself in it. The band overall has good musicianship, (and their singer is hot), yet they write sub par music with cheesy medieval themes. THe band has potential, and it might help if the f***in music video wasn't a sing along with the words at the bottom of the screen. Please, if you are considering purchasing this album, dont make the same mistake I did, and buy Therion's Lemuria/Sirius B. Trust me, you'll be glad you shelled out the extra 5 clams+music
Why waste your money?+N+I know you're excited, and you want everything to be perfect and planned down to the tiniest detail, and you're working on [probably] the biggest budget you've ever had to work with, but PLEASE save the $__.__ and buy yourself a new 8-hour lipstick instead. Then go to the library, and oogle over how many of these ridiculous CDs they have for you to listen to for free. Trust me, once you decide on your songs, you'll never listen to the CD again+music

missing something+N+Based on my affitnity for the blues/rck genre and the 5 star rating of Joe's playing I picked up the CD/DVD combo(Amazon) and was, I hate to admit it, dissappointed. Granted, he can play and has good chops, but for me, something was missing. Maybe that intangible. The fire that comes through  the amps. Not that his playing was not emotional or inspired form his point of view, but for me it was lacking. I need to watch it again to see if I feel the same way. Like the a previous two star reviewer, I would have enjoyed seeing this guy in a local bar or someone's basement and would walked away satisfied. But when you start playing with the big boys, this guy comes up short+music
Start here if you're new to Branford+P+This is the first Branford I heard (back in 1990) and I've heard a lot of him since.  I sometimes find his stuff hard to get into, but his sound is so pure and the music so honest and driving that I keep coming back to it.  Also, and this is definitely worth mentioning, his band is hot and Jeff &quot;Tain&quot; Watts is an astonishing drummer.  In any event, Contemporary Jazz, The Dark Keys, Bloomington, The Beautyful Ones, and especially the recent Footsteps of our Fathers are all quite stunning albums, but they require comfort with free and intense music.  If you already dig 60's Coltrane and Ornette, go for it.  If not, and you want to jump in and hear why people think Branford is so good, Crazy People Music is a great place to start.  You get the fiery intensity of the later albums, but the tracks are easier to digest and the melodicism of the themes (and the solos) is more accessible to those less familiar with his style.  I wouldn't start any earlier in his career, because you get his more &quot;bop&quot; influenced style, which he has evolved past (though he still has that sweet tone).  Trio Jeepy is another place to start, but I think it too, though a fine album, doesn't give a complete sense of his mature sound.  I gave this four stars, because it's not his most amazing work, but I do love it and have come back to it regularly over the last twelve years.  If this gets its hooks in you, you'll like the later albums; if this sounds overwhelming and, well, crazy, you'll probably find the later albums only more so+music
Harry can do no wrong+P+I've followed Harry for years and have always enjoyed his albums because each one has a slightly different sound from the rest.  This latest CD is light, has gentle compositions, and is also swingin' fun.  It puts me in the mood for dancing under the stars or curling up by the fire.  I think it's about time Harry did a CD like this+music
Pass Me The CTA Please...+N+I remember listening to a radio station that was giving away as many records as you could name in 10 seconds.  The caller gets on and says, "Chicago 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 etc.  I guess Hot Streets would have slowed the process.....Anyways Hot Streets is further document of Chicagos gradual descent into easy listening oblivion and oh what a dreadful place that is...+music
Music that Moves You+P+Listening to this brilliant series of tunes is like taking a long breath of fresh air.  It truly touches the soul. I bought the CD on &quot;spec&quot; after hearing a couple of tracks about 5 months ago. Smart  move!   Over time, it has become the A, number one listening choice for  almost everthing I do. There is true beauty and depth in each track.  It is  well worth the money spent.  I'm looking for anything else Luis and the UN  band might have recorded.  Don't hesitate. you won't be sorry+music
Very pretty, somewhat boring+N+This recording of the new works by Theofanidis and Higdon is first rate. Great performances, and nice to hear along side the Copland, which stands out as the real masterpiece. Mind you, Theofanidis and Higdon are obviously really talented composers.  I like new music. I like beautiful music. And I don't usually mind if the new music I hear is beautiful or ugly, has a tune, or not. What matters is that I am pulled in, and not lulled in with cliches or pandering.  The Theofanidis seemed to be much more interesting  to listen to than the Higdon. His sense of orchestral color is very strong. But overall, their music is very pretty, and somewhat boring. Get this to hear that great Copland: it is the piece that on this CD that pulls you in to listen. I know this piece is not the new piece on the CD, but it really stands the test of time against the more recent works+music
Disc 1 is superb...disc 2 is so-so+P+MY feeling of Europe '72 is this: Love, love, love disc 1. Every song is performed with energy, great jams and one of my favorite Tennesse Jed's ever. Disc 2 on the other hand bores me a bit. Truckin' is great, but the Prelude&gt;Morning Dew is boring to me. But the bonus material (starting with a beautiful and etheral Looks like Rain) redeems it. So not a perfect live disc, no other official releases truly shows the creative live peak musically and songwriting-erly (is that a word?) the boys were in 1972, in the midst of their prime+music
Should Be Called Poop Diddy+N+Nothing hear, just the same aimless blabbing and complaining about how the streets currupted a young man. Whoa, if i could only make a song about my messed up childhood and make billions, I would be richer than these wannabe softees out int the hip hop scene.+music
Still great after 15 years of listening+P+My mom bought this years ago and I still think it's wonderful music for Christmas.  Definitely buy this album.+music
A good collection+P+This release by "20th Century Masters" is part two of their Loretta Lynn Greatest Hits compilation.  This one covers the second part of her career, and like Vol. 1, the sound and recordings are clear and original.  There are 12 songs here, beginning with "Wine, Women, and Song" and "Fist City", and ending with "I Lie".  In between, there is a duet with Conway, and the controversial "The Pill".  Yes, there could've been more songs included, or even more popular songs chosen instead of those provided here, but this is a solid offering that will not disappoint+music
The Most horrible Bone CD I've Ever heard!!+N+After i heard the new Bone CD i had much faith in this new release from Layzie, although his previous efforts were all , very admittedly, bombs.  And unfortunately this new release was no change for Layzie Bone. It seems as if a Layzie with out the Thugs is not a good deal.. With no "hardcore" or "Club Worthy" songs , his CD lacks anything truly listenable...honestly, his lyrics don't even represent his talent on his solo releases...Will Somebody please tell Layzie to not release solo albums!! He is tarnishing his reputation as a rap artist!+music
Definitive+P+This is one of the best albums of the last 25 years and certainly one of the best I have ever heard. If you like good music like the Beatles, Kinks, Rolling Stones, Wilco, Fountains of Wayne, Beck, Coldplay, Prince, or Radiohead, then you will probably not be disappointed by this CD+music
No impact+N+I'll probably never run out of music to discover. It seems that no matter how many stones I turn, no matter how exhaustive my search is, there will always be atleast a few gems I'd somehow overlooked. For me, XTC are one of those gems. I picked up Black Sea at the local record shop and it completely knocked me out. Maybe it was those huge drums, or the way everything felt like it was pulling apart at the seams. Regardless of what it was, I had to have more. Over the course of the next few weeks I proceeded to buy Drums and Wire followed by English settlement. Again, both were completely stellar albums, especially D & W.  Then there was Skylarking. It was supposed to be THE XTC album, their masterpiece. People compared it to the likes of Pet sounds and proclaimed it one of the best albums of all time. I'm sad to say it didn't live up to the hype for me. In fact, I find it to be downright mediocre. For me this is where they dropped the ball and failed to pick it back up. I'll admit that I miss the more raw, punk like energy that was found in early XTC, but that's not why I dislike this album. I actually enjoy alot of mellow, lavishly produced music, but Skylarking just sounds...bland. None of the songs seem to stand out and the production is borderline soft rock. Every time I listen I hear less of what made me love XTC in the first place and more of why I can't stand Phil Colins. Even the songwriting itself is weak, lacking strong hooks and any sort of weight to help the music rise out of the syrupy muck that Todd Rundgren laid out. I just don't see what all the fuss is about.+music
Classic Hicks+P+"I get pulled over by the cops, I be so drunk I'd be out dancing to their lights thinking I made it to another club." "...Turn the music up!! Hey what is this - a leather bar? I am not into this you fags!"    Hicks delivers on stuff like this every second line. The Dangerous album is a riot. Get Hicks if you have never heard him. He is probably one of the best undiscovered comedy acts of the 20th century, died from cancer shortly after his peak+music
The Coincidence of Roots+P+A brilliant work, and no this review isn't of much help really, but I'd like to forward a theory about the guitar solo in the prog rocker Roots of Coincidence: PM had been listening to Tribal Tech guitarist Scott Henderson in the mid 90's as Scott moved away from compositional jazz-fusion toward fearless, bluesy, attitude-driven free-form guitar, decided Scott was having way too much fun at it - and with songs like "Canine" on TT's Face First who could argue? - thusly deciding to stake his claim on this invigorating new ground. It's good, interesting, but fleeting and disjointed, and Scott does it better. Still, what PMG here, on Imaginary Day as elsewhere, are able to render as musical generalists, by selecting from the full pallette of sonic colors and using each to maximum effect, ah! This, the artistic specialists and the attitude-driven often by contrast find elusive+music
German Composer Richard Wagner would be pleased!+P+I was around 16 or 17 when this record was released, and it was another Masterpiece by the Kings of Metal! This release, like the three before it, is part of the foundation of Manowar's Kingdom. This is one of my favorite Cd's of all time. It has some of the Heaviest moments in Manowar history, it's raw, stripped down, and heavy. This is what True Heavy Metal is all about. If I were going to give somebody a few CD's  to give them an idea of what Manowar is really about, it would be the first 4 CD's, because they truly are a great period for the band. During that time period, information about Manowar was hard to come by  here in the United States; the media ignored them, and the critics panned them, and neither had a just cause for doing so - Manowar's musical abilities far outweighed any of the bands that were getting coverage. Joey DeMaio is still the most original  bassist around, Eric Adams' voice is simply unbelievable (I've studied voice for the last 6 years - trust me, the guy is incredible). Scott Columbus is simply my favorite drummer. I began playing drums well over 20 years ago, and John Bonham was quickly replaced by Scott Columbus; and we finally come to Ross the Boss - there is not another guitarist around who has the style that Ross has.   The first 4 releases were recorded in Analog - that's why the releases that came out after this had a much different sound, the band began utilizing Digital Recording equipment for the following releases. For me, this CD was the end of an era, because Manowar's sound changed and became a bit more polished and less raw, and it wasn't until they released Triumph of Steel that they regained a lot of the rawness that the digital recording medium of the late 80's seemed to kill.   That said, I would highly recommend this CD to anyone wanting to get a taste of what Manowar was really about.+music
No baloobalot here+N+I was disappointed that the "Open Your Eyes (Baloobalot Hot House Piano Dub)" by Rhythm Scholar was not on this CD.  It's really the only Donovan worth listening to.  Skip this and get something by Ochwat & Sam or Spanky My Monkey instead+music
A Mistake+N+To be honest, I must have hit a button by mistake which caused me to order something I really hadn't intended on buying.  There was no way to cancel it on-line so I figured I'd give the CD a listen, since I had Nellie's first CD, which I love.   I must say, I was disappointed.  Just seemed like every song sounded the same.  Maybe it will grow on me, the more I listen to it, but kinda doubting it+music
NOT GOOD!!+N+In my opinion, this is one of the worst things Reba has ever done.  Most of the songs are the typical pop flavored stuff that country music has become these days.  Its too bad and its an irony too because back in the 1980s she revitalized the traditionalist movement along with George Strait and Ricky Skaggs.  Why did she change??  To record stuff like this???  Awful+music
REGRETS+N+This CD I regret to say is not up to Reba's standard of performance.  She's done much better. +music
Weak...Especially PB on the Guitar+N+Wow...I thought this album was going to be "Too Damn Hot"...it is "So Damn Not" that it's frightening.    The tunes are weak, the Doctor's playing is OKAY but not inspired and Bernstein's guitar playing is beyond lame.  I've seen Bernstein at a club uptown and he was decent at best (better comping, not a great soloist) but this album doesn't display the best of either of these wonderful musicians' capabilities+music
Bring back Bushwick and get rid of Willie-D.....+N+Arrrrgggghhh! This was the worst Geto Boys offering I have heard to date! Obviously Scarface wasn't enough to save this &quot;album&quot;. Why wasn't Bushwick in on this one? Most of the songs were performed by Willie-D and  I'm sorry but Willie-D can't rap! There isn't one single song on  this album that I would refer to anyone! This GB product deserves to be put  in the trash. I'm a true Geto Boys fan and I say to other GB fans out  there: DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!!!+music
Jay at his all time best.+P+If you want to relive your days in the 60' use this CD to bring back old memories of what you were up to then. Fantastic, even better than before enhanced by CD quality+music
Stranger No More+P+I bought this for my dad, (a Willie fan) but having a chance to listen myself found it to be a charming, innovative amalgamation of simple, sincere, sometime sinister, musical thought based on a recurring theme. A " stand alone" accomplishment from an American icon+music
A little disappointed+N+There were multiple recordings of some of the same songs on this ablum. I can see doing maybe one song, two different ways. However, there was one song done three different ways and another song done twice which almost sounded the same+music
Joni's standards+P+Although not a document of a working band, this is clearly a record Dave Douglas wanted to make. Following in the tradition of his sextet in honouring the compositions of particular composers, he has drawn together  the sympathetic talents of James Genus, Bill Carrothers and Billy Hart to  pay tribute to Joni Mitchell. Hers is music he obviously loves, the  reconstructions sounding like jazz standard song repertoire. The other  music uses Joni Mitchell's ear for a great tune as a springboard for Dave's  thoughtful, instantly appealing compositions. Beautifully recorded, this is  a one-off; don't miss it+music
AAH+N+You know this guy did appeal to me at first, but if you have this CD youve heard American Bad Ass, right? Listen to Metallicas &quot;Sad But True&quot;. He ripped off the guitar part completely. H e tries to be metal, hardcore rap, and country at the same time. Fails miserably. He is a talentless wigger. Wait...thats too nice. I hope he commits suicide+music
The start of a string of brilliant works+P+This is, perhaps, The Rolling Stones' masterpiece. After the disaster that was "His Satanic Majesty's Request" the band clearly decided to stop slavishly copying trends (and, one might add, following in The Beatles' footsteps).   Brian Jones appears only sporadically, it's his last album with the band. The Stones brought in Jimmy Miller to produce, after having learned the hard way that they work best when they have someone besides Mick and Keith at the mixing board. Nicky Hopkins' contribution to this album can't be understated. Rumor has it that Ry Cooder participated in the sessions.  "Sympathy For The Devil" kicks things off. For an inside look at the evolution of this iconic song see Jean Luc Godard's "One Plus One" (aka "Sympathy For The Devil"). This song was scary and groundbreaking back in 1967 - now that we've all heard it 1,000+ times it seems far too familiar. In my opinion this is one of Mick's best lyrics.  "No Expectations" is a beautiful song, with lovely piano work by Hopkins. The lyric is a bit trite, but it works. Believe it or not this was the first single - it's perhaps the weakest song on the album.  "Dear Doctor" is really, really funny. The Stones were fans of country music, but here they take on the form as a cliche. "For the gal I'm to marry / Is a bow-legged sow / I've been soakin' up drink like a sponge." This is a hoot.  "Stray Cat Blues" - another reviewer stated that this is a homage to fans of the band. Jeez, I hope not! This is very creepy stuff. Mick's growls in the intro are absolutely filthy ("Yeah, just don't care..."). He sings this like an utter pervert, which is the point. "Well I can see that you're 15 years old / But I don't want your ID." By now it's obvious to the listener that The Stones have reinvented themselves - where did this sound come from? It's unlike anything we've heard on previous Stones albums.   "Jigsaw Puzzle" - many fans don't care for this song. It's a bit of a throwback, somewhat reminiscent of "Something Happened To Me Yesterday" and a few others from the previous incarnations of the band. Mick's lyric is a bit overwritten, but the final verse in particular is quite good. The band jams out well here - Keith, Wyman and Hopkins play off one another brilliantly, particularly in the coda. It's a fine side-ender.  "Street Fighting Man" - some of this was recorded in a living room. The basic drums are Charlie banging on telephone directory books. Some of the guitars were recorded on a cheap tape deck. The sitar is Brian; more amazing Hopkins piano here. This was, I believe, the start of Keith using the famous "open G" tuning he has employed since. A solid song, but I've always thought it a bit over-rated.  "Prodigal Son" - country blues, based on the Bible story. Mick's lyric is perfect, as is his vocal delivery. No contemporary British band could sound as authentically American when doing this style of blues.  "Parachute Woman" - more blues, but now we move from the Delta to the Big City. Bill Wyman has often referred to this is his all-time favorite Stones track. The sound is (purposefully?) muddy, and it feels perhaps a bit off-hand at first listen - but give it a chance. This is powerful stuff.    "Factory Girl" - an underrated gem. It's a beautiful song with a lilting melody, a fun yet poignant lyric, and a wonderful performance by all. "Waitin' for a girl who's got stains all down her dress / waitin' for a girl and my feet are gettin' wet / she ain't come out yet / waitin' for a factory girl" - that's as fine a depiction of working class life as I've yet come across.   "Salt Of The Earth" - the first verse is Keith Richard's first lead vocal on record. This is a stirring song, an apt followup to "Factory Girl." I wasn't at all surprised that this was a song Mick and Keith chose to perform at "The Concert For NYC." The vamp in the last 1/3 or so of this song is brilliant musicianship.  If one is familiar with The Rolling Stones only as a "hit" group, this album could be disappointing - there's no obvious Top Ten hit here. But if you appreciate music, and if you know anything about the history of this group, you will appreciate the fact that this was a groundbreaking album.   There isn't a bad track here. Each is brilliant in its own way. And, of course, this was the first of five great albums produced by The Stones - "Beggar's Banquet," "Let It Bleed," "Get Yer Ya Ya's Out," "Sticky Fingers," and "Exile On Main Street." They had never before reached these heights - and never would again.  The Rolling Stones are regarded by most fans and critics as contemporaries of The Beatles and Bob Dylan ("The Holy Trinity" of the 60's) on the strength of the five albums noted above. They had a lot of hits before "Beggar's Banquet," but if that was all they'd done they would be regarded as equals to The Animals or The Yardbirds, etal. They became rock royalty when they produced "Beggar's Banquet.+music
A pretty weak album - 2.5 stars +N+Slayer released Diablos in Musica in 1998.  This is a decent thrash album, but definitely not up to Slayer's standards.  Yeah, some people think Slayer sucks and they say they are over-rated.  These people are entitled to their opinion.  That being said, Diablos really is Slayers weakest album.  Maybe Tom Araya was able to sing in 1988, but his singing 10 years later just ruins the music.  His normal vocals are ok, but when he sings or tries a spoken word section, it really shows that he should stick with what he knows (if only James Hetfield took my advise; his voice makes me want to puke now).  Songs like Death's Head, Stain of Mind, Love to Hate are probably the worst Slayer songs they wrote up to this point.    This is the Slayer album I listen to the least.  There are song good songs:  Bitter Peace, Overt Enemy, Scrum and Screaming From The Sky.  Too bad the rest of the album is rather boring. +music
too much talking and not enough music+N+I did not expect a primer on Indian music.  I expectd, instead  examples of songs in different styles.  This CD does do that to a limited extent, but Ravi Shankar spends too much time instructing the audience.  The music that is presented seems rough and un rehearse+music
very dissapointing+N+I bought this record assuming the songs would be as poignant and memorable as those on II. Instead, I found the music to be busy and impersonal, and I thought the lyrics (once again in comparison to those on II) sucked. Its often said that Up on the Sun demonstrates the Meat Puppets coming into their own 'sound', and that its a vast improvement over II. I fail to see how their work on II was any less of a genuine expresssion of the bands vision than this frankly dull piece of work+music
A timely celebration of a "double" 50-year anniversary.+P+A half century ago, I was a junior in high school. We used to have these gatherings called "assemblies," where the principal would collect the entire student body in the auditorium (no excuses allowed!) for an event of more than passing importance. At this late date, I can only remember a small handful of them: the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, President Truman relieving General MacArthur of his command. Oh, and one where two fellows from Ampex came to our high school to give a little demonstration of something called "stereophonic sound," using, needless to say, an Ampex tape recorder.  And the music for this demonstration? It was the brief opening prologue ("Sunrise") from Richard Strauss's "Also Sprach Zarathustra," in this very same Reiner/Chicago Symphony Orchestra recording. This was a "sneak preview to end all sneak previews," inasmuch as the monophonic LP ("New Orthophonic," I believe it was called) hadn't even been released at that early date. And, needless to say, this impressionable teenager was suitably impressed. So much so that, in the years to come, I acquired three LPs of the performance: the original monophonic LP, then the Living Stereo LP a few years later, and eventually, when the stereo LP had seen its better days, the Dynagroove rerelease (something I'd just as soon forget). I never did go the reel-to-reel route, and, when CDs eventually made their appearance, I opted for other performances of these two Strauss works rather than the earlier conventional Living Stereo CD release. But I always did have fond memories of that particular reel-to-reel tape demonstration back in '54; it was a direct copy of the 30ips master tape, and not the 7.5ips "consumer" version that came out shortly thereafter.  With BMG now releasing half-century-old Living Stereo classics as hybrid SACDs (10 at present, with surely more on the way), it was easy for me to select this recording as one of the first to sample. I was more than pleasantly surprised; just listening to the "Also Sprach Zarathustra" prologue had the effect of turning the clock back 50 years; truly a trip down Memory Lane!  In a phrase, I wasn't disappointed. Even listening to the conventional CD layer, it was easy to get the sense that there I was again, listening to the 30ips master tape. Even with headphones, I heard no evidence of tape hiss; just beautifully balanced stereo sound with a tremendous sense of not only left-to-right spatial array but depth as well. (This is particularly evident in "The hero's battlefield" segment of "Ein Heldenleben," where the initial muted trumpet fanfares sound as if they are coming from well behind the orchestra.) Throughout both massive tone poems, the music is well-served by RCA's "minimalistic" microphoning, with just two mikes picking up the sound field, and every single instrumental voice (and there are many of them) can clearly be heard. (Sir Thomas Beecham, that evergreen source of bon mots, reserved one of his best for "Ein Heldenleben" when he wrote that "I once spent a couple of days in a train with a German friend. We amused ourselves by discovering how many notes we could take out of 'Ein Heldenleben' and leave the music essentially intact. By the time we finished we had taken out fifteen thousand.")  As for Reiner's interpretations, perhaps the simplest way of putting it is that there is no time in the last half century that I can recall when these two performances were NOT included in EVERY "essential recordings" discography (even when the sound quality was not as it is here, in the hybrid SACD release). Reiner had a way of not oversentimentalizing these two works, as if they had been the products of one of the world's greatest egos, which, in fact, they were: Strauss made no bones about himself being the hero of "Ein Heldenleben." Reiner keeps things moving along, lest they bog down for the empty rhetoric that they can often be in lesser hands.  A century ago, when Strauss had been the most famous composer who was also a conductor and Gustav Mahler had been the most famous conductor who was also a composer, audiences couldn't get enough of the Strauss tone poems. (I think, in fact, that the record will show that Mahler conducted Strauss's tone poems more frequently than he did his own symphonies!)  And a half-century ago, when I had been in my musical adolescence, so to speak, I too couldn't get enough of them. But they haven't worn all that well in the intervening years. Now, considerably older and modestly wiser, I can only take them in infrequent doses. (Perhaps I've simply taken Strauss at his word when he described himself as "a first-rate second-rate composer.") And, fortunately for this now-jaded me, these Reiner performances, long perfect in everything but sound quality, have arrived with, finally, sound quality that matches the performances.  I have every expectation that future "essential  recordings" discographies will continue to include these performances, now with this newly-refurbished sound quality that is the match of any.  Bob Zeidle+music
not true Muddy+N+This album was a disappointment. I was looking forward to Muddy's covers of &quot;Caldoinia&quot; and &quot;Kansas City&quot; but it wasnt what I thought itd be. Dont get me wrong, Muddy himself was fine, but he gets  overshadowed by the musical collaborators. There is an overuse of harmonica  and organ, and the annoying presence of ACCORDIAN! Accordians and Waters do  not mix. This over-instrumentalization leaves the album sounding lame and  folky and not bluesy. If you're looking for Muddy's later work, try  &quot;Blues Sky&quot;, with Muddy working with Johnny Winter and his back  to basics production+music
No more soundtracks Mr. Eastwood, Please!+N+I tried not to give it any stars, which is what it deserves.  I have a difficult time understanding why Mr. Eastwood continues to write the soundtrack to the films he's involved in.  There are composers like Harry Gregson-Williams, Elliot Goldenthal, James Newton Howard, David Julyan, Mark Isham, etc... that can create something meaningful and 10 times more advanced than what "Dirty Harry" can create.  Would the director and executives of another major motion picture accept a soundtrack of this quality?    I hated Mystic River's soundtrack as well.  I think he got lucky with Million Dollar Baby.  Not much music that might have ruined the acting, and no inspirational music when she is winning all the fights, unlike the Rocky movies.    I am very aware that he doesn't posess the education, training, and experience that all of the major Hollywood composers do.  But he should stick to acting and directing.  He has proven himself to be very good at both of those with the awards he has recieved in his lifetime.  I think he is just trying to show off at how much he can contribute to a movie.  And his "music" is nothing noteworthy at all, in my opinion.     While his attempt to write another score is surprising, it leaves so much to be desired in a film like Flags of Our Fathers.  It's a tremendous film, with an interesting story, great characters, great acting, and authentic battle scenes, much like Saving Private Ryan (John Williams).  They have a meaningful well-made film ready for a composer to add thier ideas and talents to, and make a great movie-going experience.  And then we get the same boring nursery rhyme style melody and chord progression over and over and over again.  And then on top of that, it's rudementally orchestrated between guitar, piano, and trumpet with those long droning strings.  Granted, not much to work with for Lennie Niehaus who orchestrated it.    I got so sick of it on just one viewing only.  And the scene when the son is looking at the pictures and the medal, as stupidly simple as that melody is, I think it's completely intrusive in that scene.  It ruined a moment that could have been very moving with anything different musically, or maybe no music at all.  I believe everyone has a job when making a movie, and when one person is doing too much, the quality suffers.  And that's if Clint Eastwood was an educated composer, which he isn't.  No one can deny that, not even him.  As I mentioned before there are so many composers out there that could have made that film even more moving and powerful.  I think that the executives looked the other way and let something like this happen because of a big name like Clint Eastwood.  Film music is an evolving art form constantly struggling to get the recognition it deserves.  And with good moives being made that are horribly scored in this way, it's not helping the film music world at all.  It is admirable for someone to try new things and contribute in ways not thought of before.  But when they don't have any talent, they shouldn't be allowed to do it.  I am an aspiring film composer taking classes, going to movies, and buying soundtracks to learn as much as I can about it.  It gives me a moment of pause when decisions like this are being made about major films.  I know it's just Clint Eastwood attempting this, but what if more actors and/or non-composers try doing it?    Please, no more soundtracks Mr. Eastwood!  You do what you are good at and leave the music to the established, experienced, and well-known composers of Hollywood.  Bryan Arata             +music
Mastered the Art+P+Listening to 'Mastered the Art' is the acoustic equivalent of running your hand over shag carpet that hasn't been vacuumed since the seventies - it reveals a surprising accumulation of hidden textures and diverse beats, from Spanish-style acoustic guitars and menacing orchestration to xylophones and Galaga samples (you know the tractor beam sound just before your ship gets taken up). 'Mastered the Art' is a gigantic mixed-media canvas that subsumes all the brilliance of his previous albums while adding authentic variation and depth. Like any original work of art, 'Mastered the Art' is difficult to categorize - it represents the leading edge in the ongoing revolution that is combining hip-hop, jazz, groove, and funk into unique and powerful musical expressions. Greyboy is an accomplished composer and this album is a masterpiece. Now if only he'd publish the complete list of his 8-track collection. . +music
As heard in "Kill Bill"!+P+If the Astralwerks label that released this 1973 gem were clever they'd re-release it with a bright yellow sticker on the cover that says: "FEATURING: 'SUPER 16', AS HEARD IN THE NEW QUENTIN TARATINO MOVIE KILL BILL VOL.1!!!" Then watch the sales of NEU! 2 surge its way up to the top of the Billboard album charts, purchased by young hipsters salivating for any and all obscure references incorporated into the cult movie flick.  Okay, that may never happen, but still, it was quite a treat to hear the brief snippet of "Super 16"'s turntable sludge ooze from the speakers of Tarantino's movie. "Super 16" might serve a few seconds of quirky soundtrack music, but as representation of the superb, and breif, discography of NEU!'s body of work it does the band a great disservice. Hearing this track rekindled my interest in NEU!'s music again, and to write this review.  NEU! 2 is perhaps best approached as two halves, the first half, which consits of the first 4 tracks: "Fur Immer", "Spitzenwualitat", "Gedenkminute", and "Lila Engel" (as of this writing Amazon's tracklisting is incorrect) . This is the heart of the album, with the driving "Fur Immer" connecting the dots between Kraftwerk's motor beats with alternative rock riffing.  "Lila Engel"  pounds agressively like there's no tomorrow, years before it became fashionable in punk music.  Did I mention this music was originally released in '73? Awesome!  The second half consits of the remaining 7 tracks which, reportedly due to budget restraints, were recorded with minimal material. The band's solution was to drag or speed up pieces of their own music in various configurations using a turntable (complete with needle drops and vinyl scraping). The woozy "Cassetto" feeds music through a dying cassette player until its last, wretched gasp. This section of NEU! 2 is remixing in its most primitive form. Although it's an amusing idea to recycle pre-existing material in this fashion, the approach wears itself thin quite early, and hardly justifies any repeat listens.    I would say that NEU! 2 is second best behind the band's self-titled debut (Rating: 5 stars), and tied with their 3rd and final(?) effort NEU! 75, where NEU! were beginning to sound too self-conscious, IMHO.  NEU!'s music has become better with age and surpasses any music out here that is being labeled "alternative" these days.  It's good enough for Tarantino, and it's good enough for you! BUY IT!  Favorite tracks:  "Fur Immer", "Lila Engel",  "Super"  Final Rating: 3.5 out of 5.+music
One of the most original and best albums in the last 10 years+P+This album is without any doubt one of the most original CDs I have ever heard. The success in which Kearney mixes musical styles is astounding. What makes this album so enjoyable besides the catchy melodies, good lyrics and his voice is the top notch production given to each of the tracks. There is so much here that one most listen to the album a good 3 or 4 times before you start to truly appreciate the depth of this work.+music
Beautiful Music+P+The Music of Aaron Copleand is timeless and purely Amerian.  Thus, it is the best choice to be in a movie about basketball, one of America's favorite sports.  This collection of Aaron Copland's music introduced me to  this great composer and is a perfect start for new classical listeners.   SUperb+music
Left Out Cal!!?!?!?!?!?!?!+N+Considering the fact that the University of California - Berkeley boasts the largest repetoire {sp?} of school songs of ANY university in the country makes the fact that this compilation has not included ANY of them problematic at the very least.  Big C (or Sons of Westwood to you theiving baby bears out there) - Fight for California - Sons of California - Stanford Jonah - Golden Bear - Make Way for the Bear - Roll On - Cal Band March - California Triumph - Palms of Victory - California Indian Song - California Marching Song - One More River - All Hail - Hail to California - California, We're For You --  Take your pick - they are all fantastic - and I think I forgot a few...  To leave out Cal is either shoddy work or bad temperment.  Go Bears - Beat the Cougars+music
Yawn+N+If you are looking for the fiery songs we all hear on Saturdays throughout the fall, keep looking. The song selection also dates this album. Many of today's power houses are excluded in favor of those who saw their days of glory before my lifetime. It is also insulting to see the Iowa Fight Song credited to Iowa State+music
Better with age...+P+Supergrass is one of the best bands active today.  Their sound is both retro and current.  Not only can they make catchy music, but their musicianship is second to none.  That said, this release took a few listens to grow on me, but it has certainly done that.  Each time it takes its place in my car's CD player, it stays there for weeks at a time.  I feel this is one of their better releases, and I anxiously await the next..+music
A rocking medley of traditional folk+P+Tempest expertly infuses ballads and reels with rock, giving traditional folk music a new energy as well as contributing some original pieces that are equally timeless. I like this album even better than their last (titled &quot;Balance&quot;). Though each track is distinct and stands well on its own, they all complement one another and play almost seamlessly as a whole. Maybe I'm partial since I first heard Tempest live as the current ensemble of musicians, but I think newcomer violinist Sue Draheim's harmony vocals add a sweet texture the previous album did not have. Then again, there's just something about the female voice in general that gives authenticity to the emotional layer in folk ballads. At any rate, having seen some of Tempest's live performances, I can attest that all of its current members are highly talented and treat the craft of blending folk and rock with a professionalism that is entirely trustworthy. Listening to this album is like gathering around a home fire and being entertained by a captivating storyteller. Definitely worth hearing...again and again+music
hardly representative of the 90s+N+has anyone else noticed that there isnt a single nirvana song? of all of the bands of the 90s, nirvana was undoubtedly one of the more luminary bands. and yet they appear nowhere on this compilation. instead, we are treated to the worst of the consumerist, disposable pop trash the 90s had to offer. a retrospective album should do more to cover the diverse styles of music that were prevalent at this time, but this album falls short in every aspect.+music
This compilation is so wrong+N+I loved the 90's. Some great things happened to me in the 90's and I have tons of great memories, none of which are associated with anything about this compilation. To be fair, I'm OK with 3, maybe 4 of the songs. Tubthumping and Shine I can deal with. The former was kind of good but severely overplayed for and by the worst kind of people. The latter is not a good song but somehow it has grown on me, plus I think it's funny that the guitar part is stolen directly from the Kinks' &quot;Lola&quot;. I've always thought I'm Too Sexy was funny, bad but funny. And the En Vogue song is actually kind of good, but don't tell anyone I said that. The rest of the album? Crap of the crappiest crap caliber. The Macarena? Mambo no. 5? Whoomp there it is? Those songs should never have even seen the light of day. And O.P.P. was possibly the worst thing about the 90's. Plus does anybody really need to OWN the theme from friends? Why why WHY????!!!!! The only attrocity this CD is missing is that awful Choo Choo Train song. Please make this one go away quickly+music
Winged and soaring to the celestial+P+I see Wynton Marsalis mesmerized, James Brown befuddled, Aretha astounded, Mariah mortified, Beyonce blushing, Eric Clapton clapping, and Pelham Goodard (Peegee) gasping. Ahhh yes! The seven-layer salad of song (jazz-funk-soul-pop-r&b-rock-calypso)...The Magic Johnson of music. My fav...TTD's Recurring Dream. I luv the metaphysical stories, Jimi Hendrix-like wa-wa guitar sound, and that cowbell sounding percussion. Mad props to We don't have...great calypso, Holding on to you, Supermodel Sandwich w/cheese...so, so funky, as well as all the others. It's too bad many slept on this work of art. But many slept on Ray Charles until just recently. Although the album title doesn't indicate what the song or album is about, nevertheless, it is less than flattering. No other complaints though. Definitely an album for the thinking person and introspective. I genuflect out of courtesy and respect.+music
A Brilliant Debut Album, From A Brilliant Singer/Songwriter!+P+Don't let a few bad reviews fool you! This is easily one of the best albums out there! There's not a bad song in the bunch! And Courtney Jaye is easily one of best and most original singer/songwriters around also! And she's worked with some of the best in the business to create this musical masterpiece! This is nothing like the average pop music you hear, It has more of a hawaiian sound on some songs, I noticed that the first time i heard it! She calls it rootsy/exotic/alt/pop on her myspace page! That's one of the things i like most about the album! Plus the songs are all so fun, catchy, and dreamy, and she has such a great singing voice, i just can't get enough of it! And there's something for everyone to like! I really love all of the songs so much! But if i had to pick any favorites probably" Time For Goodbye" "This Is The Day" "Love me" and "Hanalei Road" to name a few! So please buy this album and listen to the whole thing, with an open mind, and listen more than once! If you're anything like me and really like great music that's different than the usual dull boring music you're used to hearing, I know you'll love it as much as i do! Courtney Jaye is one very talented artist that has real staying power! She's already finished her next album so that's proof of that! And from what i've heard of it, it's great also! I know she certainly has a life long fan in me!    +music
Is it me..?+N+I bought this album because I am always interested in finding great new artists and music.  I love Sarah McLachlan, Emm Gryner, Indigo Girls, Jem-- things along that line.  So I thought I would love Courtney Jaye.  But I just can't.  I think it's terribly simplistic, predictable and unimaginable.  I like her voice, but combined with the simple lyrics, unoriginal themes and repetitive tunes, I just have to turn her off after a couple songs.  I tried to be open-minded (I even like some Kelly Clarkson and Natalie Imbruglia songs) but I don't hear the talent+music
One of those shows+N+That title probably gives the wrong impression. But there are a few different types of musicals. The ones that you have to see to understand, the ones you can just listen to and get the jist of it, and then those that some one has to explain it to you after you've seen and listened to it. This show is one that you have to see. I haven't seen the show, so this revue is based soley on my impression after listening to it, and I wasnt really entertained. A good bit of the music is tap dancing, and that just inst as thrilling as it would be if you were seeing it. So, know that a good bit of what you will be listening is tap dancing. The actual singing has some good moments. Its also has some extremly grating moments, which may have been for effect in the show, but not pleasent to listen to. I would definitly listen to samples of as many songs as you can before you decide to buy this one. Collectors should get it just because they collect, but others should probably not by this one blindly. If your getting a gift for someone who likes "musicals" this wouldnt be one to get. Fav song: "Lynching Blues"+music
Journey - 'Trial By Fire' (Sony)+N+Apparently,their last work with frontman Steve Perry and quite the let down.'Trial...' was the band's '96 comeback attempt,but if I remember correctly this CD was a stiff from the get-go.I tried SO hard to get into this fifteen track disc,but even with a duration of 68 minutes,I just couldn't.The songs don't completely suck,they just don't appear to have much life.Fantastic cover,don't you agree?If you're an old school Journey fan,I encourage you to check out their new 2005 release,'Generations' with vocalist Steve Augeri,who's been with the band for awhile now.That CD is surprisingly good,as I'd give it 3 1/2,maybe 4 stars.Keep in mind that guitarist Neal Schon is their 'key' player+music
Life is Hard, and then you die+N+As the fantastic song title above indicates, life IS hard, and it's been hard on Johnny Winter. It is definitely beginning to show. I play guitar and sing, too, and an arrhythmic heart keeps me off stage a lot. What a drag. Well, I hear Johnny has a few health issues, and I only mentioned my own in order to be able to say that he sounds on this album a little like I feel, sometimes. His voice has weakened quite a bit, and thinned out, but as with the change in Bob Dylan's voice, he actually sounds more musical, sweeter, now, than before. So the burning glory is gone, and the blistering solos are replaced with very carefully phrased and finished riffs. And, yes, a little lacking in energy at some points. The Monkey Song is almost too skanky to be believed. Hell, Johnny, they're all shaved on the internet these days anyway, and that's probably as far as some lame old guy like you gets, right? Sorry. This guy, doing Rock& Roll hootchie-Koo with Rick Derringer back in 1970, could blow walls down. I guess this is the blues+music
Broke Boy (2 and 1/2 stars)+N+I'll state the obvious. Rich Boy's southern twang is so thick that its hard to understand what he is saying sometimes. This album has more bad tracks than good tracks so let me focus on the good then the bad. Standout Tracks: Throw Some Ds is a catchy first single that I didnt like at first and the remix with Andre 3000(he had the best verse on here), Nelly, Murphy Lee, The Game is a lot better than the original. Boy Looka Here is an alright second single plus I like how the beat breaks down. And I Love You had potential to be a great track till Pastor Troy delivers a crappy verse on it but Big Boi held it down on here. Lost Girls and Ghetto Rich(featuring John Legend) are two tracks that are worth hearing plus any song of substance I'll give credit for. Filler: Rich Boy pulls a Rick Ross and has way too many chick songs on here like What It Do, Good Things, Touch That A**(the worst out of all of them) and On The Regular. Role Models is weak and so is the fillerific Hustla Balla Gangsta Mack and Gangsta. Get To Poppin has to be the worst plus I've heard Pitbull spit over that same horrible beat(and that track sucked too). Bottom Line: 6 good songs are a good enough reason to skip this album. Yeah it might have some catchy cuts but the album is packed to the rim with skip material.+music
GARBAGE+N+By far one of the worse albums 2 come out the south since,  well since I can remember, GARBAGE,  on the highest level, I actually took the CD back to Best Buy, walked up to customer service and told them they can have it back and keep the money. If u are trying to be Rich, U need to come up with a better game plan cause u sure didnt put effort in this peice of work. U want to be a Rich Boy, I want to be a Rich MAN, Now how Rich is that+music
Where is the ICE CUBE I know ?+N+What happened ?  Ice Cube is my favorite rapper of all time!  For anyone else this would have been 3 stars, but this is a real disappointment to me persoanlly.  If you like the older HARD hitting Ice Cube and NWA I would try one of his earlier releases.  Who knows though... I love plenty of CDs that I hated at first+music
This Album Blows Arse Cheeks+N+I'm a huge fan of the Beatles. I'm also a huge fan of the modern artists that did this album. ..and the Backbeat movie was ok too. So I figure, how can I go wrong. I'll buy the record.   Well simply put, the album sounds like a bunch of generic poo.   Why in the world did they have Thurston Moore on here?  Hmm, we need somebody to stand there and strum basic chords .. let's bring in someone who normally plays sound-effects guitar with magnets and drumsticks.     Obviously the point was to put together a modern supergroup (underground supergroup anyway) to cover a supergroup.  Problem = it doesn't sound like The Beatles OR like these familiar modern artists. It just falls somewhere boringly inbetween, though that might be exactly what some people would want.  DAVE GROHL CANNOT SING. Yeah that's right I said it. Gumby was a better rockstar then this guy. ..well i mean that sarcastically but thinking about it, Gumby was actually a really cool rockstar. But back on topic, Dave Grohl needs to stick to things he's good at like chewing gum, beating the snot out of drum-sets, and growing big sweaty moustaches.   I've heard cardboard boxes blowing in the wind that sounded more exciting then this record.   If Amazon.com had the feature, I'd give it a negative star just for having the guy from Soul Asylum on it.  +music
Not As Good As 'Vital Signs'+P+Almost a carbon copy of it's predecessor, 'Vital Signs'. Unlike 'Vital Signs', which was virtually flawless, this one has some flaws.  This follow-up has less memorable songs, cheesier lyrics, and drags a little bit more.  Still, a good overall effort nonetheless.  The highlight is obviously 'Is This Love', which reached as high as #9 on the bilboard charts.  Overall, same mid-80's power-ballad formula as 'Vital Signs', which is never a bad thing, is it+music
Plush is real comfort+P+So you wanna have music on that provides some real audio comfort, music that has some very cool rhythms, music that is well-orchestrated and textured, well search no more for Plush delivers on all levels, it is a lovely mix of music in the so-called "downtempo" vein but it is really above and beyond just the latest kind of thing, instead it is a combination of some very sexy music that exemplifies the best in current trends in music! I found it to be wonderful for playtime and my lover agreed with some stunning sonic cues to me as the disc unwound the first time we had it on as we got it on! It is certainly a great disc for the romantically inclined although it is good enough to be just darn good without having to occupy anything specific by way of description since it rolls easily all the way from the very cool to the beautifully hot. I could wax on about my fave tracks but I actually love them all, it is a well put together set and has that magical sort of flow from track to track. You should try it on for love, don't even say a word to your sweetie, just put forward your best kiss and let the disc play, Plush indeed+music
As boring as the rest of  his opus+N+I consider Golijov the Britanny Spears of new music. He re-hashes what others have done,albeit with less originality than Britanny, all the while making me nod off+music
Swanky Panky+N+It has moments of funny, but overall only good for one or two plays.  Like Howard Sterns said, good idea but I don't know if I could sit and listen to it+music
A great place to start+P+Prefab Sprout, a band that just ages very well.  Thomas Dolby's footprints are all over this recording.  While this CD lacks "Wild Horses", it contains just about every song any fan could wish for.  Hands down, it beats the Life of Surprises compilation with its inclusions of "Lions in My Own Garden"  and other material from Swoon, as well as such gems such as "The Golden Calf" (a personal favorite of mine) off From Langley Park to Memphis as well as the wonderful "Bonny" from Steve McQueen/Two Wheels Good.  I think I could listen to this CD for weeks on end and never tire of such greats as "Life of Suprises", "The Sound Of Crying", "Carnival 2000", "Appetite" and so many others.  Yes, you could go buy all the Sprout's stuff (which I recommend highly).  Still, this is a great way to savor one of the most wonderful bands out there.+music
The Sixth Dimension+P+You'll probably recognize GRAZING IN THE GRASS as the backround music from that TV commercial with the Chinese-American lady from the View.   I forget whether its for khakis or golf, and I most certainly don't watch the View,  but this is great music.   - - You might remember Issac Hayes making fun of  the million mile an hour &quot;I can dig it&quot; conjugations in &quot;I'm  Gonna Get You Sucka&quot;  - -My point is, they're songs like KUNG FU  FIGHTING and a lot of tunes in those GAP commercials... you may not have  actually bought the album or even know the words (personally, I have a  sealed copy of Kung Fu), but if you're a certain age, you you're bound to  remember them or perk up when you hear them.  I tend to think of this group  as kind of a slightly more soulful take off on the Fifth Dimension.  When  I'm in the mood I like both groups.   They are cheery yet soulful at the  same time.   While Grazing was their big hit, I'd have to say the winner  for me is LOVE OR LET ME BE LONELY...  especially the way it starts out all  slow and dramatic then goes into that brassy uptempo part.   - - Anyway,  these songs make great listening (and sometimes backround music) for the  key of life.   For sure they were definitely the &quot;Have a Nice  Day/*smile*&quot; side of the '70s.   I would definitely reccomend  exploring them+music
Loved it!+P+I absolutely love this CD. I bought it when it first came out, and I used to listen to it everyday, a few times a day. But recently I found my CD and it was CRACKED! Anyhow , I'm about to buy it again. But I wanted to let everybody know that this CD is definetly hot, you don't have to skip any songs because they all are good+music
For at  least trying+N+But they tried WAY TO HARD to supercede Front Page News and to make it MORE SUCCESSFUL. Failed at both attempts!  This was a big slump period for the band at this point in time.  In fact most of these songs when performed live, HAD the intense fire, these studio versions lacked. 'Way of the World' scorched everytime I heard it live, but on No Smoke Without Fire, well it was a smouldering flicker.  This was one of their biggest letdowns with Laurie Wisefield on second guitar.  The live tracks included here (Lorelei) are nice but are hardly indicative of what 'couldve been', if that energy was put to better use for this project+music
A Great Vocalist; A Lousy Recording+N+My fellow reviewers have one of two things happening:  (1) they received different discs than I, or (2) they have been smoking some very serious stuff.   The average review is five stars?   I can give it only one which is a major disappointment!   Why?   Although the title of the CD is accurate, the quality of the disk is perfectly terrible.   A number of tracks reproduce horribly and No. 2 (There I Go) is particularly bad.   One wonders why the folks that make thse recordings can't take the time to make certain that the customer gets a decent recording for his or her money.  If original master recordings need to be cleaned up in order to give the listener a fair shake then this needs to be done.   This is a perfectly wonderful assortment of Vaughn Monroe's recordings.  It is a perfectly terrible recording of them+music
A classic, blues or otherwise+P+Anyone who dismisses blues music as being sad and depressing and whiny should listen to this album. Sure, B.B. King sings about heartbreak and lost love in many of the songs, but he does so in such a way that it is uplifting, maybe just because you can relate to it and say "oh, that cat knows what I'm feeling". That, right there, is why this record is timeless. All of the songs, with the possible exception of "Help the Poor", are knockouts. This being a live album of course, the audience is absolutely IN LOVE with B.B. and the band, and people often shout out things like "Play it all night!" and "Tell it, B.B.!" If this were a studio album, it would not be nearly as good. The advantage of hearing blues live is that you get to hear a whole different atmosphere- people screaming, clapping, going wild for the sweet sound of Lucille. Which reminds me, not only is the guitar on this album fantastic, but also B.B.'s vocals are downright amazing! They range from a deep gravely tone to a sweet falsetto, and are some of the best blues vocals ever put to tape. If you do not own this, get it, just to hear classics like "Sweet Little Angel", "Worry Worry", "How Blue Can You Get", and "You Upset Me Baby". An absolute must-have+music
Great+P+It's awesome that someone could give you the feeling you get when you hear a song for the first time all over again with the same songs. This album is just great.You get used to &quot;Frio&quot; , then you get the same songs you love in english and it works wonderfully.I could not believe my ears the first time. This is an excellent piece of art and it should be in your collection+music
Very atmospheric soundtrack with some heavier moments +P+This 1972 soundtrack for the Barbet Schroeder film "La Vallee" was recorded during two, one-week sessions, between which a tour of Japan was sandwiched.  Interestingly, the album works as a cohesive whole, in spite of the short recording time, and the "dry" production (especially on Nick Mason's drums) lends the album a very tight feel.  It has been written that Obscured by Clouds is the last true group effort and I pretty much agree.  The album also finds the band poised on the cusp of massive, global superstardom, which would become fully realized with the mega-smash, mega-million selling album The Dark Side of the Moon (1973).  Lyrically, Roger Waters begins to reflect on issues that he would develop further, including his war-victim father (Free Four) and Dave Gilmour refers to science fiction with Childhoods End, which is the title of Arthur C. Clarke's classic from the genre.  I guess it is worth noting that Childhood's End was recorded without the final verse and that Roger would write all lyrics for the group following this album, thus "relieving" Dave of this responsibility.  Dave's vocals are also excellent and he really comes across as a confident singer.  His guitar playing is also in top flight too.  In addition to tracks with lyrics, there are quite a few instrumentals as well.  Musically, I think Pink Floyd was in fine form on this album.  My favorite cuts include the atmospheric, VCS3 synthesizer heavy instrumental tracks Obscured by Clouds, Mudmen, and Absolutely Curtains (loads of Rick Wright's sustained Hammond organ), along with the heavy instrumental When You're In.  Burning Bridges, Wot's...uh the Deal, and Stay are also superb and feature the trademark drifting and spacey Floyd sound.  At the opposite end of the spectrum is the thunderous The Gold It's in the..., which reminds me somewhat of the bone-crushing Nile Song (from More, 1969).  Free Four is the only bouncy and lighthearted track on the album, which stands in stark contrast with Water's dark subject matter - the ruminations of someone on their deathbed.  With respect to this 1994 remaster it is just OK and features good sound quality, images from the film, and all lyrics.  All in all, this excellent album is a personal favorite and is very highly recommended along with Atom Heart Mother (1970), Meddle (1971), Wish You Were Here (1975), and Animals (1977).+music
Possibly Yanni's best original release+P+Most of Yanni's releases before this CD were compilations of earlier works.  This was his first all new work in quite a while.  And I still consider it his best work to date.  This CD contains most of the pieces used in his &quot;Live at the Acropolis&quot;.  The &quot;Live&quot; CD and Video have a better performance of these pieces however, because of the added instrumentation.  But in the realm of his non-live recordings, this is his best+music
hip music 101+P+"Ocean's Eleven" is one of those few movie soundtracks worth having. The disc features an eclectic blend of music with the unifying theme of hipness. The CD is as cool as the movie. The hit is of course 'A Little Less Conversation' which became the theme song to the NBC show "Las Vegas." The exposure eventually dethroned 'Viva Las Vegas' as the city's choice Elvis tune. Very few soundtracks have made such an impact. Under the general umbrella of jazz, the disc features lounge, acid jazz, big band and even orchestral music. It has a choice blend of swaggering vintage sounds and sophisticated modern music. At the same time, the album finds balance between time tested classics and original music created for the Ocean's Eleven project. The disc will have high appeal to instrumental enthusiasts. While the soundtrack would be stronger without some of the film's dialogue, such a product wouldn't be difficult to create in the day and age of CD-R burners. "Ocean's Eleven" is a hip journey worth taking.+music
boring! not worth it+N+i regret buying this cd even though it just a buck i didn't like it at all the girl or whatever she is don't know how to sing at all sounds like she is whinning don't buy it i know what i am saying i am a trip hop fan and check out soma sonic /future thats real musi+music
A CD I tried to sell and no one would buy+N+This cd is horrible. It starts of with a couple catchy pops songs that Carson Daily liked then all the sudden, they bust out some rap. Canadians can't rap, I DEMAND JUSTICE!!!+music
No Funkin' Around+P+Funk, in its purest form, is hard to come by these days. That's because we don't have the kind of wreckless visionaries that the 70s had, like Dr. John and George Clinton. These guys were so far gone into their music that they bordered on being parodies of themselves, and somehow that translated into the kind of raw and unprecedented energy that makes their music so saturated in what one would ideally define as 'funky'. Take Dr. John: the dude is basically the white George Clinton, with his crazy head dresses and honky tonk muppet voice. Put him in front of a piano, get the Meters to lay down the tightest funk grooves you've ever heard, and add producer Alain Toussaint's canjun roots and you've got an exceptionally enjoyable album in "In The Right Place". The music is uplifting and listenable; The Meters take the house down with some thick bass riffs, brilliantly arranged horns and tight-as-hell percussions. Dr. John wails like a drunken canjun cartoon character, which is such an endearing and appropriate compliment to this musical experience that you will not know how to listen to this kind of funk without a voice as original and funky as this.  While the entire album provides a consistent line-up of quality jams, the two stand-outs that have become two of Dr. John's greatest hits are "Right Place, Wrong Time" and "Such A Night". "Right Place, Wrong Time" would fill any dance floor with its danceability factor, while "Such A Night" is a kind of honky tonk interpretation of a faster-paced soul ballad, with great backing vocals and a nostalgic, Bugsy Malone-sounding keys section.  This album is a must-have for any self-respecting fan of the funk. Dr. John is a true pioneer in the genre and, while most of his work is worth owning, this is nonetheless one of his best albums to prove it+music
No justice here+N+EWF is perhaps the greatest band of our time.  They had the best songs for a 20 year span and yet the record companies continue to put together greatest hit packages on one cd.  How the heck can you have an EWF greatest  hits on one cd?  Impossible.  Hey record company, while you're at it, do  the Beatles, Elvis, Stevie and Frank too+music
uggggg+N+not good at all!!!! while watching the movie i thought it sounded like a great soundtrack... but i think they must have put all the bad songs on i+music
Funniest thing I have ever encountered music-wise+N+This band is the funniest thing I have ever seen. Go to their website, www.mightyrhapsody.com here you will find why they are so damn funny. These guys actually believe they are dragon slayers! I can't stop laughing at this band! Say hello to Medieval Metal+music
BEWARE - SUPER AUDIO CD Format Does Not Play!!!+N+With great anticipation, I purchased this CD but it came in some obscure "Super Audio CD" format by Sony. It is unplayable on my CD player and unreadable on my laptop. The Amazon product description does not designate this. Bummer. Now I have to go through some return/replace hassle+music
Mushroomhead is by far my favorite band of all-time+P+I first saw this album in the store and I had never heard of this band before and I thought they looked awesome on the front cover so I took a chance and bought the CD. When I got it home and listened to it for the first time I immediately fell in love with the songs Solitaire Unraveling, These Filthy Hands, Never Let It Go, The Wrist, The New Cult King, and Too Much Nothing. I love how they make 8 band members work so uniquely and the two vocalists just put a whole other aspect to their music and separates them from many other bands. I saw the Solitaire Unraveling video on Headbangers Ball and I think it is so awesome and shows just how much emotion there is in their music. I would recommend this album to anybody who wants to listen to and a unique and talented band+music
Not many lullabyes in Spanish+N+As others have noted, this turns out to be only a handful of lullabyes in Spanish sung by Maria Del Rey, plus nursery rhymes spoken by children and men (not very good for putting a baby to sleep), plus the whole thing repeated in English.  In addition, I had been looking for traditional Latin American pieces and apparently all of these are contemporary.  Don't waste your money...I'm planning on giving my copy away if I can figure out someone I know who could actually use it+music
Very smooth+P+Although I usually preffer more energetic D&B this album really caught me by surprise. The beats are so precise and well executed. I really enjoyed the amount of control that Photek had over the music. Don't go in thinking this will be dieselboy or DJ DB because it's not. It's an entirely different beast. It's a bit more along the lines of Polygon Window mixed with Amon Tobin's walls of sound. It's a really great album to relax and read to. Some of the tracks can be a bit stale but most of them are pretty great, especially track one (it's my fav)+music
terrible+N+to try and re create NWA with the west coast best is a good idea but it cant be done. The sound of NWA was so raw loud and straight ghetto that this remake serves as a sorry re mak+music
not as good as the original+N+If you have listened to the original cd you will find this one to be  terrible. It can never be as good as the original.  Also Snoop Dogg screwes  up in Gangsta Gangst+music
Judy is great but the Elektra CD is awful+N+I was stunned by how bad this CD sounds.  I'm no expert, so I can't give you a precise description with proper terminology.  Suffice it to say it's a bad job of transferring the recordings to CD.  I later bought the Gold version, and the difference is like night and day.  Judy Collin's voice is too wonderful to let this awful CD prevent you from really hearing her.  The Gold version is worth the extra money+music
Must have for any fan+P+Any moderate fan of The Scarlett Pimpernel, musical, book or movie(s) should own this cd. I absolutely love the songs "Believe" and "Vivez" which are not on the Encore cd, and this disk is worth owning for them alone. I'm not crazy about Chauvlin's voice on this disk, which is a bit pinched and his phrasing is awkward at times. For great Chauvlin tracks (like Where's the Girl) you definatly need to buy the Encore cd. Christine Andreas's renditions of "Only Love" and "You Are My Home" are also more dramatic and truely broadway versions on this disk whereas on the Encore disk these are pop-versions sung by people who were not in the show.+music
One of my favorite albums of all time.  She is an amazing songwriter.  +P+Not only is Pink an amazing singer, but her lyrics are soo deep and personal.  I love people who write about the sad times because a lot of people needs to hear something they can relate to.   Family Potrait speaks to a lot of people, including my brother, who overhead the song and keeps requesting me to replay track 7.   The whole album is a work of art so it's hard to choose, but if I had to choose, my favorites are Don't let me get me, Just Like a Pill, Family Potrait and Lonely Girl.  Pink's voice is soo raw and real that you can actually feel the pain in her voice.  Once you listen to this album, you will want hear more.   So I will go ahead and let you know that her third album is Try This and her fourth, which is her best thus far is "I'm Not Dead".  So please give this album a chance.  Pink is a real artist and she will be around for a long time because she is true to herself.    +music
Great music+P+I first heard this album on a trip to Ireland.  The women artists on this album epitomize the soul of a beautiful land--the cd quality is awesome--I recommend to all who want to expand their tastes+music
One of the classic Jazz CD/albums of all time+P+I agree with the previous reviewer, cool jazz?  John Lewis and Milt Jackson  defined cool jazz.  Much better than that crap now that I call "Smoove Jazz".  This CD evokes memories of the Music Inn and Tanglewood in the 50s.  The namesake of this CD is the song Django, a tribute to the late great Django Reinhardt.  This is a must for any jazz enthusiasts collection+music
Fantastic musicians, wonderful  music+P+Doc Watson is great, and so is Clarence Ashley. This is music worth listening to. Often+music
One of the Best Rap Albums of the Year+P+The Further Adventures of Lord Quas is the Trout Mask Replica of rap.  Madlib, much like Captain Beefheart, has a unique style that is hard to penetrate and hard to pin down.  The songs on this album aren't really songs per se, they are more like random clips and odd ball samples with the occasional spattering of rhyme thrown in.  The album is dizzying to listen to.  Their must be 50 or 60 little mini skits, song fragments, and other oddities sprinkled through the album.  All this combines to make one of the best and innovative rap albums to come down the pipe this year.  Madlib/Quasimoto has created an innovative and unique production style that he created with the first Quasimoto album the Unseen, continued with the excellent Madvillian record, and continues to refine with this production.  Overall I think that his production sounds more complete on this record than on Madvillian.  What makes this a weaker release than Madvillian is the quality of lyrics and the MC involved.  Quasimoto is not as good as MF Doom.  Quasimoto seems to be riffing on Doom's style throughout, and his voice can get kind of irritating.  He sounds like Eminem on helium and without all the homophobic gay bashing.  It's an interesting trick, kind of like what Prince did on If I Was Your Girlfriend, but extended for a whole album.  His style can be grating though.    Overall, The Further Adventures of Lord Quas is a good album that fans of off-kilter alternative rap will love.  If you like Dr. Octagon, MF Doom, Peanut Butter Wolf, or Aesop Rock, then you'll enjoy this.  You want to be patient with it though, Madlib's style is like peeling an onion, you need to remove some of the outer layers before you can get the full effect of it. +music
An artist in flux+N+Precious is an interesting document of a band in flux, searching for a sound. Gnecco's voice is in fine form, but on only his second record, he is repeating himself. The wonderful falsetto is heard hitting the same notes over and over again, which begs the question, is there true vocal range here, or a couple of parlor trick notes? We will not be sure until we hear more form OURS. When not in falsetto, Gnecco is developing a kind of warble that will alienate many listeners who prefer a cleaner vocal delivery. In addition, the chemistry between the band seems off, making the album sound incohesive or even over-dubbed, The guitar lines which Milone and Gnecco intend to create tension which boils over to melodic changes, seem dissonant and unneccessary. This music would be better served by simpler production. Ethan Johns could probably stand to play a bit more drums - it almost seems like he is deliberately restraining himself in the context of music that isn't sure weather it's hard rock or singer-songwriter stuff. &quot;Leaves&quot; is the lone high spot for this album, with its catchy Beatles meets U2 progression. The rest of the album, as typified by &quot;Kill the Band&quot; lacks cohesion, hooks, and musical identity. Instead of just letting the songs flow and write themselves, it seems like Gnecco is forcing things and deliberately trying to be complex with concepts that are essentially simple. Lyrically, Gneeco could use some help, as he is repeating rhymes, and syllabic patterns all over the place. From a standpoint of lyical meaning, the album is pretty much the standard emo / alt rock / depressed vibe. Nothing new here. Maybe just a sophomore jinx. stay tuned+music
why????+N+i am an honestly big fan of beyonce. i have both of her cds and have always loved destiny's child. i even love her new song "beautiful liar". but i think that it is illogical for her to re-release this album, escpecially since releasing it in april defeats the purpose of naming the album "Bday" because her birthday is in september. but still, i can't help but love her new song. and i think that she did a great job with shakira. it is an unlikely collabo between two of the most successful artists of the decade, which makes it a great song. but shakira totally steals the spotlight with her stronger voice. i think this track should belong to shakira and she could use it as one of her tracks for her next album+music
Dark? Sad? Difficult listening?  I dunno about all that...+P+Throughout the reviews for "Bone Machine", you'll see warnings that this music is harrowing, obsessed with death, "not the place to begin with Tom Waits."  Pshaw.  This album makes me grin ear-to-ear, all the way through.  This one contains some of Tom's most lovely ballads: "Who Are You", and the amazing "A Little Rain".  It has some of his funniest lyrics: "Murder in the Red Barn" comes to mind.     "Cause there's nothin' strange About an axe with bloodstains in the barn  There's always some killin' You got to do around the farm"  The poetry on "Bone Machine" is truly (to use an overused phrase), mind-blowing.  Hell, I might even go to church if they sang honest songs about mortality like the chillingly beautiful "Dirt in the Ground"!  "The Ocean Doesn't Want Me" is his best spoken word piece ever.  "Jesus Gonna Be Here" just flat rocks out.     Be clear about this: "Bone Machine" is not background music: it demands attention.  But the bottom line: be not afraid.  Strap on the headphones, pour a tall glass, and take the ride. +music
Not as good as it shoulda, coulda been...+N+I know that it takes talent to make music, and I hate to criticize any musicians because I certainly couldn't do it, but this CD was just not that good. There are some cool beats, but they're pretty forgettable. Lyrics in electronic music aren't always deep or anything, but in some cases, I think she actually was trying to make a &quot;real song&quot;, so it was kind of sad. Her vocals are Madonna-esque, without the smooth production. Maybe she just didn't quite live up to the hype. I'm beginning to think that most female djs &quot;make it&quot; just because of the novelty of female djs. There was nothing to HATE, but there certainly wasn't anything to love, either+music
Ummmm....sorry, this one isn't very good.+N+Yeah, i bought this CD because i heard she is one of the better Drum N' Bass DJs....and she's really damn cute.  Problem is...this CD isn't very good at all.  Trying to go too main stream popish, some of the lyrics are laughable, there isn't a single song on this CD that would make it into one of my sets.  I'm sure she's a very good DJ, but someone led her down the wrong road this time+music
A blissful album of idiot glee+P+Yeah its true folks the Amazon reviewer was absolutely correct in that the lyrics are simply something to hang the pretty melodies on and the music is nowhere near as sophisticated as Blur would later write, but... and its a big but. Blur never again made an album this unabashedly joyful and ecstatic again. Mix great melodies, dumb dumb simple but very singable lyrics, lovely vocal harmonies strapped on top of a driving guitar with compelling and dancable rhythms and you have this rolling explosion of brit-pop bliss. Sometimes an album doesn't have to mean anything to be good+music
Sorry, this is weak.+N+I first heard Nadia Ali on a few tracks from Global Underground 29 - Sharam/Dubai (which I seriously recommend) which immediately made her my new favorite singer - so I bought this with great expectations, only to be really dissapointed. I can't imagine why she's working with this guy - sorry, he's a hack - these tracks sound like leftovers from Kylie Minogue's trash, and yes, I could do better. Avoid this at all costs & hope Nadia finds somebody with talent to work with ... yawn+music
A good value, and a great place to start+P+I was only casually aquainted with Mary Chapin Carpenter's music before picking up this album.  The hits I knew were all here, and so was a lot more material I have come to love as well.  I was a bit leery that &quot;Down at the Twist and Shout&quot; was a live version from the Super Bowl; this song was the primary reason I wanted a MCC album, and I was concerned a live version recorded in a stadium during the Super Bowl might be of inferior recording quality.  But I needn't have worried, the sound is great, and the performance is energetic and fun, with a verse in Creole thrown in for good measure.  &quot;This Shirt&quot; is probably my favorite track I was unfamiliar with, but the entire album is quality; there are very few 17-track albums by any artist where I can say I enjoyed every song.  I now look forward to exploring her original albums.  I highly recommend this album to anyone looking for an introduction to this great artist+music
DOnt' even bother+N+The remix sucks.  DOn't even buy the whole remixes on iTunes, they really are bad.  I will write reviews for their other remixes.  Nerd once again strikes out with another _________ comment.  The title is the NATO Phoetic alphabet, your stupid piece of _____.  Once again, you have no idea what you are talking about.  Becuase your stupid.  Tell me, could you write a song like this?    Your respone will be:  No, but It's stupid anyway! or, YES!  No, no you couldn't.  _____ off, your reasons on your pathetic reivew for Hooray shows how much of a dumbarse you are.  THe people who understand the jokes will know how stupid the BHG haters are+music
I thought they were being picky, but...+N+I have always loved Boz and everything he has produced so far.  So, when I read the reviews in preparation to purchase this album, I shook my head and said to myself, "Some people are just way too picky!  How bad could the drums be?"  Well, I found out.  The drum track in this album ranges from "mildly irritating" to "AAARRRRGGGHHHHH! Somebody shoot the drummer, please!"  The constant brushes on the cymbals on ALMOST EVERY SONG creates a background noise that makes you feel like you're listening to a radio station that isn't quite tuned in to the proper frequency.  I was SO disappointed, because Boz does such a beautiful job singing these lovely songs.  I can't make myself enjoy them, however, because I can't get my focus off of that freakin' drum noise!  So, if you think some of the previous reviewers are just trying to be a little aurally precious, I assure you that they have put forth valid points - points with which I sadly concur.  Can somebody tell Boz to remix this thing and cut out Irritating Cymbals Guy?  Sheesh. +music
What The F**k Happened?+N+I loved Amanda's first two albums. But this? Some of the dumbest lyrics I've ever heard. This cd totally sucks. Buy her first 2  cd's, but don't touch this one!! I love her, but this cd is rotten to the core+music
Ay Carumba!  (sic)+P+Very energetic and extremely well done.  Excellent guitarists.  They really beat on those guitars+music
Not Worth the Time or Money+N+Puddle of Mudd exploded into the contemporary pop/rock scene around 2000.  This album is representative of their entire catalogue.  For those music fans who want to hear true hard rock, pick up a good copy of any early Led Zeppelin or Black Sabbath.  For anyone wanting true grunge, pick up any copy of an Alice in Chains, Soundgarden, or Nirvana album.  Puddle of Mudd shamelessly (and inaccurately) self-promotes their band/sound as both hard-rock and grunge, while living up to neither.  Since most of their fans seem to be pretty young, they've been able to pull this sham off, mainly because their audience has never been exposed to any of the aforementioned bands...and honestly has no desire to listen to any older music.  The songs on this album are extremely redundant, with little variation of riffs or overall aesthetics from one track to the next.  The lyrics are horribly compiled to offer nothing more than a vocal rhythm and subpar content.  This album is a waste of both time and money for anyone interested in listening to any worthwhile rock+music
"Lovin' Touchin' Squeezin / City of The Angels" segue-way still not fixed+N+Sony botched the 1996 re-master by not preserving the original segue-way that bridged "Lovin Touchin Squeezin" and "City of The Angels".  They have failed to correct this error with this newer, supposedly "re-masterd" version.    On the original vinyl release, "City Of The Angels" kicked in before the final chorus of "Lovin Touchin Squeezin" had completely faded to silence - presenting a similar effect that had been utilized for "Feelin' That Way/Anytime" on Infinity.  At the time, some AOR radio stations even played these two tracks together.  As completely seperate tracks on CD, the famous ending of "Lovin Touchin Squeezin" becomes clumsy as the final tones of reverb are cut off abruptly. Ultimately, it is only a couple seconds cut off (reverb echoing to silence) - But as one of Journey's signature tunes, you'd think that they'd have taken the time to get it right and preserver the original context of the release.  The original ending of 'Lovin Touchin Squeezin" (with final seconds of reverb) can be heard on the two disc collection, Essential Journey - but of course, as the set is a collection of radio songs, it does not segue into "City Of The Angels" as it originally did (and should) on Evolution.  A minor point I know.  BUT - Sony is clearly trying to honor and replicate the original release. They should take the time to check all the details to get it right.  Or - why bother+music
WHY???+P+I don't know why this is the only later "Slave" album released on Cd. Besides their first album, the others are missing in action. I guess Rhino felt that this was their most popular. But Slave had alot of "sleeper" cuts that the world should hear. I hope that they will eventually see the light of day. This band was unstoppable, and they put out some of the best music in the 80's along with One Way, Bar-kays, Con-funk-shun, and Cameo. This album is [] good!!+music
Please Stop+N+Dudes.  This is the worst ever.  You gotta be kidding me.  Life is short.  Don't do it to yourself.  Please.  Do not buy this album.  It is so cheesy it hurts.  Get some Heavenly, older Belle and Sebastian, the Beach Boys. If you like these guys then you probably like the Barenaked Ladies.  And if you like these guys and you say you hate the barenaked ladies, then you are a hipster.  My bad.  I am dumb+music
you could fit a puppy in there+N+woww oh yea um no talent. not fun to listen to, way to much unneccessary screaming. nothing goes well with anything. this is the only screamo band tht can give me a headache..sorry. the only ok song is TO the Readers. All the other ones are repetitive and just are not goo+music
Elvis Crapello+N+I don't know. I loved EC and I loved country...I even went to see him on the tour afterwards...what a waste of my precious time back then...and of my money. This is self-indulgent and badls played...I do not understand the point really. Buy some real country instead...George Jones, Johnny Cash, anything instead..+music
Can I get my money back+N+This is at best a rip-off of the tremendous talent we have come to know as Shinia Twain, COUNTRY singer.  This music may have done well and good in it's time, but Shinia is a bonafide Country Queen now and for anyone to use her name and status to capitalize on anything but the country music star we have all come to know and love is a rip-off.  Yes, this album  is a rip-off as is. Were it presented as Shinia (Eileen), circa 1990, "Disco queen" It would have been a fairer description of this music then what it was.  Can I get my money back?  3of4 El centro, CA+music
THERES NO LOMBARDO WAH WAH WAH+P+Its sinful that such a great album doesnt have a 5 star average. This is quality thrash metal right here, with a slightly refined sound to it. All the songs have blistering solos, crazy as hell riffs, and of course, Paul Bostaphs inhuman drumming, which brings me to another a point. PAUL BOSTAPH IS JUST AS GOOD AS DAVE LOMBARDO YOU F-ING RETARDS!!!!!! GET IT THROUGH YOUR F-ING SKULLS.   Sorry, I had to get that out. But seriously, just listen to the crazy intro to Killing Fields, his crazy pummeling in Dittohead, and his double bass madness in SS-3. This is Slayer, quality Slayer, and all the b-chin needs to stop. Im betting about half of you who are trashing this album havent even listened to it, like the retards reviewing Trivium and Unearth. If your like those Sepultura and Anthrax fans who refuse to move out of the 80s and early 90s, than so be it. Your loss.  As for me, my favorite tracks are Killing Fields, SS-3, Mind Control, 213, and Dittohead.  If my review has convinced you to have a positive attitude about change, get Diabolus in Musica, this, and God Hates Us All. Also get some of Pauls work with Exodus, Forbidden, and Testament if you need further proof of his excellency+music
roll it up, light it up, smoke it up +P+After watching the movie Friday, you will know that this is a must-have soundtrack. Though alot of gangsta/hardcore, some R&B or funk tracks like i heard it through the grapvine or you got me wide open, mary jane, i wanna get next to you, ect. wut makes this a five star album is awesome beats on superhoes, and phat lyrics on lettin niggas know .  If u want a real soundtrack, then friday is the perfect soundtrack 4 u. Best Songs: 2. Dr.Dre - Keep There Heads Ringin' 4. Threat - Lettin' Niggas Know 5. Cypress Hill - Roll It Up, Light It Up, Smoke It Up 6. Mack 10 - Take A Hit 11. Funkdoobiest - Superhoes  13. E-A Ski - Blast If I Have To +music
Klute covers the whole spectrum+P+I've seen (heard--whatever) Klute spin a few times, and he is unbelievable. Mostly dark , hard stuff (which is my taste--see his Breakbeat Science Exercise mix CD). This orginally produced music by him brings out some different tastes I didn't realize he had in him. I'm not going to get into his "collage of genres" cd (#2) [revision--I actually wrote this review before I had given disc #2 a full listen. There is some really good sh** here--especially for you breaks/ party dj's--that would probably never think to look in a D&B's producers direction for such trax--check "Artificial Sense" and "Overchoice"], but cd #1 has a lot of flavours on it. I'm not a big 2 step fan, but "Part of Me" is completely addicting. "Problem Reaction" and "Tacky"--("Ether" falls somewhere in between 2 step & jungle)-- are typical Klute standouts, and only he and High Conrast could even get me in the 2 stepping groove (if you can call it that). According to silly people who don't have a clue about music, D&B is fading as a genre. But w/ more producers like Klute (and High Contrast) around, it will be here to stay.+music
Lennon crafts a thoroughly enjoyable Beatle's sounding record+P+This has always been my favorite John Lennon album because the production is fantastic and the songwriting is ecclectic and creative...  I also believe that this is probably the most consistent post solo-Beatle release because of all fab four post solo recordings, the album's production is flawless...  In 1973, Lennon told Rolling Stone that he had really enjoyed Paul's Band on the Run because he felt it was conceptual... thus, I've entertained the possibility that this album is in part, a response to Band on the Run because it displays conceptualism  and ecclectisism.   Like Band on the Run, Walls and Bridges displays The Beatles' unique ability to go from beautiful lush ballads to rocking rockers... at times, I feel like I'm listening to the White Album....the pentatonic 'Going Down on Love' tracks to the up-tempo, brisk, jazzy 'Whatever Gets You Thru The Night'... then, there's the soft Harry Nilson assisted number 'Old Dirt Road'... then John immidiately answers this mellow country song with 'What You Got' (which feels kind of like 'Everybody's Got Something To Hide Except For Me and My Monkey') and so on ... it has been suggested that John's '#9 Dream' was a subconscious tribute to George... I love this album because I feel that John is in harmony with his other Beatle compatriots  and that he's no longer bitter with his past like he was on Plastic Ono Band..  'Surprise Surprise' with Elton John even has a quotation from a Beatle's song... see if you can guess what it is...!!!  This is the first post Beatles album that really really sounds like something the Beatles would have been truly worthy of producing (unlike Band on the Run that although was a milestone for Paul only sustained mediocre production!!!)  This is also a fun album and along with All Things Must Pass and Tug of War, it stands as the best produced post Beatles recording.. If you're a Beatle's fan but think that there wasn't any good solo Beatle's album.... sit down on a quiet Sunday evening with a friend or two in front of a fire with some hot cocoa, sit back, and enjoy a great album!!+music
Human Stink+N+buy it so you can set it on fire. it'll be one of the most ENJOYABLE experiences you'll ever have. trust me on this one. it's like the biggest smallest victory one could ever achieve+music
Poor beyond poor beyond poor beyond poor beyond poor...+N+I remember Christmas a couple years back, when I saw a CD wrapped under the tree. Hoping it would either be by the Beatles or a computer game, I eagerly unwrapped it. I thought, oh no not pop music, but gave it a chance anyway. I'm sorry I did. The first three songs are all raps, and you know my feelings toward rap (If you don't, I hate it.) Hot In Herre is on my list of overrated songs, although Weird Al's parody, Trash, is hilarious. A bunch of boring songs, then Landslide, which is okay...more boring songs...No Doubt? Dear God, don't let them hurt me! More boring songs...hey, Hero, that's good, Don't Know Why is too. More boring songs...In My Place, that one's good...more boring songs...ONE LAST BREATH? MAKE IT STOP!!!!!!!! Don't buy this.+music
Worst Chicago album to me! +N+I can see why I saw the cassette version of this album in $1.99 bins in the '90s.  Chicago's 21st album was the worst album to me, easily the worst I've heard from them. The album sounds so boring, and the performances sound so uninspiring. Even the Diane Warren-written song sounds lousy, typical of her sappy ballad pap!  There's not one memorable song on here, compared to classics like If You Leave Me Now, Love Me Tomorrow or others. Don't hear a lot of their famous horns, only keyboards and pop songs.  And Ron Nevison produced this overproduced, overwrought fluff? If Chicago, with their extensive catalog, even thinks about performing one song from this album live, you might want to walk out of the theater to get concessions.  They are too multi-talented a band to let themselves get through this commercial flop that this album was in 1991! +music
11 years later...+P+and I'm still listening to this gem. To be honest, I bought this IN SPITE of "Kiss From a Rose". I hated that Seal was getting SO MUCH air play becaus of that song... not that the song was bad or anything, but I fell in love with his first album, and I thought "Kiss From a Rose" paled in comparison to tracks like: "Future Love Paradise" and "Violet".  All these years later, I can still enjoy listening to this CD. I am writing this review because I just popped it in while at work. There isn't a bad track on this thing+music
"Bill" is The Man I Knew-Smokey Robinson, R&B at it's Best+N+The old timers like me back in the inner cities where Smokey and the Miracles orginally put their stake down in Motown and R&B royalty, used to call him Bill Smokey Robinson. Whenever I meet someone who recalls the days back in the early to mid sixties when the black transistor made in Japan radios were blaring down the New York City school hallways playing The Tracks of my Tears, Shop Around, OOO Baby Baby (which brings back memories of my first interacial slow dance in the Junior High School gym) and the Tears of a Clown, all selections being on The Ultimate Collection~Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, I know that my buddy remembers Smokey's spindly aura on the stage and his silky smoooth and relaxed delivery. I apologize to my readers for run on sentences but Smokey requires such detailed explanation as a legendary contributor to soul, R&B and the Motown wall of sound (they had one too) that my effusive and continuing acclamation of this cherished and enormously loved performer is understated. I heard that Smokey recently brought his performance to Flint, Michigan or maybe some other backyard town in auto country. I really wish that I could have been there to see Smokey put out before a hometown crowd. That must have been nothing short of a miracle. I am going to hit the click button now myself, I need to hear again the sounds that captivated all of us when we walked down the hallways in Junior High with the made in Japans, fingerpopping all the way. Please note, I meant to push 5 stars on this CD and cannot figure out how to correct the above. I apoligize for any misunderstanding however everybody who has ever been touched by Smokey's music probably realized this faux pas.  Jay Adler,    Massapequa, New Yor+music
Beautiful guitar a la Django+P+Sometime not too long ago, Bireli Lagrene decided to stop running away from his God-given talent to play exactly as Django Reinhard, and instead embrace it. This record is in my opinion far better than Gypsy Project, which suffers from some highly irritating violin playing. For some viciously swinging gypsy jazz featuring  Bireli's astounding lines, I recommend Move! as well as the even better Routes to Django, recorded when Bireli was 13 years old.+music
This album is terrible+N+I didn't like Keep Right album at all and i was very disappointed.+music
Moving smartly along ...+N+Well, let's put it this way ...  I bought this when the vinyl was first released.  Went with all the other APP albums I had.  My 700 or so vinyl discs have since been entrusted to an old friend.    I've since purchased *almost* all the APP CDs that I once had on vinyl.  Not this one.    For me, Pyramid was the pinnacle -- 5 stars.  Love the rest of the first four, as well as Stereotomy and Gaudi -- 4 stars.  I'd give 3 stars to Vulture Culture and Eye in the Sky.  But this one and Eve just didn't do it for me.  On a tangentially related note ... if you haven't heard Godley & Creme's Goodbye Blue Sky, try to find yourself a copy.  A rollicking good time+music
If you were wondering.....+P+If you were wondering why so many musicians and critics (and fans) think so highly of Joni Mitchell's work, or if you've heard a few songs and would like to hear a broader sampling, Dreamland is the answer. It offers the heyday pop hits (Free Man in Paris, Help Me) some early folky touchstones, (Big Yellow Taxi, Circle Game), a selection from the fantastic jazz-rock masterpiece Hejira (Furry Sings the Blues), a delightful 80s comedy-drama with Billy Idol and Tom Petty in guest roles (Dancin' Clown) and much more, including some late career orchestral reinventions of earlier songs (Amelia, Both Sides Now). Dreamland is a delicious taste of the diverse and delightful Joni Mitchell catalog.+music
More than just an excitable boy...+P+Zevon become famous with "Werewolves of London," a satirical critique of the world's womanizers (past and present), but as true Zevon fans know, there was much more to this man than "aaaaaoooo, werewolves of London" and a three-chord progression that is as infectious as it is cutesy.  The true Warren Zevon was a poet of sorts, a man who tackled difficult subjects ("Excitable Boy," for example, with a final verse that still gives me shivers), but still remained a sensitive man at heart ("Accidentally Like a Martyr," for example; don't deny, it moves you).  From the you-know-what hitting the fan in "Lawyers Guns and Money," to the purely delightful recitation of "I Need a Truck," to the heart-wrenching "Tule's Blues," to the rockin' romp of "Nighttime in the Switching Yard," to the world's most famous undead Thompson-gun toting anti-hero in "Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner," EXCITABLE BOY remains a rock 'n roll classic.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say it's a staple rock album.  It is by far wittier and more creative than most rock albums ever produced; sure, there aren't too many screaming electric guitars (oh my God, is that guy playing a PIANO???), but EXCITABLE BOY is quite simply one of the best rock albums ever made.  Warren Zevon was a folk/rock artist like none before him...and, it's safe to say, like none we will ever see again+music
wings+N+I never received the item even though it showed available.  I don't think that should be able to list items they don't really have available+music
Only Time (remix)+N+A beautiful song. But, the remix was a disappointment. I thought I was getting the original version. I should have read the fine print. This is the first time I ordered anything from Amazon, so I suppose I learned a lesson+music
Lee Lessack Has Heart  AND Voice+P+Lee Lessack Is one of the finest singers in cabaret today. His CD stays in my player and always will. He combines ability with heart and this is truly an unusual and winning combination+music
Not Elvis at his best.+N+1972's Elvis Presley as recorded at madison square garden is not Elvis at the top of his game. The numerous covers he performs sound awful. I can give the album a few points for having some of his best known songs on it,unlike some of his live albums. Although the set is good, the performances leave something to be desired.Forget about this one and buy The NBC TV Special CD instead+music
Buy the cd not the single+N+I have listened to this cd many times and every time I listen to the single it just makes me mad.  The album version is a lot better and I wonder why Moby would want join forces with Gwen.  The cd's version is unbelievable and I was happy to hear it become a single.  I did not like Moby teaming with Gwen.  Buy the cd and see how much better Moby as an artist.  The music is much better and worth the money+music
Excellent musicians+P+This is my favourite Ella record of the moment. Check out &quot;Solitude&quot;, the guitar player is wonderful and is an excellent listen in itself. Bravo to you wherever you may be+music
maxi priest rules+P+If you want to hear a little Jamaica without going completely native Maxi Priest is the way to go+music
Taking the world by storm+P+I give this album five stars because there are five Top 10 hits on it. THAT'S NOT HER STYLE was a hit but did not appear on GREATEST HITS VOLUME 3. WE DIDN'T START THE FIRE was the first hit from the album. It tells about world history from 1949(the year of Billy's birth) to 1989,the year this album was released. THE DOWNEASTER &quot;ALEXA&quot; is about a fisherman's life on a boat called THE DOWNEASTER &quot;ALEXA&quot;. Alexa is Billy's daughter whose mom is Christie Brinkley. I GO TO EXTREMES has the style of Billy's Columbia records labelmates,Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band. SHAMELESS starts off in a contemporary style and later converts to hard rock. STORM FRONT is another boat song. LENINGRAD is a ballad about a Russian man named Viktor and an American man and his daughter(possibly Billy and Alexa) visiting there. STATE OF GRACE really rocks. WHEN IN ROME has listeners &quot;doing what the Romans do&quot;. Then there's the easy listening AND SO IT GOES which is only Billy's voice and piano. The total playing for this CD is precisely 45 minutes+music
A classic album!+P+From the laid-back observations of Passenger to the anguished soul squeals of Turn Blue, Iggy injects a range of styles with honesty and irony.  From beginning to end, a perfect listening experience!  I don't think even one song is sub-par!  If you like rock, you must own Lust For Life! +music
Worst album EVER!!!....+N+let me first say this, Roots is basically Paul Simon's Graceland, except nu-metalized. these guys went to south america, cut a couple of terrible tracks with "natives"?, then filled the rest of it out with generic nu-metal crapola with that guy from Korn cut and pasted into the mix for good measure. this is a particularily bad example of the vile and thank-you-god-in-heaven-it's-dead Nu-metal genre-meaningless pissed off lyrics, excessive "guesting" of other crappy artist, bad guitar, bad sitar(!), and the inclusion of anything to do with Korn, all presumabely done with band members sporting loinclothes and Rambo style striped face paint. the biggest waste of time, money, and matter. Its a shame that these guys are living and breathing and taking up space and resources that someone else could be using. A real bummer. +music
Grungy rechanneled sound+N+Nice package....attractive and it has almost all of the tracks by this minor group that you would want, but they took the GNP Crescendo album master tapes...complete with tons of horrible-sounding rechanneled tracks and grungy, distorted stereo.  The sound is no better than the old GNP CDs that have been around for years....which were 10th generation copies of the masters for the vinyl LPs.  Finally, the track are in no particular order and there's no information about each track fits into The Seeds body of music.  It's apparent that the guy who prepared this collection (Pat Gilbert) knows nothing about the era and is defintively not the guy to have done this reissue+music
this guy = phony+N+wonder why there are 35 used copies of this cd at the moment? cause its craaaaaaaaaap!!!! like rockabilly?  like swing? this aint the place to find it...  setzer is nothin but a 50s wannabe who looks stupid, acts stupid and plays even stupider music.  there is nothing real about this music... it is a fashion trend that is no dead, so go home setzer in that heinously ugly hotrod of yours+music
Uh.  haha. +P+Well, this album is pretty terrible, but I like it anyway.   If you're looking for an album to get you into Modest Mouse, then this definitely isn't it.    Anyone else who would want it probably already has it.+music
As unique as any of their albums.+P+Probably the best album of the last five years, alot more foccussed sounding than "Life on other planets" and miles better than anything else thats around at the moment.+music
It's Just a Mess...+N+I disagree with the spotlight reviewer's assertion that this movie-musical was overproduced; it seems more to suffer from Spartan-like efforts in production.  I did enjoy the fact that part of Oz was in an urban setting (i.e., the subway station), but it looked like they didn't even try to clean it up a little.  But enough about the movie, this is the soundtrack...and as I stated above, it's a mess.  This classification mainly rests on the shoulders our "Diva Supreme" Diana Ross.  Stephanie Mills set the bar high, and Miss Ross did not even come CLOSE to that standard.  She was a visible, vocal and emotional failure.  Her renditions of "Be a Lion" and Home" (my favorite two songs} were dreadful--in the latter she even sang incorrect lyrics.  She just does not have the talent or ability to effectively communicate Dorothy's character, let alone sing her songs right.  I would rate this with ZERO stars if it were at all possible.  However, the two stars are earned by the members of the original cast (especially Mabel King) and one addition: Ms. Lena Calhoune Horne.  She was radiant in voice and appearance and brought the level of inspiration and power up a notch as she belted out "Believe in Yourself".  They alone save this movie and album from just being a total misstep.  Yet, we still have Diana Ross here absolutely slaughtering the vocals and pathos of Dorothy, so all-in-all it's just a mess+music
Wow!+P+Oreja de Van Gogh really's beyond comparison.  I recommend it to anyone who enjoys imports as much as I do. Its really a mix of pop, rock, ska, raggae, electronica, and ballads. I got this CD thinking it would have the song &quot;Cuidate&quot; in it, without even checking on the back, but I wasn't disappointed when I realized it was the wrong CD.  &quot;Cuentame al Oido&quot; is simply mesmorizing, and &quot;Viejo Cuento&quot; and &quot;Dile Al Sol&quot; are really cool too.  Listen to the entire CD..it's good for a variety of moods.  Enjoy+music
The highest of the highest +N+Shlomo has become the heart and soul of Jewish music, even in the synagogue. His melodies are now 'davvaned' in places which once cursed him.  He was without question a musical genius whose depth of soul is reflected in every note and word he sings. In this early music one can already hear that longing, that love which so touches the listener. His voice is not great, but the feeling it conveys goes well beyond what is ordinarily given in most singing. He has the holy in him, the nearness to and longing for G-d. And he conveys that to us, so sweetly, so beautifully.  Oy heilegen Shlomo what would we do without your music?+music
BAD CD+N+MONO SOUND JUST A REAL BAD CD+music
She Stepped It Up+P+You gotta admit that this is not the same Genie In a Bottle girl showing up on this album. This is a very mature album and glad that Christina took charge of her direction in music. It definitely paid off and anyone who listens to it won't be disappointed.+music
Turn back to roots, Rick+N+I vas very disappointed after I was listening to this record.Rick looses his fine sense for jazzy sound,and falled in a deep stupid commerce.I will wait for the next album anyway, but....turn back to your roots Rick!+music
Good Soundtrack, but only if you LOVE the movie!+P+I enjoyed this soundtrack, but I love this movie also! Anybody that doesn't like the movie is more than likely not going to like this+music
I really like Celine, but what was this?+N+I was just a little confused when this cd came out a few years ago.  I bought it because well...it's Celine, and I adore her.  BUT...why did she release this cd besides to make some money during her absence?  I mean' C'mon!  Where's volume 2 or 3?  Are we going to get them, or are we just stuck with this volume 1 with VERY RANDOM songs on it?  If you're a Celine fan, get this cd to fill out your collection, but if you're not...don't waste your money.  If you want a Celine album, I would recommend All the Way: Decade of Hits, and One Heart+music
Hushed Ella+P+Tinkling piano and romantic songs turn The Intimate Ella into a smokey, late night affair. A very specific, slightly dour, yet beautiful recording. Not your typical Ella+music
The worst of Ofra Haza.+N+Having bought Shaday and Kirya by miss Haza, i bought Desert Wind with the notion that it would be as fantastic as the aforementioned. Boy was i wrong. Gone are the heavy Yemenite/Israeli beats and flavor, as is Haza singing in Hebrew. Instead, I found her beautiful voice swallowed up by abhorrent 80's synth-pop cheese and benal lyrical content, with Hebrew only in the chorus at most. There is not a single song, with the exception of "Slave Dream" that I could bear to listen to all the way through, and most of the songs are laughably bad. So, fans of Haza's other works, do yourself a favor and save your [money] and buy Shaday or Kirya. Unless you want a good laugh, then by all means, purchase away+music
absolutely surerb!+P+I love every track of this CD. Specially, 'Missing you now', 'Now that I found you' and 'We're not making love anymore'. He sounds so perfect for me and I completely leave everything when anybody plays his song. Great lyrics, perfect pitch and absolutely worthy CD to buy. ITS SUPERB and deserves more than 5 stars+music
the worst Green day record+N+In 2001 during the (good ridance)time of your life craze they released a Cd to make every song accustic to like time of your life.+music
average Group+N+Dru Hill had some alright cuts,but were a dime a dozen R&B Group. to me they were a Poor Man's Jodeci.sisqo had a decent voice,but seemed kind of gimmicky at times."Tell me" was a decent cut,but "In My Bed" was my cut by them.I dug the re-mix.everything else I could take or leave+music
Huh?+N+This is a joke.  It has too much uninspired music from Browne's later albums, and leaves out classics like "That Girl Could Sing."  Sadly, there are no decent collections of Jackson Browne's music yet released, and fans will still have to get all of his great albums separately and make their own collections.    From other reviews, I gather that rock snobs are frustrated by the album's omission of "obscure gems."  And people like me who just want to hear the great songs we grew up with are equally disappointed. +music
I'm not one to promote Celine Dion but....+P+Because she's like adult contemporary and I'm not supposed to like her because I'm not part of her target demographic but damn this CD is great. It's not surprising that the Grammy's picked this as Album of The Year. Even the upbeat songs here are not bad for Celine. It's a crime most of these songs were never released because they are so good, in my opinion, even better than her massive Titanic hit song. My favorites are Falling Into You, I Love You and Dreamin' of You. I don't own any other Celine's albums but I'm glad I have this one+music
GO FROGGY GO !!!!!!+P+You didn't think you've seen the last of "The Annoying Thing", did you ?   Well now he's back and better than ever with an all-new album featuring the new hit single "We Are the Champions (Ding-a-Dang-Dong)" based on the song by Queen.   Other songs include "I Will Survive", "Ice Ice Baby", and "Copa Banana".  In comparison to the UK import album, the US album exclusively has revamped versions of Eiffel 65's "Blue (Da Ba Dee)" and Rednex's "Cotton-Eyed Joe", two of my favorites.   The UK album, however, exclusively has froggy versions of "I'm Too Sexy" and "The Final Countdown", as well as the full version of "Go Froggy Go", the bizarre "Crazy Jodeling", and the even more bizzare "Nellie the Elephant".   Also there's "Super Crazy Sounds" which sounds so totally mixed up and around, if you know what I mean.  Either way, I like this new album a whole lot.   Better than the first, even +music
Deeply devout music from our greatest Christian composer+P+This disc contains three works by Russian-Tatar composer Sofia Gubaidulina, an artist of deep religious sentiment as is apparent in these titles: "In croce", "Silenzio", and "Sieben Worte". The common instruments in these works are the cello and the bayan. The latter is a type of Russian accordian played here by Elsbeth Moser, who performed in the Western premier of "Sieben Worte" and to whom Gubaidulina dedicated "Silenzio." Cello is played by Maria Kliegel, who has performed under the approval of Rostropovich.  "In Croce" was originally written in 1979 as a piece for organ and cello, but it is represented here in a 1991 arrangement for cello and bayan by Elsbeth Moser which Gubaidulina has approved. It is an exploration of "vertical" music (the organ or bayan) intersected by the "horizontal" (cello), thus forming the cruciform symbolism so common in Gubaidulina's work. Personally, I prefer the performance of the cello and organ version by Ivashkin and Hicks released by Chandos, for the organ just seems to work better than the bayan. Still, Kliegel's cello work here is deeply moving and worth hearing, less restrained than Ivashkin's but perhaps more passionately religious.  "Silenzio" is a fragile, insubstantial piece for bayan, violin, and cello in which the vast majority of the work is played pianissimo. It consists of five "miniatures" which all maintain the same rhythmic proportion 7-2-5 in varying ways. It is an interesting experiment, but it results in the least interesting item on this disc, and it's technical brilliance comes at the expense of religious power.  "Sieben Worte (Seven Words)" for cello, bayan, and strings, is a crucial piece in this disc, and in Gubaidulina's oeuvre in general. I have said before that the composer's "Johannes-Passion" may be the greatest work of Christian piety of our time, but "Sieben Worte" follows not very long behind. It is an acknowledgement of the tradition of religious composition, and contains quotations from Heinrich Schuetz and clear influence from Haydn. Nonetheless, the bulk of the piece shows the originality of Gubaidulina through and through and has an elaborate technical basis on the cello which is too long to quote here, but which is included in the liner notes. The strings of the Camerata Transsylvanica (ironically based in Budapest after the emigration of its members) under Gyorgy Selmeczi are intense and unfaltering.   As is unfortunately usual with Naxos discs, the weak point is the liner notes. The English and German are, inexplicably, two different commentaries instead of a common text translated from one or the other. Keith Anderson's English commentary is quite interesting but poorly edited and unprofessional. Teresa Pieschacon Raphael's German commentary tells something about Gubaidulina's place in the Soviet music community which English readers too should have been able to enjoy. Though Naxos was kind enough to provide commentaries in two languages, the profile of the performers is only in English.  These three pieces, especially the last, make an excellent introduction to the work of this superlative composer, and at an economic price. This is one of the finest works in my collection, and I sincerely and passionately recommend it to just about anyone+music
UNBELIEVABLE TALENT+P+YOUTHFUL PRAISE HAS ONCE AGAIN PROVED TO BE A DOMINANT FORCE IN THE GOSPEL INDUSTRY! THE CD IS FILLED WITH SO MANY INSPIRATIONAL SONGS, INCREDIBLE CHOIR HARMONY, AMAZING SOLOIST, AND SLAMMING MUSIC.  THEY HAVE GROWN AND GOTTEN SO MUCH BETTER SINCE THE VERY UPLIFTING "AWESOME GOD" DEBUT ALBU+music
undeniable pop masterpiece+P+_blue_ is simply a masterpiece of pop-rock music! it has tons of massive hooks, sweet grooves, incredible melodies, awesome vocals courtesy of mr. jenkins, and dashes of experimentalism! the melodies soar overhead with his sweet falsetto voice, the drums rip and roar through some funky bass grooves, and the guitars strum delicately or spit out a distorted lullaby of happiness. as much as i enjoy third eye blind's eponymous debut album (which is one of my favorite pop albums ever), i think _blue_ is even better. it is impossible to deny the songsmanship on display here. everyone should listen to this album+music
Great Comedy Material+P+The only reason i bought this is to make fun of it. sure it brings back a few memories when my sister had some of  his 45's. But in no way shape or form does this have any merrit or substance. Nothing aginst Shawn personnaly i'm sure he made a few bucks in his career, Corporate America at it's best! Ilove this stuff!!+music
Original Audio CD Verison Still Available+N+With regard to concerns about the audio quality of the this MP3 version, the original audio CD version ("The Collector's Edition"), an 8-CD set, is still available from Amazon UK. I paid a little more than twice the MP3 price. The ISBN number of the Audio CD version is 0-563-47702-4+music
Disappointment+N+The soundtrack was a total disappointment since I purchhased it entirely for the last track featuring some awesome guitar. I will be returning it tomorrow+music
Best Single Disc Collection of the UNI/MCA Years+P+While Neil has written and recorded a wealth of outstanding material throughout his career, his albums have tended to be a bit uneven.  Perhaps that's why there are so many Neil Diamond compilation albums on the shelf these days.  This collection culls the best selections from his late 60s and early 70s UNI/MCA albums.  In fact, this set is essentially an expanded version of the now out-of-print His 12 Greatest Hits.  And while that album supplanted the studio versions of Sweet Caroline and Holly Holy with strong live versions from Hot August Night, this collection restores the original studio recordings.  Hot August Night, Neil's last MCA album before leaving for Columbia, is represented with the stellar live version of Cherry, Cherry.  But as good as that version is, I would have dropped it (along with the cover of He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother) for Cold Water Morning, Glory Road and Two-Bit Manchild.  That's a minor quibble though, as this set does contain all of the essential recordings from the period in breathtakingly pristine sound quality.  Several reviewers have complained about the lack of certain songs (Heartlight, Kentucky Woman, Thank the Lord for the Night Time, etc.).  For the record, this is a compilation of Neil's best work from his UNI/MCA recording era (1968-1972).  The early singles (Thank the Lord for the Night Time, Kentucky Woman, Solitary Man and the original studio version of Cherry, Cherry) were recorded for Bang Records in 1966 and 1967.  The best collection of the early Bang Records material is Classics: The Early Years.  America and Love on the Rocks were recorded for Capitol while most later era songs like September Morn, If You Know What I Mean and Heartlight were recorded for Columbia (beginning with the Jonathan Livingston Seagull album in 1973).  The best single-disc collection of Neil's Columbia material is probably 12 Greatest Hits, Volume II.  Fans interested in purchasing a career spanning retrsopective may be tempted to buy Greatest Hits 1966-1992 or The Essential Neil Diamond but both of those compilations suffer from the inclusion of inferior live versions of in place of the original studio recordings.  The career spanning box set, In My Lifetime, largely avoids the live version replacement issue that plagues other compilations but it suffers from its own share of problems, namely an abundance of mildly interesting (but ultimately unnecessary) rarities.  The most efficient method of compiling your own triple disc, career spanning box set is to purchase these three titles: Classics - The Early Years [Neil's Bang Records recordings from 1966-1967], The Neil Diamond Collection [the UNI/MCA sampler reviewed above], and 12 Greatest Hits Volume II [the best of the Capitol and Columbia years]. +music
Sparkling and exotic!+P+Unlike some of the other "Mondo" albums, this collection may not be representative of the breadth and depth of Indian music, but it makes for great listening all the same.  "Mondo Asian" features primarily the polished, intricately textured compositions of R.A. Rahman, billed as "India's greatest contemporary film composer".  The CD cover continues: "By incorporating western production styles and sensibilities to Indian traditions, Rahman has created a music that is universal even as it is distinctly Indian."  Traditional Indian instruments and vocal techniques merge with western harmonies and structures to create compositions that are as fascinating as they are fun. Especially striking are the hypnotic track #11, "Gropika Poornima", and track #8, the mysterious and sinuous "Suno Re", which was written by Rahman's student, Vishal+music
EAST COAST JUNK !+N+I DON'T LIKE DJ CLUE,I DON'T LIKE JAY-Z,I DON'T LIKE MEMPHIS BLEEK BUT I DO LIKE METHODMAN NOT REDMAN.THIS CD IS NOT WORTH BUYING,I DIDN'T EVEN BUY IT I HEARD IT FROM A FRIEND.THIS ALBUM IS NOTHING BUT JUNK+music
Ringo is a star+P+Very nostalgic.  When I was a kid, Photographs was the first song I ever heard true "stereo" on.  Listening almost 25 years later, half the songs are pretty good, have are really kind of lousy, but the nostalgia is all great!+music
The most underrated band in America+P+What can I say about Cracker's &quot;The Golden Age&quot;?  I have had this tremendous album for years and it is still fresh to me to this day.  It is easily one of my favorite albums, and I have a lot of music.  The album is awesome, consistent yet not generic. It hits you hard with bone-crunching guitar powered anthems (Sweet Thistle Pie, Nothing to Believe In, 100 Flower Power Maximum), then loosens up with catchy Crackeresque sarcastic songs (How Can I Live Without You, Useless Stuff) and then blows your mind with blissfully mellow thought-provoking tunes that sound out of a western ghost town (Bicycle Spaniard, Big Dipper).  The core of Cracker was and always will be David Lowery and Jon Hickman - other members have come and gone - yet not missed that much.  The Golden Age saw Cracker at an all time high when coming off their stupendous predecessor album, the platinum &quot;Kerosene Hat,&quot; which featured the hits &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;Eurotrash Girl.&quot;  Some may feel that this album does not live up to Kerosene's greatness, yet others like myself, find this album even better and more consistent.  This is a true great American band that has never quite gotten their due, and they should be recognized for bringing back fond memories of classic-rock bands like the Heartbreakers, the Byrds, the Eagles, Led Zeppelin, and even the great Neil Young with their tunes.  If you have not heard The Golden Age, or Cracker for that matter, you are missing out - so what are you waiting for?.  There have been so many flash in the pan bands as well as the other drek that fills our radio airwaves lately. A band like Cracker is truly a breath of fresh air and originality to the true &quot;music&quot; fan, not just some sampled, generic, over-the-hill, bubble gum, or boy band shlock that makes me want to puke.  The opening track, I Hate My Generation, speaks volumes to me about what is going on in the music industry these days: corporate greed.  This album, The Golden Age, in the words of Spinal Tap's Nigel Tufnel, truly goes to 11.  Five stars out of five - a classic+music
An album for the middle of the day on Saturaday or cruising+P+This is a great album with an insane amount of energy that if you listen to it. . .right before you go out for the night, run errands, take a long drive, then this is the album that is a necessity in a music collection. Though too much of a good thing, is never a good thing, so moderate intake with the previous album.  Switch it up, go crazy, do whatever just do something. I gotta run some errands now+music
Save your money!!!+N+I wish amazon allowed giving "zero" stars to an album.  I bought my first John & Yoko album in 1969 ("Life with the Lions.") I got "ripped off," although I should have know better..  I was smart enough not to buy "Two Virgins" because of the bad reviews.  I bought "Life with the Lions" without reading any reviews, but I was young, naive, and a big Lennon fan.  Oh well!  The John & Yoko albums released before the breakup of the Beatles were all pretty much the same.  The chief instigator of these albums seems to be Yoko.  Her background in the "avant garde" and "conceptual art" is apparent in these albums.  The basic premise is: take a "concept" and run with it.  Keep running with it for as long as possible.  Let's hear John & Yoko call each other by their first names for a half-hour.  Let's produce feedback and screaming longer than one can normally tolerate.  After all, the big joke is that John Lennon's name is on this album... so even if the "concepts" are questionable and/or idiotic- lots of people will BUY this piece of vinyl because a Beatle has his name on the cover!!!  "The Wedding Album" was the BIGGEST rip-off I ever experienced as a Beatles fan and purchaser of all things Beatle.  When this album came out in 1969 it was priced HIGHER than a regular album because it was a big box!  The graphics for this product HAD to cost more than the recording costs.  The recording part of this project was interminable and amateurish.  Feel like hearing John & Yoko calling each other by their first names for a half hour?  Feel like hearing "home audio" of every inane bit of their "bed-in for peace?"  I sometimes think the most "conceptual" thing John & Yoko could've done with this project would have been giving the customer an EMPTY box!  It probably would've sounded better.    Buying the CD version of "The Wedding Album" seems bizarre.  The product was designed for vinyl and you lose so much graphic presentation in the CD format.  The only blessing in the CD version is the inclusion of three actual SONGS.  However, the three actual songs are Yoko's.  So maybe it's not that big a blessing after all.  All three tunes were B-sides to Plastic Ono Band singles.    I don't recommend buying ANY of John & Yoko's "conceptual" albums.  Do yourself a favor and make one of your own!!+music
AMAZING!+P+First of all, I LOVE this show!!! I just got my CD in the mail...and i've already listened to the whole thing! I LOVE it!!+music
A Rhino Dissapointment-Very Incomplete+N+What I have come to expect of Rhino is thoroughness, and this CD certainly is not thorough, although what is here is of course done very well. Where are the hits Half the Way,Why have you left the one you left me for, etc?  I think this could have been a great collection if made longer, or possibly even a two CD set, although maybe they figured nobody would spring for that......too bad, it remains a &quot;couldve been great&quot;.....+music
OH Jeez, the Cheese is Hilarious!+P+My sister introduced me to Richard Cheese and I think I busted something laughing at the music/lyric combo.  This stuff is HILARIOUS.  That said, my baby daughter also digs this music.  Sadly I am going to need to ditch this CD before she learns to talk or we are going to be in some deep S#@&T+music
Rubber Soul, Dark Side, Stone Roses+P+I was initially sceptical of the Stone Roses and for a long time I never really gave them a chance. However after numerous recommendations i finally decided to giv ethis album a go and found (to my surprise)  uplifting and repetitivly entertaining album.  From the opening of I Wanna Be Adored to Waterfall to Bye Bye Badman to I Am The Ressurection and the bonus track on this disc Fool's Gold. What most impresses me about this album is it's ability to not only keep your intention for 10 minutes plus (Both Fool's Gold and I Am The Ressurection push double figures) and still leave you yearning for more like The Velvet Underground's I'm Waiting For The Man you could just keep listening for hours.  All in all this is a fantastic album well worth the title of Greatest album of all time (If not close), A+ for Squire's boys+music
2 of the best+P+What a pleasure to sit down and listen to such great artists, they certainly do not come like that today. Great sound to, it's like one is there, job well done by the sound people. I saw Louis Armstrong in Holland in 1959 and it will always be for me the best jazz concert I have ever been to. I recommend this CD to anyone. Aalf J Molenberg.+music
I like the two together+P+Hello,  I like Armstrong and Fitzgerald together.  And this is the completed Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstong together ON VERVE RECORDS. The previous reviewers have a few facts wrong.  Ella and Louis did record Dream a Little Dream of Me on DECCA Records.  You can find this recording on Ella Fitzgerald: The Last Decca Years.  True, GRP has released a great deal of Ella's Decca output, there are some cuts missing, due from my understanding, some legal complexity.  Ella did record Baby, It's Cold Outside with Louis Jordan.  The track isn't included in any of Ella's Decca CD outputs, but it was included in The Complete Louis Jordan on Decca.  But, Baby It's Cold Outside isn't on any of the 9 CDs, it is on the EP that came in the CD box set+music
Warning, Do Not Buy Me!!+N+this is pure dung, I can't believe that Luca Turilli was involved with this cd+music
Avoid+N+I bought this cd for one reason only- Kyu Sakamoto's "Sukiyaki".  Unfortunately, this 1994 compilation cd has a tremendous amount of hiss which makes for an annoying and disappointing listening experience.  You will be much happier buying one of Kyu's newer cds with better noise reduction technology, and as an added bonus, you will also be rewarded with his other material which you will not get with this bad cd.+music
Relationship Music+P+What could you say about Lionel Richie when he started his career with The Commodores and later solo.  All fourteen songs were written by him which were all chart toppers of its time.  Let alone his music crossed genres over to country from pop / R&B tunes.  Only those in relationships that's worth fighting for will find this LP of all love songs pleasurable.  This has feelings and depths with the arrangements and vocal range of Lionel+music
Massive Attack want your Protection!!!!!+P+Protection was released in 1994. With Tricky already having success with his own newly made group Portishead, & with their massive hit album Dummy just around the corner, there was alot of pressure on Massive Attack. So on the album they used Everything but the girl's Tracy Thorn on lead vocals to replace Blue Line's female vocalist Shara Nelson, although she would return for the 1998 smash hit album Mezzanine.  The album begins with the lushous Protection, the groups sound has definitely changed, as it's more of a heavy beat than the first album & Tracy's vocals really work here. Karma Koma is next, this would be a very popular radio hit, and remains to this day perhaps the groups most well known song. Three is quite a dark track, again Tracy on vocals here, whilst the ellegant yet dark instrumental Weather Storm continues into the darkness. Spying Glass is a more of a hip tune, performed by Del Naja, whilst Better Things is a smooth sould tune, skillfully performed by Tracy. Euro Child is suprisingly the first rap song since Karma Koma (I say suprisingly as Blue Lines contained alot of rap tunes in it) Tracy's on vocals again for Sly, which returns kinda into the darkness, whilst if Sly was kinda returning the second instrumental of the album Heat Miser is definitely in the darkness. The album strangely ends with a live rendition of The Doors classic Light my Fire, but done in Massive style, it has to be heard to be believed!!!!  Protection is definitely different from its predecessor Blue Lines & whilst I'd definitely recommend it, I think I would advice people who are new to the group to buy Blue Lines first as Protection may be a bit too much for them to handle at first. The band would continue their direction towards darker music four years later in the smash hit release Mezzanine!!!+music
Angela Hewitt at her finest+P+If you are newer to Bach's abundent solo keyboard music - or Angela Hewitt - then this CD is an excellent place to start. It features the popular "French Overture" and contains some of the more lyrical and "accessible" music Bach wrote for the keyboard. There is a delightful mix of Bach compositions here capturing the diverse musical styles from Italy, France, Germany and Spain.  Bach shows himself to be a true "non-politico" as well as the master composer by skillfully combining these styles (namely from France and Italy) to produce works of great appeal and mastery - but in a style that is uniquely "Bach."  In the opening piece, Hewitt does great justice to Bach's tribute to the Italian concerto style with a convincing "dialog" between lighter solo episodes (tutti) and the fuller passages imitating orchestral effect (ritornello) - all on one keyboar of course.  This piece is most famous for the Adagio which Hewitt infuses with much heart and soul by her delicate, thoughtful melodic lines that never approach over sentimentality.  The main event of this CD must certainly be the monumental "French Overture" (aka: Partita in B minor) - a grand conception lasting some 30 minutes repleat with numerous movements of French courtly dance influence and rich in imaginative and decorative keyboard effects.  Miss Hewitt wonderfully articulates these effervescent rhythms with supreme confidence and masterful result.  Her ornamentations are always tasteful, seamlessly integrated and truly enthralling to hear.  In the off-beat rhythms of the gigue, her semiquavers bounce off the page with great poise and the crispness of fresh-pressed linen.  And she shows her masterful pianism to its fullest in the curious final "echo" movement, bringing an brilliant, orchestral quality to it.  Hiding in the shadows of these two main events are four charming little "duets."  These are no mere "fillers" but delightfully catchy, two-part inventions that Hewitt plays to full effect.  Rounding out the program is a most unique "program music" piece by Bach thought written around the story of his older brother's departure ("Capriccio on departure of his brother").  In it, Angela Hewitt communicates both its nostalgic sentiments with her gentle, poinant phrasing and dynamics along with the piece's festive celebratory ending with her effective creation of trumpet and horn effects.  In this unique composition, Hewitt succeeds to create a wonderful range of emotive effects in one piece.  Indeed, her carefree yet tight-on-the-rails style truly seems to bring out the best of Bach's keyboard treasures - transforming them into music of great vitality and charm.  Her approach to Bach is one of artistry, nuance and good taste (not unlike Schiff) but without the "directness" or the "rough edges" that can be found in other performer's approaches (Gould and Gulda, respectfully).  The many great Bach performers through the last decades have given us many "pallates of color" to experience, and Hewitt's colors are most notably beauty of tone, a poetic flavor, and graceful fluidity of line at its heart.  It is no wonder that Angela Hewitt has been heralded as "the premier Bach pianist of this generation." Just about any recording of Bach's keyboard music by Angela Hewitt is a safe bet for being among the top choices available, and this CD is certainly no exception.  It received the highest marks from both Gramaphone and Penguin Guides while ClassicsToday gave it a perfect 10/10 for Artisty/Sound Quality.  In all her Bach recordings from Hyperion, the sound quality of this recording is among the fullest and most realistically recorded (where some other recordings like her Couperin, WTC or French Suites are done with a touch more "spaciousness" but still with clarity).  Also a highlight are the scholarly and detailed notes delineating the nuances of the various "dance" types that Bach encorporated into his compositions.  In all, an emmensely satisfying recording from a top Bach pianist of our time.  Highly recommended+music
Just what our pool needed!+P+The Aquatics Director wanted the atmosphere at our club pool to provide a "California Summer" feel.  The Surfin' sounds of the Ventures really hit the spot...and made me feel young again+music
What a mess+N+First the sound quality is poor - I had my stereo turned almost up to max and it was just loud enuf to hear.  Then there are the uncredited/unlisted "bonus tracks" - they are comercials/radio ads for Ike & Tina.  The version of "River Deep, Mountain High" is not the Phil Spector version.+music
An Album in the Same Style as This Left Feels Right Doesn't Crack it With Original Songs+N+I was very disappointed with the latest album from Bon Jovi, a band that has put out numerous exceptionally high quality albums throughout their career.  Obviously no one still expects them to put out albums today that set the scene of what is cool music wise, that they did back in the 80's and early 90's with the classics such as Slippery When Wet, New Jersey and Keep the Faith.  Obviously like everyone else from that era they rely on the next generation to tell them what is the latest rage music wise but this album music wise doesn't seem to fall into the latest style or ignore the latest trends and maintain their classic sound.   The album is like a continuation sound wise of their previous album This Left Feels Right, which was a greatest hits album rerecorded with their classic songs in a way that emphasised their lyrics.  That was great for the classics songs hearing them in a new way but this style for a whole album of new songs really doesn't do anything for me or anyone else I've come across.  Have a Nice Day is catchy and fast enough to be a great live song and it'll be around for a while if not forever but I don't think in five years time any other song from this album, like with other mediocre albums like Crush and Bounce will be played on the radio or at a Bon Jovi concert (and make sure you go to one of these before you or they die as they are the best live band one earth).  I hope that the guys have a few more good albums left in them but this certainly is not an indication that they do.                      +music
Elevator Music to Hell!!!!!!!!!+N+Terrible. This album is terrible. All tracks the same. Terrible take off on the song, the dance. Wow, it's so bad, don't know where to begin. Awful. Simply disgusting, this musician should play different music with his talent. Awful. Terrible. Disgusting. No musician in the world would recomend this album for anything. Disgusting. Little tinkerbell chimes in background of songs. So ridiculously bad it's not even funny. If you buy this. You just wasted some Money. needlessly. I bought it. Terrible mistake. Disgusting. might have made me laugh from stupidity if it was a little better. Terrible. Awful. Disgraceful.  WOW WHAT A STUPID C+music
I'm thinking this is THE BEST+P+As much as I loved this album there IS one thing better. That is watching The Chieftains and Mr Nunez perform live.  What a wonderful experience both are! +music
Okay...the movie is better+N+Simply put, the music is fine, but for what it's worth, you might as well see the movie.  Unless you have a hunger to listen to music intended for background music, just get the movie, you'll see that the songs fit better when placed along with the movie+music
Too Cool+P+Great Seller - This is one of my favorite cd's - Too, Too Cool!+music
Have had this on cassette for some time, but wanted to update+P+I have had this album on cassette tape for some time, and decided to update to CD format. Needless to say, if it wasn't a fine album, I wouldn't have pursued this title CD. Fabulous as ever+music
Boring+N+Yes this CD will put you to sleep in minutes.  Its the most boring uninspiring classical music.  The first CD was very good but this Vol. 2 is like most movie sequels....AWFUL +music
Huge disappointment+N+This album will only appeal to die hard UB40 fans and not casual fans or fans who loved the old up tempo sound of UB40 on LOL 1 and 2. This album only has 2 up tempo songs that sound like the old UB40 from the early 80's and early 90's. Download the songs Come Back Darling and Mr. Fix it, so you can save your money. I love UB40, but after listening to LOL 1 and 2 I thought LOL 3 was going to be a classic, but it is not close compared to the previous LOL albums and seems like it was just put out to make a quick buck because there was no passion in the music and singing, which made the entire album boring or like Reggae elevator music until I heard the two songs I already mentioned and recommend downloading. Those two songs saved the album in my opinion, otherwise it would have gotten zero stars.   +music
Disappointed, I Miss the Old UB's+N+I miss the old UB40 stuff you could skank to. The beats on this album's tracks are too &quot;club&quot; for me.  Labour of Love and Labour of Love II are some of the best Reggae albums ever made, this one though is has  almost that &quot;industial&quot; sound to it that's so popular in Europe.   If it weren't for &quot;Come Back Darling&quot; and &quot;Mr Fix It&quot;  this CD might be a total loss.  So it gets 1 star for each of those songs  from me+music
Excellent Old school+P+AWB is a very underrated band.  Their talent is definitely for the mature R&B fan who enjoys funk.  If this description fits you, you will love Pickin' up the Pieces.  There were more great songs on the cd than I expected.  "Cloudy" and "A Love of Your Own" were THE slow jams when I was in High School.  I am so glad to now have this cd in my collection.+music
A nice reference copy+P+Bernard Roberts is someone who I'd characterize as a master crafsman who can be relied on to give a good interpretation of the works without taking them over (e.g. like a Glenn Gould). The result is not just good listening but its makes for a recording that's an invaluable study aid for anyone who's trying to learn this material. Since the 48 are not just pieces of music but Bach's demonstration of styles and keyboard technique -- something that Dr. Roberts seems to understand very well -- you end up with a lot more than some CDs, a plastic case and a few sleeve notes......if you could only figure it all out, of course+music
One of the Most Annoying Songs Ever Created by Humans!+N+This album contains one of THE MOST ANNOYING Songs I've ever Heard in My life... "Afternoon Delight".  The only good thing about that song is that is was SO Overplayed, that no one dares play it anymore while others are in Hearing Range! :+music
Amazing+P+Thsi album is amazing, they use simple household noises and make it into music, these people are geniuses! This album sounds great, it's very insturmental. It's like a clash of noises and happy,cuddly things, and dreamy stuff! It really gets you thinking.+music
A Fun and Enjoyable Trip Down Memory Lane+P+If you like Huey Lewis, don't hesitate to pick up this disc.  It has a nice mixture of hits from the 80s, 90s, and today.  You can tell the upper end of Huey's voice has suffered a little bit with age.  But otherwise he and his (now) larger band sound great.  I especially enjoyed the new arrangement of "Do You Believe in Love."  As somebody who grew up during the 80s (when Huey was at his peak), this disc has been a real treat to listen to.  +music
Don't you get it?+P+Jeez, I feel like it's the 70's again; defending McCartney:  To anyone who doesn't get it: his solo work is not the Beatles. He never seemed to care as much about lyrics and "meaning", as opposed to John and George, but focused on great melody, harmony, and catchy, if sometimes almost meaningless, lyrics. No one seemed to mind when he did it with The Beatles......... All amazing. This album may be his best; simple songs, simply recorded, heartfelt. His tunes and lyrics can be deceptively simple ( Junk, Man we was Lonely ) but listen closely to what he's saying. He doesn't shove your face in how he feels, unlike Lennon's "How do You Sleep" or even Ringo's "Boogaloo". This album is the first glimpse we all got into who did what in the Beatles and, as basic as it is, opens a new door. Still on my top ten+music
The soul is "grande"+P+Sweet Surrender!!! that's the song that got me into bying this album, and what a album! On "move with me" he takes me on a ride in the same vibe as the stones have. "Get on top" equally great with his sex frustrated voice in peak condition. The flow on "Hong Kong Bar" is simulair to the feeling you get from the doors "riders on the storm" and closing Make it right is dramatic as few. There is a few not so brilliant songs but mixed up with these mindblowers that just dosent matter...If you love Jeff then learn to love..+music
A nice (mainly) trad album!+P+A nice later album from this all-star, all-gal trad band.  On this album, the Ladies bring in various members of their families to perform alongside the ensemble...The Longs, Maddens, Clancys, et al., pitch in, and show where the group's trad roots come from.  Other than a horrendous  version of Dan Fogelberg's '70s AOR neolith, &quot;The Leader Of The Band,&quot; this is a great album.  (I &quot;get&quot; the thematic tie between the lyrics and this album; I just can't stand the song and think it's really cheesy.)  Otherwise, this disc has an admirable mix of instrumentals and ballads, and Joannie Madden's piping is, as ever, a heavenly aural treat.  Recommended+music
An interesting change+P+This is different from most classical and instrumental cd's I have. It is neat to hear the euphonium showcased. You can tell that Adam Frey has a great sense of humor, the album art is fabulous! The album has a great variety, Flight of the Bumblebee is fantastic!  I highly recommend this cd for anyone who wants a little something different in their classical collection+music
Words cannot express+P+Where to begin? To put it as briefly as possible, if you're an adventurous music listener you will not be disappointed by Blueberry Boat. This is the most inventive work I've heard since Radiohead's Kid A. (No small feat). Every style you could imagine is carefully melded into one, including the most wonderfully bizzare lyrics I have ever heard. No sense discussing every track ad nauseam, each individual will form their own opinions. I can only give this my highest and most urgent recommendation.  Pay no mind to the impatient simps who give this album one star and call it "the worst of all time." Sit down with Blueberry Boat; listen to it as many times as you have to. Those who *get* this musical gift from the Friedbergers will fall in love. Give it a chance and you may be pleasantly surprised+music
Monster 80's Volume 2+N+I was going to order this, having ordered Volume 1 of the same title, when I noticed that this has a track on it that is ALSO on Volume 1, &quot;Goody Two Shoes&quot; by Adam Ant.  Why in the world would anyone publish a 2nd Volume of a CD set and include a duplicate track on it???  RIP OFF+music
A Lite Confectionary +N+Having been a Glass fan since Music in 5 Parts and a R. Shankar fan for even longer, I eagerly anticipated this collaboration.  Individually, both Glass and Shankar challenged my listening in many directions.  When Passages finally arrived, it was a real disappointment. This work challenged only my patience and ability to stay awake.    Every two years or so I give it another listen to see if a new perspective emerges.  It doesn't+music
Make up your mind Tina!!+N+My gosh!! Tina had made 2 cd's of All The Best is a waste of money on Tina Turner. Don't take us wrong we do fond of her but why would she made 2 times of All The Best?! About the same as En Vogue!! It's not worth on buying this one because it only has 18 songs in this cd!! So think twice!! the best cd's you could get is 2 sets of cd of All The Best it has over 25 songs in it it would save you alot of money from buying these 2 cd's for once tho... just my opinion!! Honestly for this cd we would give 1 star but the other one of All The Best that has 2 sets of cd's and has over 25 songs in it we would for sure give 5 stars for that one!+music
Great CD+P+It's one of those cd's that makes you bounce and makes the holiday season more enjoyable. Boney James is good... period+music
38 Special stomps!+P+the guys in this band have a sound with size-12 shoes. if you like this band, I suggest you try the Allman Bros., Lynyrd Skynyrd, and Creedence Clearwater Revival. standout tracks are Rockin Into the Night, Hold On Loosely, Wild-eyed Southern Boys, Fantasy Girl, Caught Up In You, If I'd Been The One, Back Where You Belong, and Like No Other Night. the question is: where is this band? it's awesome. they need to make a comeback.+music
The Warning:  Don't buy this+N+I randomly chose to buy and listen to this CD because they are playing at Coachella.  It isn't good.  It reminds me of StereoLab but without talent.  Each song is more insipid and boring than the last.  The music is an unfortunate combination of beats from a dated drum machine, irritating electonic blips, guitar for beginners and vocal stylings that are wimpy and heartless.  Needless to say...I don't get it+music
Dan The Automator ruins it.+N+Galactic decided to go with a big-name producer named Dan the Automator.  Dan the Automator took an amazing, explosive, quirky funk sound and gutted it of any soul it had.  I'm sure these songs sound good live, that is without Dan the Automator's overproduction and mixing (Drum machines over Stanton Moore?  For shame!  The horror!).  The album itself is flat except for a few high points - "Paint" is good, "The Beast" is funky enough, "Never Called You Crazy" is good, and "All Behind You Now" is a great song, or would be live.  That's about it.  The rest of the album varies from so-so to outright boring, and considering the amazing amount of talent Dan the Automator had to work with in Galactic that's a crime.    Crazyhorse Mongoose and Late for the Future are both far superior records+music
This band is horrible.+N+Being the fan of the Rolling Stones I picked up this CD thinking it was  something similar. Well they do try to emulate the stones sound but fail  miserably.  They have no originality or heart in their music who ever lets  them make CDs should be forced to listen to it.  If you buy this you are  either a masochist or an idiot+music
Krayzie Bone rips rap a new a$$...+P+I saw this album when it first came out back in '99, but do to some hard times and a lot of other b/s, i never got around to buying it until the summer of 2004. I am huge Bone fan, they are the group that got me into rap, and i'm into much rap, look at my reviews and you'll see that i am metal head, but i love the bone!!! Layzie and Krayzie are my favorites, followed by Wish and Flesh then Bizzy. I like all of the members, but i love Layzie and Krayzie's delivery and lyrics. So after i finally got around to buying this double disck collektion, i was really amazed at the material on here.  First off, i'll admit that i don't like every track, but i'm a white metal head so what do you expect? but the tracks i do like, i really feel and appreciate them. The moods this album can put me through are really amazing. One minute you can be feeling the fire from heated heavy, where my thugz at, thug alwayz, silent warrior, shoot the club up,world war. Then the next moment you can be feeling some more mellow beats but at the same time it's still cold blooded murda mo going on on tracks like murda mo, try me,thug mentality, these dayz. but there are even more mellow tracks too like Paper, Smokin Budda, That's The Way, won't ez up tonight. This album is really awesome, Krayzie tears up all the tracks, i love how his flow can go from mellow, to angry, to smoothe laid back sounding. Here's all the tracks that i like off this album and a rating for each.  1.Thug Invasion-An excellent intro 2.Heated Heavy-Krayzie's flow is lightining fast and as tight as ever. 10 3.Paper-A nice mellow track, awesome beat that keeps the song interesting. 10 4.Payback Is A Bitch-This song really makes me want to shoot some bitches up!-9 5.Dummy Man-haha, scandolous ass Krayzie! 9 6.Drama-I actaully like this song,it's really true that the b/s never stops. 8 7.World War-tight track-8 When I Die-i actually like this track, no one else seems to agree that is fire! 9 8.Thug Alwayz-Krayzie,Layzie,Flesh, and Wish tear it up! Awesome beat! 10 9.Thug Mentality-I like how he nakes off all the places, nice beat and lyrics. 9 10.Murda Won't Stop-tight ass intro-10 11.Where My Thugz At-Another tight-ass track-9 12.Try Me-i read a lot reviews that said this song was filler, but listen to the lyrics and you'll see why he wrote this song. 9 13.These Dayz-This song has some awesome lyrics and a great beat! listen to all of the versus lyrics! 10 14.Silent Warrior-This song is the fire!!! 10 15.Shoot the Clup up-Love this track! 10 16.Won't Ez Up-9 17.That's The Way-Awesome laid back track-10 18.Murda Mo-Love this track!! Krayzie tears it up!! 10  I highly recommend this to any Bone fan, this will really compliment your kollecktion!!+music
Ultimate Christmas Album+P+Mariah Carey's 1994 album Merry Christmas is the ultimate Christmas album.  She breathes new life into standard songs like Silent Night and Joy to the World.  Her voice is in peak form, hitting her five octave range - and I swear for this album - six.    On this new release, one side is a CD, the other has all her charming Christmas music videos.  The label warns that the CD side will not play in all CD players unless it is a Sony, but it played fine in my non-Sony CD walkman as well as my Gateway PC DVD player.    There are two engaging secular songs here, "All I Want for Christmas is You," and "Baby Please Come Home for Christmas."  But the real power is in the classic hymns and carols.  Her versions are so full of joy and reverence for Jesus our Saviour.  I get tears in my eyes when I think of the Christ Child coming to Earth - the real reason for Christmas+music
A BIT OF A DISAPPOINTMENT+N+HOLD THE FAITH: With his debut album release, VIRTUOUS WOMAN, Warrior King cemented a reputation as one of Jamaica's hottest conscious singers in recent years. Singles like NEVER GO WHERE PAGANS GO and VIRTUOUS WOMAN bust up the Jamaican charts, and established young Warrior King as a major talent with strong vocal range, delivering cultural as well as lovers' lyrics for some of the island's biggest producers. In light of such a powerful debut, HOLD THE FAITH turns out to be a bit of a disappointment. The album opens with an interesting introductory segment, and then the title track, which is decent but nothing to run out into the streets and shout about. From thereon out, HOLD THE FAITH rides a few crests - like the herbally inspired MEDITATION on the PASS THE KUTCHIE (FULL UP) rhythm, or the catchy sing-along, EDUCATION - but mostly hovers right around average, or at worst, sinks to sadly uninspired. Listening to forgettable roots-by-numbers efforts like FREEDOM and JUDGMENT DAY, there's little evidence that this is the work of the same singer whose compelling chanting style carried a modern classic like POWER TO CHANT to the top every reggae playlist. Even worse, there are a couple of performances - particularly the dreadful EVERYDAY - that sound like phone-ins; a real let-down, and not at all what you'd expect from an artist of Warrior King's caliber. Overall, I really believe that HOLD THE FAITH is just a misstep, and that if we can indeed hold the faith, Warrior King will be back to reward us with his very best before too long. Until then, this will just have to do+music
Ridiculously Awesome+P+Just buy it. You will thank me later. One of the most incredible recordings in musical history. Anything by Lemon Jelly is special and Lemonjelly.ky is also out of this world so why not buy them both?  If I could give this CD 100 stars I would+music
A Joy to Hear!+P+Most people are familiar with at least Rhapsody 2 from watching Warner Brothers' cartoons, if for no other reason. That delightful piece is included but there is so much more! This is a wonderful album to enjoy.  Among my favorites is the short but delightful number 11 in A minor. It is a joy to hear but, then again, all of these are.  Do not expect orchestral arrangements. This is for the piano by itself.  Listen and enjoy!+music
A Beautiful Job+P+The last great American operetta of the 1920s, this masterpiece by Sigmund Romberg and Oscar Hammerstein is given a loving performance by the cast of the 2004 New York City Center Encores production, including Christiane Noll, Rodney Gilfrey, Lauren Ward, Burke Moses, and Peter Benson. This is the only available recording of the complete score, including "Marianne," "The Girl On the Prow," "Softly, As In a Morning Sunrise," "Stouthearted Men," "One Kiss"  and "Lover, Come Back to Me." What a treat!+music
backround music+N+When I bought this I was looking forward to the blending of the flute and the harp. I have Wind Songs and some Hilary Stagg and other harp music  in my collection. This CD dissapointed me. The flute is much louder than the harp and when I turned up the volume to hear the harp the flute became too shrill for my ears. My second letdown is that there is no passion or emotion in the performance. It sounds like some musicians playing sheet music for money. The musicians are very good technically, but they are performing music that they did not choose or compose and their lack of emotional commitment seems evident. Michael Hoppe wrote the music but he does not perform on any of the songs. The liner notes say that this is music to play in the background while having diner. Maybe that is what it is intended for, it's just not what I was looking for+music
overblown &quot;artistic freedom&quot;+N+Atlantic Records sure must be loose w/ their recording contracts. I don't see how this kind of drivel, regardless of the musicians' past records and reputations, could pass a demo test w/ stingy studio execs.  This CD was  simply self-indulgent and wasteful.  Froom is incapable of just playing  keyboards, w/out trying to overunderproduce a piece to the point of  absurdity.  Atmospheric just don't cut it if there's no compelling content  to hold it up.  And where's that killer guitar talent we know/knew in  Hidalgo?  Just a strange, disjointed, and goofy effort with no real payoff+music
Will Calm My Baby if it Doesn't Drive her Crazy First+N+My daughter needs to have music playing when she sleeps. That's just a fact because we in a house in the city. This is the weirdest cd I have ever heard. It doesn't really stop her from crying but it does sometimes put her in this weird daze. It does not help her sleep, in fact, it keeps her from sleeping and after a while, she is agitated until I turn it off. I'd say if you don't normally play music for your baby she or she may fall for this. I'd recommend just playing any CD that you currently own on repeat mode during naps. The point of playing music is so that when a baby re-enters the light sleep phase, normal sounds in the home don't startle and awaken her. If you feel that you must buy something specifically for your baby to hear, I recommend Woody Guthrie "Nursery Days" for your baby. It has become the soundtrack of our lives.+music
takes u to the time when u thought milli vanilli was actually singing(sic!)+N+this is the type of cookie cutter crappy late eighties dreck that was played on a lot of radio stations at the time. although, cheesy as it is now, definitely takes you back to a time and place, abeit, a very cheesy time and place. anybody still growing their mullet!(sic!+music
Timeless+P+Probably one of the top 20 rock albums of the past 20 years, I still consider this to be Pearl Jam's best album to date. Possibly even Pearl Jam's career defining album, which is unusual for a band to be at the absolute peak of their game on releasing their debut.  Penned and sung by Eddie Vedder, without a doubt one of rocks great vocalists, this album has a fair few of PJ's best-loved tracks.  If you're relatively new to Pearl Jam's music, I would recommend you buy either this release or their greatest hits album, 'rearviewmirror: Greatest hits 1991-2003'.  Fan favourites on this album are "Jeremy", "Alive", Even Flow" and "Black". Some tracks I rate highly would be "Alive", "Garden", "Jeremy" and "Release".  Still, if you don't fancy buying the album, at least download some of the tracks I mentioned. You won't be dissapointed.  If you're a fan of Pearl Jam you might also like The Smashing Pumpkins, Soundgarden, Audioslave, Alice in Chains, Stone Temple Pilots or even Nirvana. If you like this record I would highly recommend listening to 'Siamese Dream' by The Smashing Pumpkins, or 'Superunknown' by Soundgarden, which is apparently one of Eddie Vedder's favourite albums+music
Pleased+P+I have this and the 2000 Hawaiian Slack Key Christmas cut.  Both are fabulous but if you had to choose one, I'd favor the 1996 cut for the sweet, mellow sound...  the old style+music
From a Barry Manilow fan...+N+Warning:  some of the songs listed on the box are abbreviated versions and should be listed as such.  They fade out half way thru the song.  I was very disapointed.   Would be much better in chronological order.  It is in some places, but then jumps around for no apparent reason.   It seems like Barry attempted to show what a talented entertainer he is, and he is very talented.  It is just this box set tries to do too many things, and accomplishes nothing.  It just tries too hard.   +music
Rivers run dry+N+Don't buy it.  If you can get Carpet Man on another collection, do so.  He's better off not trying to be hip because he is not.  I purchased this for historical purposes, but if you ever wonder about pop idols trying to be hip, Tommy Roe did a little better with Winter's Day+music
Two great collaborators two Geniuses+P+Waller and Armstrong were of the same generation and were collaborators in music in the 1920s. Louis's first big leap to popular stardom beyond the tight group of Jazz musicians and performers came when he introduced "Ain't Mis Behavin'" on the Broadway stage. The audiences often forced him to do three or four encores.  Folks who had seen the show before would pay full price just to get in to hear Louis sing this one song.     The recordings in the late 20s by Louis with all the vocals are simply my idea of the best music ever recorded by anyone. Rather than get them selected this way, you might want to get one of the CDs or collections that covers that period of time with everything, rather than just the songs by Waller.   Likewise, while the All Stars were not as good as his original Chicago and New York Groups, particularly these later all-stars (I prefer the albums with the great Jack Teagarden), if you get into the music you will want that all too.       At any rate, there is no one else but Louis who can do these songs justice except the Fat man himself, Mr. Waller+music
Billy becomes a star with his first hit album+P+This album PIANO MAN put Billy Joel on the map, even though his COLD SPRING HARBOR album was also excellent, but didn't get very much distribution originally. Of course "Piano Man" is one of my favorite pop/rock tunes in the history of music, but really this whole album is superb, and there's not one bit of filler on this one. Of course "The Ballad of Billy The Kid" is classic Billy Joel, and the same with "Captain Jack". The rest of this album isn't excellent but Very Good. Billy just couldn't do any wrong during his 70's heyday, and this was just basically the beginning of his huge success. Billy was probably the best pop/rock songwriter of the 70's, and the material on this album happens to be some of his best compositions. In short Billy flat out rocks, so rush out to your music stores and buy this gem of an album.+music
Jane Eyre: The Musical from an Theater Fan's Perspective+P+Before I tell you all my opinion about this musical, I would like to comment that my recording is slightly different than the one here online. My is the original Canadian Cast. The cover has a gnarled tree against a blazing sunset on it...very interesting. For the most part though, the songs are the same. Some things have been added, taken out, or modified. Anyway, I got mine at a flee market and couldn't wait to listen because I was a fan of the famous book. I listened and was slightly disappointed with it. Marla Schaffel (I might have spelled her name wrong) has a gorgeous voice and plays the part of Jane very, very well. I haven't heard the man who plays Mr. Rochester on this recording; I have only heard Anthony Crivello portray him. Although the cast matters a good deal, in this musical's case, I believe the score and lyrics count a tiny bit more. Some songs are truly disgraceful, however, there are several that stand out. My favorites include 'As Good As You', 'Painting My Portrait', 'Secret Soul', and 'In the Light of the Virgin Evening'. I would probably have more favorites if I had heard this recording...unfortunately I haven't had the pleasure to hear 'The Orphan', 'Sirens', 'Finer Things', or 'Rain'. The music is over all very good once you become accustomed to it. The real quality that stands out in this musical are the lyrics. Lyrically, this play is absolutely brilliant. Even if you ignore the music and the voices...just listen to the words and you will most certainly be moved. Being that Jane Eyre is adapted from a novel, I expected that the lyrics would be predictable and insipid...everything they are not. Over all, I can enjoy this play for not only the musical wonder, but the breathtaking lyrics. Thanks to those of you who took the time to read my review! Do any of you viewers agree+music
Excellent - but no substitute for seeing them live!+P+I love this album. If you are a jam band fan you will love this CD/album. Some one I know thought it sounded a lot like the Grateful Dead when I played it for them. I bought this CD after seeing them for the first time live. They are a great band and are very "together" with their sound. Found this CD addictive and never seem to get tired of it. GREAT BUY!   I only put 4 out of 5 stars because they are still better live than the CD.+music
A Disappointing and Naive take on House or Electronic Music+N+I had read the reviews of this album and picked it up on the strength of the positive comments, but I was shocked at how terrible this album was.  Understanding Herbert's classical piano background, I expected a deep and nuanced interpretation of house that could combine interesting danceable beats with a solid 4x4 backbone, but some rhythmic variation and interesting found sounds from the claims of so many odd samples used.  The first thing that put me off was the terrible vocals, which combine the cheesy and trite lyrical stylings of the worst diva-house with the shallow wording of your local folk music open mic.  The rhythms were also boring, none of the more interesting layering ontop of the standard house beat, but a very shallow and superficial interpretation you would expect to find on a Casio keyboard.    Stay away+music
Very very very nice+P+This cd is light hearted and FUN+music
Fun and nostalgic!+P+I definitely would recommend adding this CD to your ecclectic collection. It summarizes cowboy music and the cowboy mentality which I feel I have a little bit of. Extremely good for the confirmation of being single- it's  okay to be alone+music
Everytime I hear This I cannot believe it's not HUGE!!!!+P+I am a 34 year old Real Estate agent who used to own a Dance Club.... Think 10 years ago going to school... My personal leanings musically are more 80's dance and new wave... I got into the Gin Blossoms, Toad The Wet Sprocket, Origin stuff in the early 90's but when Nirvana changed the style of mainstream music I sort of dropped out... Went to dance music and there wasnt much of it... These past few years as I was busy with a family and real job I have not payed much attention but about a year ago I found Synthpop and www.adifferentdrum.com and www.slothradio.com aside from the synthopop and Blank and Jones type stuff I have been listening to I also have liked a lot of the teen-i-bopper music out latley... really top fourtyish as it has a dancable beat and the best writers seem to have gone that direction for the money.... K thats a long intro for why this album BLOWS me away... I have all this stuff playing in my office to keep me and my staff pumped all the time and whats wierd is we have this server (iTunes) where everyone can choose from 90 gigs woths of music and with iTunes you can keep track of number of plays. In the past 3 months with probably 100 new CDs in the server in that time this one is on top of all of them with the Killers coming in second. Its sort of dark, but energy filled, INCREDIBLE vocals and it really makes you want to dance. Please... check out the different mixes of+music
Lacking outstanding track selection+N+as always, the dutchman comes through with quality mixxing talent. unfortunately for me, i felt there was a lack for outstanding musical selection.  i didnt feel like there were any outstanding tracks... nothing with a unique and outstanding rhythm. i like progressive mixes, but i have to say this mix didn't progress to anything outstanding.  +music
Can't figure out a song+N+Alright, the song I am looking for is when the group is in Copenhagen I believe?  Cooper goes off by himself to the local Sex Club, where they proceed to have all sorts of fun with him.  I am looking for the song that plays in that scene.  Its not very long, and its in German, but it sounded vaguely familiar.  I have had no other luck finding it, so I thought I would ask here.  Thanks, ~dash+music
Just for laughs, a little dissention...+N+I bought this LP when it first came out.  I'd drowned my happy soul in "Out of the Cool" and got lost for months in the moods of "Individualism".  Add to that his "Guitar Forms" LP with Kenny Burrell and the "Sketches" album, I was ready for more of the pure Evanescence, and not ready for Gil Evans to do what most self-respecting composers do -- shift gears.  No, change cars.  In mid-drive.    This album was a huge change to me, and I tried to follow him but couldn't.  Kind of like trying to follow  Stravinsky from his neo-classical phase to his atonal phase.  Maybe he (Gil Evans) made it, maybe the other reviewers are right, and it's all great stuff, but it lost me.  No magic, no startles, no surprises that I could suck into my soul and thrive on.    So, be warned, be cautious.  It's a change, and it signals a change that he continued on for the rest of his career, and if you loved "Individualism", you might not make the jump.  Then again, maybe you will.  I just have to go on record to say all this, as one Evans fan who is disappointed+music
Joe Cocker And Leon Russell Create A Hot Roadshow+P+Joe Cocker teams up with Tulsa native Leon Russell and a cast of over forty for a concert tour, and what a party! The live set contains a mix of Russell compositions and blues/R&amp;B/pop/rock standards, all performed with the feral intensity of a man possessed. It's clear that the magic couldn't last in this form, and it didn't, although Cocker did go on to make many fine records, and even some great ones, after his jaunt with Russell+music
Ladies and Gents....+N+It doesn't get any worse than this. If you have any doubts as to whether Def Jazz is "worth" the trouble-- don't bother. To even call this repulsive mess Jazz is a slap in the face to a genre that has stood fine on it's own without the help of so called fusion Rap/Jazz albums. To the reviewer who named this the best Jazz album ever:     SHAME ON YOU!!!!!!+music
Waylon Jennings Sings Hank Williams+N+This was a great disappointment. Waylon must have been in the bathroom and the muscians in the lounge when this recording was made! I love Waylon Jennings but the vocals are so distorted and the music so loud that it was very hard to tell who was singing. I'm sure if the recording had of been better quality I would have loved this+music
Nothing More Than A Bootleg Of Poor Quality+N+My feelings are very mixed on the live performance by 2Pac. But in the end, I feel it is a CD that should be avoided unless you absolutely need everything issued under 2Pac's name.   The sound quality is terrible; it would not rate well if being issued as a bootleg. The CD starts off with a Live Medley, but drops in about the middle of California Love. Even the most idiotic bootlegger would not make such a mistake.  If you decide to continue listening, it is probably because there is a dearth of live material by 2Pac that has found its way to CD. But because of that, why would something of such poor quality be the best for a commercial release?   And at the end of the 40 or so minutes, it becomes obvious...Suge Knight was trying one more time to cash in on 2Pac's legacy before his label became totally insignificant.  The CD does not have the Amaru logo on it, meaning that Afeni Shakur did not approve the release. But Knight's name is written in bold letters anywhere it can fit.  After taking it all in, Knight should have done 2Pac's fans a favor and just made an appeal for donations on the Internet.  +music
atrocious and soulless+N+I don't know what you people are talking about. This album is horrendous. Terrible, Peter-Frampton-cum-Boston arrangements of Velvets songs. The guitar tones alone are enough to make me want to scream.  This is not rock, nor is it animalistic. For anyone who loves this album, I recommend doing drugs. Or having some soul+music
Yawn.+N+Nickel Creek fans, obviously, will love this syrupy solo album by the guitarist of the aforementioned famed popgrass fusion band.  Presumably this mostly-instrumental outing is intended to demonstrate Watkins' chops as a picker, yet it follows so closely in the saccharine tradition of Nickel Creek that it doesn't do much to differentiate his work from theirs.  The album opens with &quot;Neo's Song,&quot; which sounds like a watered-down version of Tony Rice's note-bending flatpicking style; the rest of the album gets progressively muzak-ier and Windham Hill-ish.  Watkins has lots of technical facility, but his artistic instincts are hopelessly bland+music
Wrong CD Listed Online+N+I bought this CD thinking it was the 2 CD set I saw in the commercial, and I was wrong.  It is a single CD with only half of what the TV version has+music
arg+N+All I have to say is this cd is not comprised of ballads.  It really frustrates me how stupid these ad guys are.  Ballad--A ballad is a story, usually a narrative or poem, in a song. Any story form may be told as a ballad, such as historical accounts or fairy tales in verse form. It usually has foreshortened, alternating four- and three-stress lines ('ballad meter') and simple repeating rhymes, often with a refrain.  If it is based on political or religious themes, a ballad may be a hymn. It should not be confused with the ballade, a 14th and 15th century French verse form.  Some good examples of ballads: The Devil Went Down to Georgia, The Ballad of Jesse James, Johnny Has Gone For a Soldier, Ode to Billie Joe  While there are a couple of songs on this album that are actual ballads, the large majority are not.  The same goes with that Monster ballads cd with all the bad eighties hair metal/pop rock+music
not really a review as much as a....+P+i was asked once what my favorite pavement songs were...     there are some pavement songs which fit certain moods *perfectly*, and at those times, i don't have a choice but to count them as my favorites. for instance...i was in new york a few springs ago, spending the evening with the girl i'd had a brief-yet-effective romance with the summer before. she was there with a guy; i was there with two other girls, mutual friends. the five of us were in an underground, literal-hole-in-the-wall-type bar, tucked away inside a subway station at 50th street (i think). the bar was called siberia, and was a total punk/russian (prussian?) paradise. every light bulb was red, and there was writing on every inch of the walls and tables. the lone bathroom stall had a gaping three foot hole busted out of the wall on one side, through which you could see only blackness. the sofas had long ago collapsed on their stumpy legs and fallen to the sticky floor, where they laid dejected and off-balance. cushions were missing and the beer was extremely expensive. i got drunk and watched her...got drunk on the beer and the nostalgia both, pressed myself into a musty corner of the couch, and after a while, closed my eyes. there was a jukebox. it was the brightest and biggest thing in the whole place. it had &quot;crooked rain, crooked rain&quot; in it. i played &quot;fillmore jive,&quot; wallowed in its brilliant decadence...i played it again then got up and roamed around manhattan for 5 hours. alone and happy.     that night, &quot;fillmore jive&quot; was my favorite pavement song+music
A Greatest Hits Masterpiece+P+A lot if not most greatest hits collections have some hits and some padding.Not this album.This is one great collection.The five songs tacked on at the end made this album a must own masterpiece.If you like Al Green's 70's output,you WILL like this CD.Every single song is a classic.Ol Skool Al Green fans (like myself) might already have at least a couple of his albums already,but this CD sums up why he's soul legend.   P.S.:Do yourself a favor and pick up some of his 70's era albums starting with "I'm Still In Love With You" if you haven't already+music
Cube's 3rd solo is nother good one+P+Not his best album, not his worst, The Predator seems to fall right in the middle.  It came out just one year after his last album and 2 years after his debut (right after he left N.W.A.), so alot of Cube albums came out from '90-'93 (one each year).  It has 12 songs, and no guests so alot of Ice Cube gets heard here.  It has 1 classic, 2-4 I skip, 3-5 are ok, and the others are good.  Production is good for iots time buy you can tell it's defintiely from the early 90's.  DJ Pooh does 4 songs, Muggs does 3, Sir Jinx does 2, and Pockets, Mr. Woody and Torcha Chamba all do 1 song.  Every song samples an older song so it's not the most original of beats but the samples are mostly good.  For fans of Cube or early 90's political type gangsta rap pick it up.   #2 - 8 #4 - 5 #5 - 8 (nice beat) #6 - 5 #7 - 10 (CLASSIC -- great relaxing beat sampling the Isley's -- maybe his best song ever) #8 - 7 #10 - 8 #11 - 6.5 #12 - 6 #13 - 8 #14 - 7 (has a 1 minute intro before rapping starts) #16 - 6  O'Shea Jackson -- b. 6/15/69  check all my review+music
Good+P+I ecpecialy like the song Dirty Boots and Kool Thing but the rest of the album is great too+music
Live is best+N+This Was Joe Walsh in his Prime, when he was really Rockin' If your A james Gang fan, and you like live music, you really should own this "CD"!  (Joe at some of his best!!!)+music
Music from your bone marrow+P+The other reviewers are spot-on exact about the loveliness of this music.  I shall only add that I gave my copy away about 6 months ago but am only now replacing it -- the tunes are finally sounding a little worn and faded when I play them in my memory.  This music accompanies YOU after a while.  It is a quiet conversation with a much beloved friend, a silk scarf against the wind, a warm bowl of good soup on a damp chilly day.  Enjoy+music
Excellent+P+Great 80's sounding pop, but with a lot of 2006 uniqueness.  I love it+music
Great Cd... and a GREAT DEAL!+P+Leave it to cafe-ta to give its fans such a great deal on not only a wonderful cd, but also on an even greater dvd. This is a must have for all the cafe-ta fanatics... like myself. the dvd it great but i wish that it wasnt so edited. it seemed like they took a couple of concerts and edited them together... and sometimes not so discretely. towards the end of the dvd there are some scenes that cuts from them wearing one thing, to another and back again... all in the same song!... but other than that I LOVE IT... ive probably seen it about 50 times and ive had it for about 2 months! once again.. this is a must have for all CAFE-TA fanatics!!!+music
Mythodea+N+Absolutely superb album!!! I haven't stopped playing it for the last 3 days and I am quite fussy with what I like. All the tracks for this album are wonderful and just carry you away with emotion. Fantastic peice!+music
Come on people...+N+There is a reason why record companies who carry bands like Earth, Sunn 0))) and Teeth of Lions Rule the Divine ask very little for their albums: its nothing but noise. You would think that a band putting together three tracks adding up to well over 60 minutes of music would have something of worth on them. Well, don't expect it. Trying to make it through any of these band's work is like trying to sit through the film Shaoh without an intermission. Granted, I don't smoke weed, so I guess that leaves this music to those of you who aren't doing anything with your lives and who probably still play Dungeons & Dragons in your parents basement, while listening to the likes of Earth, Sunn 0))) and Teeth of Lions Rule the Divine. It just seems ironic and deeply sad that one must get blazed in order to like this "music". Drone metal was invented because the creators knew that there would be a massive following of losers just waiting to gobble up something that appeared to be visionary and original. I will admit, I have one drone metal album, Teeth of Lions Rule the Divine. I attained it because so many people on Amazon made this stuff sound as if it was the second coming of Christ. Please, do not waste your money. This is nothing but a novelty act that has long over stayed its welcome+music
Great Trio Work!!!+P+The fact no one has reviewed this title before now kind of surprises me.  This records highlight some great work by Monk, Max Roach, and Art Blakey; in addition, this record marks the first time most of these tunes were ever recorded, and there are some classics on here.  &quot;Trinkle, Tinkle&quot;, &quot;Blue Monk&quot;, &quot;Bemsha Swing&quot;, and &quot;Little Rootie Tootie&quot;(a lesser known but incredible tune) are all featured on this disc along with many other wonderful songs.  The particular version of &quot;Blue Monk&quot; that appears on this record represents a very memorable highmark.  It clocks in at 7:36 (the longest track on the record, most tunes are relatively short, preety much like the Blue Note period length wise) and features some awesome drum work by Blakey.  It is really great to hear Monk in a trio format, he really shines in this scenario.  I would definitely recommend this title to any Monk fan, or anyone wanting to start their Thelonious collection.  It really sets you up for Monk's &quot;original&quot; piano style+music
For those smart enough NOT to buy American Graffiti OST  +P+This compilation has nearly all the tracks from American Graffiti's soundtrack, and so much more. This is exactly what I've been looking to fit my eclectic taste. All the hits are here, this side of Great Balls of Fire and Willie and the Hand Jive. Those two would have made this compilation perfect, but perfection is hard to come by when dealing with era compilations.   I wasn't around back when these songs were blasting on the radio, but I grew up listening to this music - thanks, mom! If you want to experience the sound of this era, this three-set cd collection is perfect. I've been looking for Maybellene, Be-Bop-A-Lula, Peggy Sue, Sea Cruise and Blue Suede Shoes and they're all here on the same set!  Try ebay before you buy here. I found this set relatively cheap over there. There were about five sellers when I bought mine, all vying for the lowest price.    This is great road music for those of you in my generation brave enough to try something new and break away from the Death Cab for Cutie/Outkast conformity we hear all the time on mainstream radio.   For those of you who grew up on this stuff, please let me reintroduce you to your old friends. This cd has almost all of them.+music
What the Hell is going on!+N+I'm very confused.  Rap has turned to garbage in the blinking of an eye.  I got all Suave House c.d.'s and this ain't the Eightball and MJG I know.  It's only about 4 tight cuts on here.  The rest of them are garbarge.  The title of the Album is one of the worst songs on here.  I don't know why they got Swizz Beatz to touch this album but he didn't do it any justice.  His beats sound just like every thing else he does except worse.  DJ Quik produced a couple of cuts on here to but there just as worse.  The chores on just about all the songs are tired and plain.  This album is to damn slow and soft!  It's not a single song on this album to get you hype like Coming Out Hard and On Top of the World.  Even the lyrics are boring.  I don't know what happened between them and T-Money but they need to hook back up with him quick, before its to late.  I feel like I'm in a contract.  I have all there albums so I gotta keep buying them.  If you decide to buy one of there albums for the first time, don't buy this one! Garbage!  First Jay-z's last album, Wu-tang's last album, and now this.  Makes me want to break my foot off in somebody+music
Linda -- what have you done?+N+This is definately NOT the Linda Ronstadt that I have loved listening to for the past 30 years!  I have been a Ronstadt fan since the early 70s.  Loved her Nelson Riddle big band stuff, her Tucson Sessions album with Emmylou Harris, and just picked up her "Frenesi" album and love it too.  But this... This is definately not the album to showcase her vocal talents.  I could not even finish listening to it.  The last CD I will buy without previewing the songs first.  Skip it.+music
completely thrilled me and surprised me!+P+Usually i'm not the greatest Gloria Estefan fan, but this cd utterly won me over!  I'm not a super english Gloria Estefan fan, but her spanish cd's have captivated my heart.  When i decided to buy this cd, i was waiting for your typical dance music.  I was really glad to hear good spanish music because now a days we lack that.  Every time i hear it (whether i'm doing homework, easy listening, or reading)I want to be Cuban (de la patria) and dance salsa forever!  She moves me-if not her, then definitely her music/orchestra.  Beautifully arranged, perfect timing, and a glorious attack of Cuban beat/rhythm/love/spice/energy!!!  After this cd, i bought all her other spanish cd's immediately (like Mi Tierra and Abriendo Puertas) but nonetheless, this cd (Alma Caribena) beats them all! :+music
Incredibly bad+N+I have several of Mr. Thompson's cd's which I like, but this one is really bad.  Imagine listening to relaxing music, but some kid is at your stereo playing with the balance control, making everything go all in your left ear, then all in your right ear, then back and forth randomly.  After 10 minutes I couldn't take it anymore.  Someone else might find that relaxing, but I most certainly did not+music
Why do these songs have the wrong artist names?+N+Why do I keep finding that most of the theme songs are written by different artists on other albums?  Clubbed For Death was done by Crystal Method, and I know that for sure because it's on their album+music
Could be better+P+Ministry's "Bad Blood" is the best song on the whole album. But could have added some techno like, Orbital, Aphex Twin, Chemical Brothers, And Fatboy Slim.    They should have added "Come to Daddy (pappy mix)" to the album. Or maybe "Head Like a Hole+music
ridiculously good+P+These 1969 double disc live cd's...  I didn't like VU until I heard these cd's.  The versions of lisa says and sweet jane on here make later recordings of the same songs sound completely inferior.  It's like a totally different band on these discs+music
Whale sounds+N+This music is pretty intelligent, but not very interesting. The forgettable melodies hardly connect with the complex rhythm lines; on only one or two occasions on the cd satisfying harmonies come across.   I bought this together with Nitin Sawhney's "Beyond Skin", which is an incomparably better cd - Sawhney plugs in nicely with earlier work from Portishead, Hooverphonic, and even the Roots. Karsh Kale however, seems to pay tribute to Jean Michel Jarre's "Waiting for Cousteau".  During yoga, my teacher wallpapers her lesson with a whale sounds-cd. When I do yoga at home, Karsh Kale is a neat substitute for that+music
Not great, not bad+N+I listened to cd and I dont know how to explain this cd. I cant really explain to well I guess, but i'll try. The problem I had was the swearing. I usually dont have a problem with swearing, but the way this band did it ruined the cd. It seemed like every other word in the songs are F$%*. It sounded like they tried to damn hard to impress the youth by doing this. The cd held nothing speical at all, not what I really wanted to hear in a metal cd. If you want really inspiring music go and listen to a Hatebreed cd. This cd is alright, but the swearing was so stupid and out of place. HA! Thats what I meant to say, the swearing just seemed random and out of place. Thats what the problem with the cd was. Just add it here and there, not every other word. Probably would have been a better cd that way. To fans fo Throwdown, please do complain. Everyone has an opinion and that is mine.+music
Turn Around - Jonny Lang's newest CD+N+This is not up to par with his prior releases.  I did not care for his genre with this album.  I prefer his more bluesy music.  He has a greatvoice and is a fabulous musician, but this CD does not bring out either abilities.  It is a very average CD.  In fact, I cannot remember a single tune from it 20 minutes after listening to it.     I would like to see Jonny go back to the music that made him popular.  I don't believe that it would go against his new-found faith. +music
On the verge+P+I caught this band the other night on the PBS show "Austin City Limits". Every song they did was unique, and very well done. The song that really stuck in my head was the title track from this album, More Adventurous. I'm really a fan of jazz, but I can certainly recognize talent, and these guys are headed for the top+music
The New Powerfull Voice of LatinMusic--ANAIS!+P+I followed Anais from the TV show that discovered her "Objetivo Fama" and show after show,performance after performance,she was always the one to beat!   I always knew she would win the competition.  She is beautiful, has a strong & powerfull voice, great personality and a true talented STAR.   Her first CD just recently released "Asi Soy Yo" is a hit!  Her first single made popular by the great Ednita Nazario "Lo que Son Las Cosas" has been 4 weeks at #1 on Billboard Charts and the cd debut at #11...not bad for her first release....  I love the ballads "Que te Pedi" and also her reggaeton songs:  Sexo,Sexo and Suelta, they will in no time get to the top of the charts as well. I recommend this CD by Anais to anyone looking for a spanish album full of ballads & reggaeton. ANAIS IS HERE TO STAY!!!+music

CD Yes! Live Singing No!+P+After seeing Toni's show in my hometown Las Vegas,I was truly disappointed.  Toni's album is very good.  She leaves her personal problems out. However, her voice and personal problems were brought out too abruptly at the show!+music
Very disappointed...+N+This reissue could have been so much more. Firstly, the versions of several of these songs are markedly different from the original album, especially "I've Tried Everything." If they wanted to remix these songs, they should have just used them as bonus tracks! And the original album artwork is not here (the back shot of David Stewart is missing), as are the lyrics. And finally...these bonus tracks suck!!! They should have definately included the dance mix of 17 Again, which, here in the U.S., was the only hit version of that song!!! What a drag.+music
PURE FLUFF FOR THE BEACHCOMBERS!!  +N+With songs like "I'd Rather Ride Around With You" we know we're in for a nice beach ride!!  This is an inconsequential offering from Reba.  Just more "fluff" aimed at the teenage beach crowd.  Nothing to stand out here at all+music
What a disappointment+N+I don't understand all the raves for this CD, I was so disappointed when I listened to it.  I've always liked John Barry's film scores but in this re-recording all life has been drained out of the music.  Where's all the emotion, the excitement and pathos?  Instead, every track sounds the same -- they're all filled with a melancholic boredom.  Give me any of the original soundtracks over this &quot;easy-listening&quot; interpretation+music
"Desperately" poor song selection...+N+If this album had "Desperately" on it from "Stick It To Ya", I would've bought it in a second.  That's the best song on that album, a hidden gem that got a small amount of airplay nonetheless.  And with 8 tunes coming from that album (as well as 8 from its follow up "The Wild Life"), you would've thunk that "Desperately" would've made the cut over ho-hum songs like "She Wants More" or "You Are The One".  As such, skip this one, the songs from "The Wild Life" aren't that great anyway.  Get "Stick It To Ya" instead, it's a better best-of Slaughter collection than this one+music
Hip nostalgia+P+Martin Denny died last week.  The end of an era for me.  As a kid I would grab my father's vinyl LP's of Exotica and Quiet Village and transport myself to tropical lands beyond my dreams, listening to Denny's soothing sounds and exotic bird-call melodies.  Julius Wechtler on the vibes was one of my early favorites.  (I actually saw him, as leader of the Baja Marimba Band as the opening act for Wayne Newton!)  When all my little pals were buying LP's from some English group called the Beatles, I was kickin' it to Martin Denny.  This re-mastered double CD is a trip right back to those magical days in front of my parents "hi-fi"!  And without all of the snap-crackle-pop of the originals!  Awesome!!  As long as Martin Denny's music lives, so will he!!  Aloha, Mr. Denny!  And thanks for everything!  Keep a Mai Tai ready for me at that big Don the Beachcomber bar in the sky!+music
Another Winning Williams Film Score+P+Although he had written a number of film scores prior, John Williams  really began to score as a film composer with Star Wars.  Since then he has  composed a number of winning film scores, this score from Amistad certainly  being no exception.  As good as the film is, this music is good enough to  stand on its own and is worth the listen, even if one has not seen the  film+music
Another Williams masterpiece+P+If you watch--and listen to--enough movies, you can almost name the composer of certain scores, they're so similar.  John Barry's scores to &quot;Dances with Wolves,&quot; &quot;Out of Africa,&quot; and  &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; (except for the Rachmaninoff), are like that.   James Horner's scores are a little better differentiated.  But the two  best, able to write evocative scores that capture the essence of the film's  story and make us FEEL it--without leaving us thinking we've heard this  before--are Jerry Goldsmith (e.g., &quot;The Sandpebbles&quot;) and John  Williams.  Here, like Goldsmith's score to &quot;The Wind and the  Lion,&quot; Williams is able to take a truly exotic motif--the musical  forms of West Africa--and mix it with truly American, if a little  Copland-esqe-sounding, music.  And that's the whole idea.  People were  violently ripped from their homes and transported to, for them, a place no  less alien and bizarre than Africa was to white Europeans and Americans.   And yet the United States was a place that declared &quot;All men are  created equal.&quot;  The contemplative, high-principle-sounding music to  &quot;Mr. Adams Takes the Case,&quot; is as stirring as the exotic  &quot;Dry Your Tears, Afrika,&quot; but in a completely different way. That  John Williams is able to do that in score after score is what makes him one  of the all-time greatest in a genre that hasn't been around all that long.   My only wish is that film score composers would more often produce true,  symphonic suites from their film scores that can be played by orchestras as  stand-alone, concert pieces.  I hope this music becomes such a suite.  Like  the subject matter of the movie--the eternal human quest for freedom and  equality--it would become timeless+music
Love this cd!+P+This is my favorite cd of Vanessa-Mae's, and definitely the one you should buy first.  The pop/techno arrangements are very good, not cheesy and dated sounding like those on The Violin Player.  A must-have for anyone who enjoys the classical crossover genre+music
By Far the Best Group These Days+P+Good music is easy to come-by ... GREAT music is rare. What an incredible combination of talent Ritchie and Candy have! I've known of Ritchie of years, from his 'rock' days and always respected his talent. But Blackmore's Night is probably one of the most wonderful convergences of talents I've encountered. I wish I could say I listened to Blackmore's Night on purpose, but it was quite by accident. Nonetheless, I was enchanted enough to look into what they had done. I'll never regret it. They are unsurpassed in the music world these days. Candy's voice and lyrics and Ritchie's guitar ... it doesn't get any better+music
Best Disney Film Score+P+While I'm not always a big fan of the musical-esque style of Disney movies (although the kids love it, and that's what matters), Sleeping Beauty is one of the best orchestrated films I can remember.  George Bruns does a brilliant job of arranging Tchaikovsky's score from the Sleeping Beauty ballet.  The recording itself is decently remastered, and the small ensemble performing is excellent.  Mary Costa's vocals are flawless and almost supernatural.  If ever there were a disney soundtrack to own, this would be it+music
hubert sumlin rehash+N+I don't know what I was expecting from Hubert Sumlin. Surely not a rehash of some old Muddy Waters' and Willie Dixon chestnuts that were done correctly the first time with Muddy's voice and band. This album was a big dud. Sumlin takes the songs and tries to sing them and tries to make his band sound as if they were recording in the same style and sound as Chess Studio in the 1940's and 50's. Unfortunatley Muddy had a better voice and so does Willie Dixon for that matter. All the session men sound like add-ons to the old band, not muscicians who can bring their own style and verve to this thing. Pretty weak effort by all, unless Sumlin is himself to blame, as a control freak who did not have the vision to see what he was creating,something that had already been created 50 years before.  One redeeming quality of this cd is the final cut, an acoustic number that sounds as if some originality had been finally injected into the session. Sumlin is in need of an editor, or at least a confidant, who could have helped him with a better song selection or at least a better and more original way of handling these tunes.+music
Excellent+P+Being from Portland, the Wipers were a band I always knew about but somehow never actually saw. Their heyday in Portland ended right before I turned 21, to my eternal chagrin. Greg Sage is one of the great unkown rock stars of all time, bow down before him.   Kurt Cobain wanted to be Greg Sage. Think I'm full of it? Listen to the Nirvana cover of D-7 on the box set, listen to the original version of D-7 here and then consider the rest of Kurt's music in that light+music
I saw them Live+P+Wow on the reviews. They are much deserved.   I saw the Wipers live a number of times. Remember they formed in about 1977. So I wouldnt call them post punk, but maybe the first westcoast punk band.  The Nirvana connection is warrented, since Kurt Cobain was a big fan of the Wipers and saw many live shows.  I agree with the others, the Wipers arent a punk band. What is punk anyways. Im 44 and heard the Ramones in 1974, were they punk, no, they were pure Rock N Roll.  Greg Sage has a style that defines original.  Greg if you read this, I saw you a bunch of times at the Satyricon. Also some industrial part of Portland when the microphone hit you in the teeth. You missed about a half of sec, then kept singing.  Greg and the Wipers, thx for the memories.  Zenorecords.com  go to buy Greg and Wipers itmes.  BTW, Roky Erickson rocks. Check his music out also.+music
Letter from Satan+P+"Dear Gordon:  Remember the days when you showed such promise?  Before you sold me your soul in exchange for super-stardom? You, Andy & Stewart really concocted a rockin' brew of punk, jazz, funk, pop sensibility and, oh yeah, 'reggatta'.  Heh heh heh.  Well, as our bargin dictates, you owe me another Mercedes commercial.  Reminds me -- Phil Collins and the dude with the dreds from Counting Crows owe me another Disney soundtrack and Coke commercial, respectively.  Ciao, my little corporate huckster!  XOXO, Beelzebub.  PS - How's the whole Tantric thing working out?  Better make it 2 Mercedes commercials.+music
Sick Death-Core+P+I'll make this review short and sweet, because I'm feeling lazy today. Anyways I've had this CD for about 6 months and whenever I pop it in my mind is blown away, and my brains are thrown in a blender. These guys have two singers, and they both constantly switch off between different vocal styles, the brutal death style, the hardcore style, high pitched screams, and it blends together in a way that you will not be able to comprehend. One thing this band does not do is ever sing like a wussy, no emo garbage here. Basically if you think you're some big tough death-core kid because you listen to Premonitions of War, The Acacia Strain or The Red Chord, you don't know nothing until you've heard this. No disrespect to the latter three bands, they are some of my favorites, and some of the best live....but this CD is something else. Now come to Colorado, Despised Icon because I wanna see how much chaos you cause live. Buy this if you want to hear one of the heaviest bands in existenc+music
Recommended for insomniacs - but 5 stars for the title track+N+Sadly, one of the greatest rock songs of all time finds itself on one of the most boring rock albums of all time.  To add insult to injury, the notes on the CD cover proudly boast of 'a full eight months recording' time, which had been 'preceded by a year and a half of reflection and writing'.  We're talking 26 months here, surely time enough to produce a decent album.  Instead, they produced their only good song, which I'll say again, is an acknowledged classic, only hated by true Eagles fans, as most true fans hate the classics of their favourite bands.  If an unknown band had tried to get a record deal at that time on the basis of the rest of the filler, I seriously doubt they'd have been successful.  For good use of studio time see what can be done with just 30 HOURS of it on Led Zeppelin I+music
What happened Part 1+N+I was very dissapointed in this release, especially compared to their past efforts. Not a single song stood out on this, nothing different than the 76432714 other power metal carbon copy bands out there. If you're a fan of "Glory to the Brave", "Legacy of Kings" or even the "Renagade" album just end it there, this is not worth ruining the vision of a once good band.+music
Poseur+N+Kid "Rock" is to rock-and-roll what Twinkies are to gourmet cooking.  He's a poseur and a pretender, who tries to mimick the attitude and style of those who went before him -- Bob Seeger, Rolling Stones -- while hoping that no one will notice that he has none of their talent.  Why listen to a pale imitation when the music of the true greats is still available? +music
An Underrated talent.+P+Whitley combines dissonant electric guitar with acoustic and his songwriting style is uniquely his own. &quot;Automatic&quot; is the best thing here, but you can't go wrong on any of the others. I prefer this more  full-bodied work to his other stripped down acoustic affairs, &quot;Living  With the Law&quot; and &quot;Dirt Floor&quot;+music
sco's got the funk+P+we need the funk, and john scofield provides it. chill down and groove with it+music
disney karaoke+N+I am very upset - I bought all three and no onscreen lyrics - why would I buy a karaoke cd without them? I feel that I just wasted 41 dollars+music
Suga Free, problem free+P+This is a very solid debut. A unique style of flow that seperates him from the pack, but easy to bang. Hes hot. Production is Q-U-I-K no C so u know its bangin. Lyrically this cat is a west koast phenom and highly underrated. For the majority of the album the feel is reminiscent of Quiks ground breaking "Tonite". Very close to being a classic. My reviews are for those close to the streets so if this isnt u dont be surprised if u dont agree. 6X9 b down or get klowne+music
The new sony is very poor quality+N+I bought this never having problems from Amazon.com before.  They did not state that this was a Sony product and when I received it, all the CD had on it was a root kit virus.  It would not even play in my CD player.  When I tried to read the CD to copy and burn the "WAV" files to a new CD so I could just listen to the music, all there were on the CD was executables and no sound files.  Sony is very poor quality now and I do not want to buy it again+music
not his best+N+I am a Ry Cooder fan, and this is not his best. I was quite dismayed and it is one of the C.D's I never listen to. If you are looking for good Ry Cooder, this is not the one to buy+music
I couldn't bring myself to listen to the whole CD+N+I saw one of their music videos playing at Walmart and thought to myself: This is really cool!  Another goth/rock/alternative band along the lines of Evanescence.  I happen to be a big fan of Evanescence and I LIKE the mainstream twist of goth/rock/alternative.  Most of the times repetative music doesn't bother me.  You find this A LOT in pop, R&B and even country.  It's almost common to mistaken a Mariah Carey or Shania Twain song for a different one.  In fact, Mariah even made a remix that blended 2 of her songs.    To get back on track, I liked the female vocal.  The songs didn't allow her full potential of her talent.  The male vocals were ok.  I wasn't looking for a strictly GOTH or strictly METAL band but a mix of the two.  I happen to like it when artists experiment with music.  Otherwise Linkin Park wouldn't exist (love 'em too).  None of the songs really grabbed my attention.  Normally, there would be at least one or two I'd really listen to on a CD.  I didn't catch the name of the one that was in the music video @ Walmart so after I bought it I tried to pick it out.  I kept thinking to myself: this one must be it!  But when I get to the next one I think: wait, this one might be it!  Then they all sounded the same so I gave up.  I really tried to be open minded & and almost forced myself to pick out at least one song that would rectify purchasing a whole CD for.  But they were all pretty bland.  I don't think I've ever been so disappointed over an album purchase.  Due to the attempt at the mainstream rock/goth I gave it the extra star+music
maiden keeps on churning out the greatness+P+once again maiden brings it all and creates another masterpiece. aces high is no doubt one of the greatest opening tracks ever, followed by the live favorite 2 minutes to midnight another solid rocker. the middle of the cd is filled with solid songs, that are all pretty much straight forward rockers. then comes powerslave which has one of my favorite solo portions. then it ends with rhynme of the ancient mariner, the second best epic they have. this would be a good introductory album for people new to maiden.  UP THE IRONS!!+music
Never got to listen to it .+N+I never received the CD from Amazon despite seveeral e-mails to track down my order . I asked American Express to cancel my charges since there wasn't any response from Amazon +music
Repetitive and uncreative+N+Yup..those are two of the biggest problems with Day of fire. They have an overused hard rock/grunge sound to begin with, and all the songs on the album sound exactly the same. Cornerstone, Through the fire and Time stand out on their on, whereas the rest of the songs sound too formulated. Hopefully there next release will be a bit more creative+music
War and Peace+N+As a fan of Buth and his song contributions to the Flatlanders, I was disappointed to find many of the songs to be unsubtle, strident polemics against war  or the obstacles to peace.  The melodies were not memorable.  It is in sharp contrast to Neil Youngs most recent release dealing with the same topic. +music
Good Soundtrack+P+Good music from a truly funny film. Aretha at her finest. Belushi can sing! Great interprettions of Chicago style blues. A must have for your soundtrack or pop collection. Good party record too+music
Fury From 1999+P+There are often times where we see artists sampling great songs from others, and that has been considered a good or a bad move. Recently, the Red Hot Chili Peppers sampled Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers Mary Jane's Last Dance for their funky track, Dani California. Nevertheless, to spin a song of your own, and sample it into another song for an artists own self is considered even more ironic. That is the case for Prince, and his latest single, Fury, the third single from his album 3121. The song samples the opening hook from his 80's track 1999, and takes it into something else. The song actually is good, and delivers a unique feeling of funk, soul & pop. It is a really good track, that still shows that Prince hasn't lost his edge. I found this to be surprisingly upbeat and worth its price. This is a great song, and I hope it gets a lot of good airplay.  Song: +music
Wild Ox Moan?+N+I special ordered this album after reading a review in Jazziz praising the artist and his work.  One week later I couldn't wait to unwrap it and stuff it into my CD player ...........AWFUL, pure and simple.  As I continue to read flowery reviews I am bewildered.  Weak and reedy voice, poor recording, background instrumentals muffled and distracting. The title Wild Ox Moan about says it all. Honestly, I cannot make it through a single song or through the album at a single sitting+music
It's ladies night in Danger Danger land+N+Yep this is pretty much pop metal for twelve year old girls par excellence. This stuff may not require a lot of musical talent but it certainly requires plenty of stylists for hair - perhaps sitting around in stylists chairs does count as 'suffering for your art'.   But honest injun, I only review albums that I actually own and since I've never ever thrown away a single disc ever bought - well you guessed it - I paid for it and still own it.  The airheaded pop stuff here is truly grating. My list of major problems with this release is;  1 - A band called Danger Danger puts out an album with the lead track of Naughty Naughty. The saving grace is that Naughty Naughty is a darn fine song. Really, the genre doesn't get much better than this. Pity about the rest of this album. 2 - This is the kind of band that Metal Edge magazine pushed to the fore - one of the most horrid segments of the mag was entitled 'The Way the Were' which actually had photos of the band members as kids. Really, pandering to the musical tastes of 12 year old girls is not the way forward. Then again, at the time D/D made a bit of cash so perhaps they're the ones laughing now. 3 - "Bang Bang - what's that sound / I gave you my heart then you shot me down"    If Naughty Naughty was the genre at it's best then tunes like Bang Bang were the genre at it's most dire.  I have nothing but good memories of this band - they certainly gave us all a good laugh at the time. Despite the fact that in so many ways this only deserves one star, I can't possibly do it. These guys bent over backwards to make themselves seem so nice you wouldn't want to hurt their feelings. Not to mention the fact that Saturday Nite also rocks well. Two great songs and a couple of other good hooks just don't rate so it can't get more than two stars+music
Pop (rock/hip-hop) songs for your girlfriend (boyfriend & U)+P+Bottom line: a very enjoyable album for ANYONE with an open mind.  Girlfriends, boyfriends, single people, married people, old, young, male, female.  You probably already know (and like) at least 3 songs from this album: "Every Morning", "Someday", "Falls Apart".  So, you're already off to a great start.  And, for those of you old-school Sugar Ray ROCK fans, there's plenty here for you.  Try "Personal Space Invader", "Aim For Me", "Glory", and "Burning Dog" if you enjoy cranking it to 11.  Actually, this album is predominantly rock inspired...if you've  listened to the WHOLE THING.  Hip hop fans will find "Live and Direct" featuring KRS-One to be a pleasant little surprise.  80's fans will take to their spiced up rendition of Steve  Miller's "Abracadabra".  And, they've got some nice softer tunes in the form of "Ode to the Lonely Hearted" and "Even Though" (a song which seems to have jumped off the time machine from the 50's or something...good stuff).  And, of course there a bits and pieces of that trademark Sugar Ray humor thrown about the album.  Like they always say, Sugar Ray is all about having fun.  Period.  If things like "image" matter to you, then steer clear of this band.  If dogmatic adherence to one specific style of music (and ONLY one specific  style of music) excites you then steer clear of this band.  But, if you like having fun with your music (a.k.a. ENJOYING it) and if you can appreciate diverse musical influences, then here ya' go+music
Very good CD, I recommend it to any serious Pop music collector!+P+This CD has a "catch": the surprisingly beautiful voice of Leigh Nash.   I am usually reluctant to hits covers, but in this case I would suggest to give a special try to SNTR performance of The La's "There She Goes", Crowded House's superhit "Don't Dream It's Over", and even Abba's "Dancing Queen". Special mention to that wonderful tune titled "Kiss Me". Leigh Nash's voice reinvents these songs and provides a new dimension to the meaning of "Cover version".   Believe me... this CD is a serious improvement for your music collection!+music
THIS, is music+P+I recently put my vinyl onto a CD, and had a chance to revisit this be-UUU-tiful work.  I agree with another reviewer that "Sweetheart" alone is worth the price of admission.  If you like a combination of jazz, blues, pop ... heck, no labels necessary.  In the words of her own song (from another album: "Label it garbage/Label it art/You can't call it soul/You'll have to call it heart".  So if you love serious good music, get this album+music
It grows on you.+P+I bought this album two years ago, because I'd fallen in love with the one song that made it to radio &quot;In My Hands,&quot; and was hoping the whole album was built like that song.  How wrong I was. At the time I hated it.  I put it away and didn't listen to it again until about a month ago.  While I still think that &quot;Space Ceildh&quot; could stand to go away, I must admit the album grows on you. &quot;Get Me Through December&quot; is a haunting song, as is &quot;Flora MacDonald.&quot;  I like it more and more+music
Bad CD copy+N+I played this CD and was not happy.  I had to return the item becasue it skipped really bad on almost every song+music
Def Leppard's finest hour.+P+Predating the whole pop-metal explosion of the later 80's by a few years, Def Leppard's 1983 masterpiece "Pyromania" still is a shining of how metal sensibilities can successfully merge with pop to create something that has integrity, substance and not an inkling of self parody (which Def Leppard would end up falling prety to themselves in a few short years after this album).  I became a Def Leppard fan with their 1981 album High 'n' Dry but Pyromania took things to an entirely different level.  The songwriting in particular stands as some of the best and catchiest of the 80's (or any decade for that matter).  The band never sounded better and this was the last album for a while that drummer Rick Allen would play an acoustic kit on as he hadn't had his tragic 1984 car wreck yet in which he would lose his left arm.  Singer Joe Elliot's voice was its strongest as well displaying a great range throughoug the wide range of songs on this album.  Guitarist Steve Clark along with Pete Willis (who would be sacked shortly before this album was completed) create a great guitar team.  Peter Collen only contributed some solos to this album as he joined really late in the game, but his solo on the track Stagefright (my favorite DL tune of all time BTW) is amazing in both his note choice & chops in addition to his feel.   Bassist Rick Savage and drummer Rick Allen create a rock solid rhythm section in the vein of AC/DC and add to the proceedings without drawing too much attention to themselves.  Producer Robert "Mutt" Lange would contribue to a co-writer on most tracks in addition to adding a very clean and crips sheen to all of the tracks.  This is one of the most well mixed rock/metal albums ever.  To be honest, there's not much more I can say about how great this album is that other countless reviewers have already stated.  This is Def Leppard at the height of their powers/creativity and unfortunately beginning slightly with Hysteria, the world would see the band crumble into self parody and an endless sea of wretched power ballads.  Essential! +music
Not Even In This World+N+These days, it seems like you hve to try to be a reality star inorder to make it big. For a celebutant like Paris Hilton, she doesn't really deliver as a solid an soulful singer. That is very unfortunately  big shame. Her second single, Nothing In This World, isn't a very good song from a wannabe pop star. The song like Stars Are Blind, is just as bad. I am not very convinced at all. She sounds like she is trying to had to really deliver like Britney Spears, Jennifer Lopez and Kelly Clarkson. To actually be honest with you, I'd rather listen to Michael Jackson instead of this. Paris is not aything in this world, and this song is just the shameful same.  Song: F   +music
NOT THAT GREAT+N+I disagree with all others who reviewed this album. This album is somewhat decent for its time ('94) but overall, the beats are garbage. I think Eiht really stepped up his game when he came out with Death Threatz. The beats on that album are great and I give that album 5 stars+music
Blast from the past+P+I can vividly remember when this type of music was "new"  now it's just very collectable.  Of the steamroller set I loved number 1 and this one.  Help us and save us I had the record albums.  Granted, the cover pctures were more enjoyable back then.  Aside from sentiment it is still lively music. Buy one now+music
These guys rock!+P+I first heard this band in the movie 'Desperado'.  I have a couple of their CD's and really enjoy the grooves while driving.  If you're a big top 40 fan, (Britney Spears, etc.) You may not like it.  The songs are not cranked out of the radio play tune machine and have bizzare subject matter.  Keep it up Tito!  P.S. I have tried with poor success to get my friends into this band, but I stand by my taste+music
awesome+P+i love this cd cassie steele is a great singer and actress i hope see comes out with another album hope y'all love it as much as i d+music
A solid album+P+Being a newer fan to Anti-Flag and only catching their albums (The Terror State and For Blood and Empire) I will admit my ignorance along the lines of their earlier work with what little I know of it.  Something that I have noticed with a large majority of the negative reviews about this album is how they view the political aspects of the album and of the band, as well.  Is this not a cd?  Does the cd not have MUSIC.  How about having a critic on just the music itself like how many of the songs have strong messages and I've been hearing some impressive bass parts along with very catchy songs.  I don't know who Crass is and I don't care.  It's all a matter of opinion and if you don't like the album, that's your deal.  I think it's pretty solid.  Though, I will say this.  Something that I have never liked about Anti-Flag is their music is so limited.  You can only write so many songs about the same topic before it gets old.  Something that I have always appreciated with bands is versatility with writing songs.  So far from what I've heard, it's just all politics... though that is the path that Anti-Flag has chosen to take and they have stuck with it ever since.  So kudos to them+music
Brainwashing the Masses+N+It never ceases to amaze me how punk bands today consistantly preach against brainwashing when they do exactly what they condemn.  Anti-Flag is nothing more than a gimmick band who got popular riding the "Down with the establishment" bandwagon with little real political commentary or discourse.  That being said, I fully believe that bands (and anyone) should have the right to say and think what they want.  After all, this is America, and I am serving in the Army right now to ensure that we have this right.  It just gets to me how they are so willing to step on the very thing which symbolizes that right: The American Flag.  This album is proof yet again that this is what they intend to do.  I have no respect for this traitorus band and would never give them a penny of my hard-earned money.  Besides, wouldn't a real communist refuse to capitalize on their music, anyway+music
Something ain't right+N+Definitely not as good as "Down in Albion".  THAT record is magic.  This ep is...I dunno...nothing special.  It's missing something.  Mick Jones?  Junk?  Not sure.  I had high expectations from Pete, and this was a bit of a let down+music
good rex+P+marc bolan is my main man man.  he's just like a lil consuela+music
Live fast, die young, stay pretty.......+P+Like so many of the albums I now find myself trawling for, my first copy of The Slider was on good old 12" vinyl. In that original incarnation it only included the first 13 tracks now included on the CD release. "Thunderwing" and "Lady" were, if memory serves me, first aired on the B-side of the "Metal Guru" single, while "Cadillac" (the great single-that-never-was in my opinion) never really seemd to find a home it was happy with. In feel it probably belongs with the sparser-sounding "Zip Gun" than with the lusher "Slider" or "Tanx" production. Purists may argue that "Electric Warrior" is the T.Rex album to own if you're only going to have the one, but it is essentially a transitional album bridging the gap between the earlier Tolkienesque folk period and the Glam that followed and ends up being neither one thing nor t'other. "Slider" lies firmly in the latter period and is as good an example of the strengths and weaknesses of Marc Bolan as writer and performer as you are likely to get. I can think of nobody else in the modern period who has been able to extract such a variety of results from the basic three-chord blues riff. It's a well documented fact that Bolan would have loved to be Elvis, and on the strength of this perhaps he wouldn't have made a bad job of it. It's too easy to treat some of the lyrics harshly, branding them "pretentious" or "unintelligeable", (although if it were early 20th century poetry it would be called "hermetic" and treated with reverence), but that's what Bolan was all about from first to last. T.Rex are probably pretty much of an unknown quantity to most American listeners outside of "Get It on" (with it's title inexplicably censored for transatlantic consumption). Here in Britain for 3 or so all too brief years he was the epitome of a pop star. "Slider" more than any other album illustrates what he was about before succumbing to McCartney's Syndrome and putting the wife on keyboards+music
Teenage Memories+P+My friend Marc and I used to take trips to the old coastal bunkers all around the San Francisco Bay Area to map them out.  The first thing we would do when hopping into the car was stick The Slider in the 8 track.  Now admittedly, the lyrics were nonsensical and silly, but the sound was so catchy, that in no time we'd be singing along with them.  The sound was just so unique and riveting, that we'd listen over and over.  Point is, this album will give bring back memories if you grew up in that era, and will give you an idea of what it was really like growing up in the 70's+music
Absolutely righteous!!!+P+Great musicianship and well throughtout lirycs. It's brilliant, original, melodic, fast and vicious. Weel done melodies, incredible solos. Can't go wrong with this one!+music
Two great rarities and lot of crappy remixes+N+This review has to start with a couple of admissions.  First, I happen to think Cyndi Lauper (especially in her later albums) is an underrated songwriter and performer.  Most people think of her as a pop-culture icon of the 80's and unfortunately dismiss what she's done since then.  Some of her later ballads are sung with great emotion and are among the best-written songs I've ever heard.  On the other hand, I really HATE remixes, especially when they're done solely to try to make "danceable" a song that was never intended to be dance music.  So I approached this album with a mix of excitement and fear... excitement that the "rarities" would be more of Cyndi's great songwriting and fear that the remixes would suck, as remixes tend to do.  The two rarities on the album are the songs "The World is Stone" and "You Have to Learn to Live Alone".  There are also extended versions of "Mother" and "What's Going On".  "The World is Stone" talks about how people are turning to stone, "cold to the touch and hard on the soul".  The instrumentals are acceptable but nothing special.  Cyndi's vocals convey the emotional message she's sending exceptionally well, and it's a well-written message about there being "no warmth anymore" and "no love anymore".  While it may be a "rarity" it is definitely one of her better and more powerful songs.  "You Have to Learn to Live Alone" has a kind of blues or jazz sound to it.  You could imagine it being sung in a smoky nightclub in Casablanca.  Cyndi pulls off the kind of vocals you expect with the music, delivering a powerful and emotional performance in the context of what's a fairly subdued, soft song.  The instrumentals on this song are much better than those for "The World is Stone".  The rest of the album consists of remixes, and as I said above, I generally hate remixes.  These are really no exception.  If I had to describe the remixes on this album in a single sentence, that sentence would be: "How to turn some decent Cyndi Lauper music into something unrecognizable and crappy."  If you're into the techno-sounding disco stuff, you might enjoy these, I don't know.  Personally, they ruin some decent songs to me.  The only good thing I can find to say about them is that at least they didn't mess with some of her better songs and stuck with the more mainstream stuff like "Hey Now (Girls Just Wanna Have Fun)"...    If the entire album was like "The World is Stone" and "You Have to Learn to Live Alone" I would probably give it something in the 8-10 (out of 10) range.  Those two songs are quite good and easily among her best work.  But the 6 remixes on the album pretty much ruin it for me, and I can't in good conscience give the entire album anything better than about a 4.  If it was an album of just the remixes, it would get maybe a 2, and would only rank that high because Cyndi's voice appears in them+music
NICE HAPPY MUSIC+P+This music is totally light-hearted and hugely enjoyable. Track 3 is so cool and track 9 is kind of spooky. I only wish more tracks from the film were in it+music
I'm disappointed+N+Maybe I expect too much from an old Wurlitzer but I don't remember the snare drums being so distorted in real life as they are on this CD. Almost like there was some kind of a frequency clipper on the microphone(s) or maybe they were in the wrong place and were overloaded. Whatever the reason I think this CD needs to be remastered (or something) to fix this problem before it can be truly enjoyable. I note also a similar comment about the Volume II CD+music
Scarface and Ludacris Is the King Of The South!!+P+i agree scarface is very underrated and he should get more credit than he usually gets but yo, he is rich as hell. his albums may not sell as much or get much publicity but he is CEO of Def Jam South and he is the one who signed Ludacris to Def Jam, so its without a doubt Scarface definetely knows how to find talent and make mone+music
very unhappy+N+i am very disapointed with my purchase  4 of the songs on my wison pickett c d were damaged the disc looked new but the recordings of these songs were ruined they did not pla+music
Weak Orchestral Arrangements + Not Ottmar's Best+N+I am a fan of Ottmar's work so I did not hesitate when I found a copy of this album for sale. Though not a terrible record it is not what your average Ottmar fan has come to expect. The orchestral arrangements are clumsy or forgettable at best - inappropriate and dischordant at worst. Ottmar's guitar work is mostly relegated to plinking along - sometimes in a slightly dissonant fashion - on top of the orchestral arrangements. None of it is horrible, and a few cuts are even interesting, but my guess is that the typical Ottmat Leibert fan won't be listening to this CD more than once or twice. There are FAR better choices for anyone who likes Ottmar's work. Stick with his more popular stuff and save having to trade this in for somethign else (as I will be doing)+music
Songs that will put Adventure in Your Heart+P+My gal Sara and I lived on a sailboat in the Caribbean for a long time and we spent most of it at anchor, as we hated marinas. Besides, they were expensive. We're both writers, so on a good day, flat seas, anchored off a deserted island like the Five Island group in Trinidad or Ile Fourche, halfway between St. Martin and St. Barts, where it is pitch black on a cloudy night, but oh so gorgeous when the sky is clear, we'd put these four CDs along with Banana Wind in the CD player's magazine, put the machine on random play, then read and write the day away with Jimmy B playing in the background.  There is just something about listening to Mr. Buffett in the Caribbean, Florida too, that seems so right. His catchy, lyrical, sailing stories, drinking stories, personal stories never get old. They're as fresh the hundredth time as they were the first time. This collection is simply outstanding in every way, not a turkey in the bunch, and oh yes, Mr. B has sung a few turkeys in his day, but as I said, they are not here. These songs will move you to laughter, maybe a tear or two and they may have you up and dancing a bit, but most of all they well waken a sense of adventure in you. Well, they should anyway, unless you're a died in the wool, TV watching, couch potato. But, you know, chances are that even if you do tube the day away, these songs just might get your heart pounding and your soul wanting a bit of adventure. That's a good thing.

Great Movie!+P+This is the best animated cartoon film I have ever seen! The story plot is clearly and well developed. The character and its animation is drawn in great detail. The supporting soundtracks were also great. :-) This movie is not only for kids, the adults will love this film too+music
Good Old Country Gospel+N+I was very disappointed in CD.  Way to hillbilly for me+music
Her singing is gorgeous, but . . .+N+Maire Brennan's singing and artistry is breathtakingly beautiful, and for most this can be rated a fabulous album.  You need to understand, however, that this is a decidedly, in your face, unavoidably christian album.  For those, like me, who are recovering from christianity, it was an unpleasant surprise, but not one for which I will fault or judge Maire Brennan.  I just wish I had realized it before I had bought the album.  It would be better listed or sold under christian music than under any other category+music
A Wonderful collection of haunting songs.+P+''Under A Violet Moon'' is a great CD for any Blackmore's Night fan. Lady Candice's voice is eerily haunting, yet comforting as well. Ritchie's miraculous guitar playing is perfectly blended with his wife's voice. A beautiful Masterpiece+music
early joe+P+4 tunes,3 live,one studio,all excellent songs,if you don't have surfing with the alien get that cd+music
NOT AS GOOD AS RALPH'S WORLD+N+Roberts songwriting falls flat . We didn't find the songs as appropriate for children as many other children artists. Roberts songs are very bleak and not children friendly.  Stick with Wiggles or Ralph's World+music
I am WIERD+P+OK....see if you can make sense of this...my favorite bands are Radiohead, the Cure, Bauhaus, Talking Heads, Kraftwerk, and Dan Fogelberg.....so, where does his sound fit into this genre' of music?  IT DOESNT...i just happen to love this guys voice and his tunes....my favorite one on here is Same Ol Lang Syne...oh my god, i melt when i hear this....i have to admit, lots of his music is sentimental to me due to my childhood, but i  listen to him pretty much every night when i go to bed..i think his music is beautiful......Peace :+music
Alicia Jiles Right is a Smart A** Moron+P+I'm so sick of this "Alicia Jiles Right" moron. I can't figure this clown out, she gave Eminem's music 5 stars and said its really good and Eminem is just as if not more offensive to women as Snoop Dogg. You obviously think we're all dumb don't you? Snoop Dogg disrespects woman etc do you think we don't know that? I don't know you but I bet your are pure idiot. Lay off Snoop Dogg and any other rappers your trashing neg reviews on. Keep your f***** opinions to yourself Biotch!  Anyway I miss the old Snoop Doggy Dogg. It seems this guy can't top his debut however if you are a fan of Snoop like me you should purchase this album along with all the others  Doggystyle, Tha Doggfather, Da Game Is To Be Sold Not To Be Told, No Limit Top Dogg, Tha Last Meal, Dead Man Walkin, Tha Eastsidaz, Duces N Trayz THe Old Fashioned Way, R & G The Masterpiece, Welcome to tha chuuch Da album and probably some more I have not mentioned. Like I said it's not as good as some of the others but if you are a true Snoop fan click add to cart now.  +music
Dreadful Senesino+N+First of all,Decca engineers insist on to differentiate "their" Scholl's voice from that more sweet,resounding previous Harmonia Mundi cd's like Bach Cantatas Solo,English Folksongs and so on where it was a pleasure to hear this singer.Even orchestra Bizantina could be better recorded;maybe Milano Auditorium hasn't fine acoustics.However,the same happens on "Heroes" and "Banquett".In this Senesino combo just here,Scholl's voice sounds rough and unpleasant,the top of his range excessive and satured.Second of all,in my opinion,opera isn't his confort zone for good.I believe that as a chorister boy,he grew up in that german musical territory singing sacred music by Buxtehude,Bach,where he did his best on recording.In this cd,I heard his worse;a rugged vocalization plentiful in ha-ha-ha,absolutely abusive that seems dreadful to me("Al lampo dell'armi" for instance),his vocal colours sounding like croacks sometimes,incongruous and dramatically unfruitful attempt to perform repertoire previously recorded by himself like it was a new,fresh one("Dove sei","Aure,deh,...").I'm sorry;I know Scholl fans are very zealous on their idol but I have heard much better Senesinos by Derek Lee Ragin,Daniels,Minter,Gall and so on.+music
Flyleaf is so awesome!!!+P+I bought their EP CD yesterday, I was going to buy their full album but I didn't have enough money and then I saw the EP CD was cheaper, so I just had to buy it. I liked FlyLeaf before I had their CD because I knew the songs "I'm so sick" and "Fullyalive" I've seen, the Fully Alive video on Sky Angel (A Christian Channel) before, and the video is awesome! I love all the songs on this cd, my favorite is of course "Fully Alive" and "Red Sam", and "I'm so sick", I love all of the songs though, I can't wait to buy their full CD next time, knowing me I will always love listening to their cd! I LOVE this band, they are better than Evanescence! I HIGHLY recommend that you buy this CD, and the debut CD! I can't wait til their next CD comes out! And Lacey Mosley, does really good in her singing and she can yell in the songs too, she's awesome! FLY LEAF ROCKS+music
A hallmark album for a superb band to showcase its contemporary bluegrass+P+Playing Time - 39:05 -- Don Rigsby doesn't even turn the big 4-0 until February 28 of 2008. Already he has two decades of professional bluegrass experience with such top groups as Longview, Bluegrass Cardinals, J.D. Crowe & the New South, Lonesome River Band and Rock Country. He's also released four highly-acclaimed solo albums and was twice named SPBGMA's male vocalist for the year. When Rock Country disbanded, Don was faced with two choices - work for someone else, or form his own band. He chose the latter and, unlike previous solo albums from Rigsby (on the Sugar Hill label) that enlisted friends and session players, he has recorded "Hillbilly Heartache" with his own group (Midnight Call) that includes himself singing lead and playing mandolin, along with Dale Vanderpool (banjo), Shayne Bartley (guitar), Jesse Wells (fiddle), and Robert Maynard (bass). It was a good move to do it all themselves this time because it's a crackerjack band.   In a few instances, (Make God Laugh, Red Bird, Prisoner on the Highway), their vocal arrangements also call for Rigsby to jump up to tenor on the choruses. "He Loves To Hear You Shout" (written by Dixie and Tom T. Hall) is a very nicely presented vocal quartet for the group with Rigsby, Vanderpool, Bartley and Wells doing the vocalizing.   While best known for his mandolin picking, Don's a versatile multi-instrumentalist, and it's a treat to hear him also provide some snippets of guitar, mandele, and fiddle. Two songs ("These Golden Fields" and "Any Bar in Birmingham") incorporate some of Don's light percussion. The former, about farming, features Don's high-lead singing with two harmonies below, as well as Wells' octave violin for a different mood. Obviously, quite a bit of forethought went into producing these songs in the best possible manner for us. In a few, the banjo is muted, and on the closing number, "I Am The Man, Thomas") Jesse Wells lays down his fiddle to provide clawhammer banjo as the only accompaniment for Don's voice.   Midnight Call's repertoire is drawn from some excellent songwriters (Shawn Camp, Marty Rabon, Jim Lauderdale, Mark Brinkman, Larry Shell, Kim Williams, Tim Stafford, and others). Bobby Cyrus is a co-writer of "Big Jim." I'm curious as to whether Big Jim is a fictional folkloric character or whether there was actually a man who sacrificed himself for others. You may recall that it was Cyrus who penned the reflective "Carved Our Names in Stone" that was sung solo by Rigsby on his last solo album, The Midnight Call. Farmers, family, life and love get ample coverage in the songs. For his song of home, he belts out an inspired rendition of Bill Monroe's "Kentucky Waltz." Another tale from that region is an intoxicating "Daddy Was A Moonshine Man." A standard instrumental, "Forked Deer" gallops along, but I hope their future projects introduce us to new tunes. Sung solo, "Old Green Chevrolet" relates a tale of a traveling preacher bringing the gospel to mountain folks, and I missed a little harmony on the choruses.   With "Hillbilly Heartache," evocative messages get us thinking, smiling, contemplating, and even laughing when the intoxicating "Daddy Was A Moonshine Man" cues up. This Kentuckian clearly has strong mountain roots, and he knows what it takes to produce a very compelling bluegrass album. His reputation and dedication to traditional music, and his innovative vision for the future, are well documented. While he may have stretched boundaries a bit in the past, "Hillbilly Heartache" is simply a hallmark album for a superb band to showcase its contemporary bluegrass. (Joe Ross, staff writer, Bluegrass Now) +music
excellent album+P+When Layne died he didn't get enough respect. He stopped making music for a long time. If he died in 1996 is death would have been more meaningful like Kurt Cobains. Makes you think? Anyway this album is excellent and the last song is called over now. Get it+music
Waist of time...+N+When I first heard the song inside it got stuck in my head for a long time, and everytime i heard it after that it would get stuck in my head even longer... so i decided to go buy the album.. which was one big mistake.. the vocals are horrid and theres not one good song to get into.. It doesnt even deserve 1 star but i give them one for some how making it to tv..So dont waist your time or money on this band, go for bands like From Zero, Pillar, or Thousand Foot Krutch+music
Brilliant debut album!!!!!!+P+Thanks for reading. I'm surprised reading some reviews that this album receives such poor comments from people. This stuff is brilliant and has awesome songs! As usual the album is a great mix of slower and faster songs. The early line-up was great, albiet missing Don Felder. ( forget about Walsh ) What's remarkable for me is not the hit songs " Take it Easy" "Witchy women" and " Peaceful Easy Feeling " ( which are all wonderful songs ) it's the OTHER songs. Some are just brilliant, including " Chug all night" "Tryin" and the best non single ever from the Eagles " Take the Devil" Mind blowing song from Randy Miesner. Great guitar and melodies as usual. This is my second favourite Eagles album, just pipped by " One of these nights"  A must for music fans in general. This is GREAT MUSIC!!!  Essential for your collectio+music
AWESOME+P+Loretta Lynn rocks.  Awesome cd.  "Portland Oregon" is one of the best songs I have heard in a long, long, time.  No one says "Oregon" like Loretta.  Rock on, Loretta+music
Bob's worst+N+I'm a huge Dylan fan---own everything he ever released.  In my humble opinion, this is Bob's worst.  Just a really bad CD.  'Nuff said+music
Two thumbs up+P+I never listened to Celine Dion's music much. I happened to check this album out from the library and had to go out and buy it after it was returned. This album has just the right mix of sad, slow love songs and up-beat ones. I would buy all of her CD's simply based on this one+music
Timeless+P+The soundtrack of this movie was undoubtedly instrumental in making Empire of the Sun the amazingly beautiful movie that it is.  With the first track alone, SUO GAN, which is actually a Welsh lullaby and not a Japanese song, you'll find yourself riveted and drawn to the time and place and story of Jim. The beauty of listening to this soundtrack is sitting back, and reliving the scenes from the movie in your head.  It is timeless, bittersweet and triumphant all in one+music
Heavy Metal Chuck Berry.+P+Was reborn when I heard this. I used to be a heavy metal rocker in my teens, but hearing it now is a whole 'nuther experience. You cant fault the raw energy of this band, they smoke! It's balls out, no nonsense, bread n butter rock music, no gimmicks. Check out the Movie (Let there Be Rock) and see the experience! Angus's striptease is hysterical and consolidates his place as one of Rock's true characters. He is essentially Chuck berry on Speed! Bon was a true gravelly dude. My mum used to work at a Salon called Scissors in the 70's and her college 'Silver' used to date Bon, so she got to meet the boys a few times. When she cut Angus's hair, he apparently said nothing and drank 4 pints of milk during the process. A real school boy to the end. I love this band and I love Bon's smutty lyricism, too. R.I.P+music
Perfect Pop Album? Not even close+N+Well, it has been more than two years now, and Perfect Pop Album is (somehow) back after it's very minor success with the first edition, and it seems that this new edition is going to do even worse.  First problem, Hollywood Records shouldn't be doing complications. They are Disney Records's sister. I mean, look at the tracklistings. They look like another Radio Disney Jams CD. Joss Stone, Josh Kelly, and Liz Phair are really the only reason buying "Got Hits 2". The rest are Disney Channel fillers.  The CD starts with seven Disney acts in a row, starting with Hilary Duff, the lastest flop in the music industry. Depsite the fact she had multi-platinum success with "Metamorphisis", she didn't even go Gold on her self-titled second album. "Come Clean" was really the only big hit by this artist, which to me was a big shocker, "So Yesterday" was way better. Then we move to Jesse McCartney, OH BOY! "Beautiful Soul" may have a good melody, but Jesse's vocals, awful. And the lyrics make no sense. "I don't want another pretty face, I don't want just anyone to hold, I don't want my love to go to waste, I want you and your beautiful soul." Well, if you think about it, isn't that a beautiful soul? A girl with a pretty face, and good personality? Whatever. Let's move on to JoJo. Okay, I don't mind her, as long as you put something decent by her, like "Leave (Get Out)". Instead, they put her hit "Baby It's You". The song did well on the charts, and the song is decent, but I think I've had enough. But wait, there's four more! Lindsay Lohan is next up, she didn't have many hit songs, unless you coun't her minor "Rumors" big. They put on "Ultimate". WTF? When and where was that a hit? Or maybe I should look on foriegn charts to see why Hollywood Records chose this. It was on the 2003 soundtrack "Freaky Friday", and all of the sudden it's big. Moving on. Next up is Bow Wow's rival, Romeo. Okay, for all honesty here, how DID he get a record deal? Master P's song "Make Em Say Ugh" wasn't bad enough? "My Cinderella" is just a poor quality rap song you'd hear on Radio Disney. Then we have Skye Sweetnam. Now, "Tangled Up In Me" is actually a decent song. It's melody is damn catchy, and they have pretty good voices. I definitely wouldn't recommended their "Noise From The Basement" album. Way too much filler. Then we have unknown Jump 5. Okay, don't name the album Got Hits if you have an unknown artist. Anyway, "God Bless The U.S.A." is horrible, they can't sng their way out of a bag. Then we're FINALLY up with Disney artists (but their revenge comes again later in the CD).  Next, we have a country song by Rascal Flatts. It's okay; not a country fan. The album is called "Got Hits 2: More Perfect POP". Notice the uppercase letters. Then, we have our first song worth listening to, from Joss Stone. Though, "Some Kind Of Wonderful" was barely a hit, it's still an awesome add, as the song is decent. She has a great voice and her songs are great; jazz flavored pop songs.   Then we have Raven-Symone and the Cheetah Girls. I'm not even continuing with this song, since those artists alone should spell trouble.  Luckily, after that, we have alternative rock queen Liz Phair, with her self lyriced "Extraordinary". The song is excellent, from the jammin' guitars to the extraordinary lyrics, to her voice. You should definitely check out her music, especially her older stuff.  Two paragraphs back, I said that Disney's revenge is coming. Well, the Disney Radio artists have returned. We have Raven Symone (second time on this CD) doing "Supernatural", which was probably the biggest hit in Disney Radio history, and is featured on "The Haunted Mansion" soundtrack. On regular Top 40 radio, never heard it. The song is average at best, and the same rule applies. Just because you have a big TV show, does not mean your vocals are automatically good and you can make a record. And the same rule applies with the next artist. Once again, the second song on this CD by Hilary Duff, and she brings her sister into the song, which is the third Disney Soundtrack song. This one was featured on the "A Cinderella Story" soundtrack. Okay, this remake is just horrific. First, you have the second worst vocals in the history of music (Milli Vanilli being the worst), then you have "Our Lips Are Sealed". Now, the Go-Gos version is very good, but the lyrics don't even fit Hilary. Next, we have the Vengaboys. Enough said. Then we have some group called Mr. C and the Slide Man. Maybe I'm not quite old enough, but who the F is this? The song is ridiculous, and definitely should not end up on a 2004-2005 hits album. Then, Josh Kelley's "Amazing" is amazing, and he actually writes his music. That gave me some hope about the end of this album...but wait...we're at the end.                 Unless you're a gigantic fan of Radio Disney and like 2003 songs on a 2005 complication, avoid this on all costs, and get Now 19 in stores Tuesday July 19, 2005.  Replay Value: Low Child Appeal: High Teen Appeal: Low Adult Appeal: Lo+music
When even a metalhead can appreciate ...+P+I typically don't listen to C&W; I'm more of a fan of the groups 'Disturbed', 'Staind', 'Metallica', etc., but I have to say that this is some of the best country and western I've heard to date.  After listening to the title track 'When It All Goes South', I went out and bought the CD.  It's laid back, upbeat, and thoroughly enjoyable to listen to+music
Very good sometimes, too electronic at others.+N+I was, overall, disappointed by this CD.  There are many good reviews here, but they generally overpraise.  Tracks 4 through 8 have too much synthesizer for my ears.  A major highlight is track 9, The Crab and the Egret, but interestingly, the flute is accompaniment to the wondrous Chinese percussion.  Disappointingly, the CD is only 40 minutes long and left me wanting more tunes without synthesizer accompaniment+music
Spare me the down talk.+P+This is an awesome band, and they've realeased an awesome CD. So it's not the most technical stuff. It has atmospehere. But ok, let's bash a band because their music has higher meaning than just cool sounds and constant head bangning. While there are some headbanging tracks on here, a lot of it is about the atmosphere. Somehow this music can sound very depressing but with in the same song gives you a sense of hope. It's a very different sound. Probably an aquired sound+music
Great jazz rock classic remastered with a bonus track to boot!!! I give "Fifth" it a high five"!!!+P+Soft Machines's "Fifth" (also known as "5") finally get the 24-bit remastering(from original tapes)that it deserves!!! Awesome full-detailed sound!!! Great booklet with photos and liner notes too!!! A jazz rock classic!!! Great playing from Hugh Hopper,Mike Ratledge,the late Elton Dean,Phil Howard,John Marshall,and Roy Babington!!! There's even a rare alternate take of "All White" included as a bonus track!!! Two thumbs up!!! Five stars!!! A+music
Slammin' Cuts Str8 Outta Texas +P+Pimp C and Bun B came out in 1994 with an album with nothin but fire.  This album slams from start to finish with that old school down south feel.  The beats are melodic G-Funk, with twangy guitar and smokin keyborad riffs.  Lyrically and vocally, UGK kills in all departments.  They really know how to tear up the mic with their firey flows. The track "Feds in Town" is a gangster classic with a phat, funky beat and tight scratches. "Super Tight..." is the perfect one to pop in the six fo while hittin switches down the avenue. The mid 90's was one of the best periods in rap history, and this album is testament to it.  Don't sleep on this classic+music
Real to his Homies+P+Scarface has definately captured the love of the street in this here album.  He straight up kept it real with all the homeboys in todays' rap biz.  With tracks like "Do what the .... you want to do" All the Homies in the street like me be flockin' to the record store for the fact that be the motto.  There is a lot of bad mouthin' goin' on in these reviews, but them folks need to check nuts and realize what has been done here.  Scarface dedicates this to Homies in the street, that's real. So much respect goes to the Big Homie Scarface for givin' it up to the street+music
Love Mariah Carey's Debut!+P+This is an inspirational CD as well as an indicator of Mariah's great talent.  I enjoy hearing her voice proceed up and down the scale and I love the Gospel flavor on some of her songs+music
A pleasure to listen to...+P+Belinda Carlisle is such a smooth and pleasant singer.  It is so nice to listen to hear.  This is a nice set of great hits+music
should be black and blue for owning this+N+it sucks and the album cover is pretty boring to+music
wow+N+The lead singer's song delivery is quite mopey. The keyboard solos are rather pedestrian, but was way ahead of it's time, it's match for match with "free jazz" and japanese noise. The guitarist is quite talented and to be honest, the rest of the band weighs down his true potential. The song "Riders in the Storm" is a good Exhibit A on why a band should not record whilst taking barbituates+music
cheese fest +N+bwahaaaaaahaaaaahahahahahahahahahahahha NO SERIOUSLY im not finished HOLDING MY SIDES YET BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA  oh man to actually think their are kids out there who consider this music.  I know im going to quit my job and paint my face with clown make up and change my name to weakho The @$$ clown (hey it wouldnt be any more ridiculous than any of these other lame retards names. colton grundy???)  and I should have millions by the end of the year from all the fuggaloes who are obviously smokin punds of weed out of a pipe to be diggin this junk. Canibus or asheru could rip these weak retards inside of one verse minus 500,000,000,000,000  stars. peace to all the real Hip hoppers out ther+music
Orpheus sings+P+This CD is true poetry, full of metaphor and metonymy. I have never become tired of listening to this poetry, the evocative moods and desolate yet soulful landscapes of loneliness. The pieces are timeless quality, and its musicality provides a backdrop for the lyrics rather than being intrusive. Truly a remarkable work of art+music
A Demanding Listen, but a Great  One+P+It ain't easy being an interpreter.  Christopher O'Riley's an accomplished classical pianist, but his biggest claims to fame are three piano interpretations of modern musicians--two discs worth or re-imagined Radiohead, and now this excellent exploration of Elliott Smith.   Most respectable classical musicians don't do this sort of thing--they usually stick to what are deemed respectable composers. And the ones who do bother with anything composed after, say, 1925 and played on anything other than orchestra instruments? They become a little trashy by association, exuding a faint odor of music whoredom as they ride the rock n' roll gravy train from the New Release section to the Bargain Bin. (This happens whether they're re-interpreting the Rolling Stones or Pink Floyd or, heaven help us, Metallica.) Heck, most musicians in general are fearful of doing too much of someone else's work, lest they be seen as bar-band ready tribute acts rather than as the sainted singer-songwriters they'd like to be.   Thank heavens O'Riley's not like most musicians. He seems to see interpretation as something like what it used to be in the Frank Sinatra heydey--something anyone can and should do as much as they want to, provided they're patient enough to really take their time about it and bold enough to make someone else's songs their own. For that's the true test of a musician--not whether or not they cover other people's work, but whether they put in the effort to give their audience something more than a tracing-paper copy of a song's original outlines.  By that standard, O'Riley's latest outing's a smashing success. It is a demanding listen--don't just pop in while riding the subway to work. I'm thinking headphones at home, late night, no distractions, just you and Chris and Chris's piano and Elliott's ghost.  On his previous outings, O'Riley had an easier task--on most Radiohead songs, lyrics and musical tone match pretty well. (Paranoid songs sound paranoid. Unhappy songs sound unhappy. And...well, that just about covers it, actually. Not that I'm complaining, Thom.) But what made Elliott special, among other things, was the way he so frequently married bleak lyrics about depression and addiction and self-loathing to poppy little tunes as radio-friendly as anything this side of the early 60s Beatles.  So O'Riley's opted here for re-imaginings that somehow capture the trajectory of the original songs while giving them the melancholy feel of Elliot's tragic lyrics and aching voice. (Check out "I Didn't Understand" or "Speed Trials" or especially the sad scared rumble of "Independence Day" if you want to know what I'm talking about.) As usual, O'Riley goes above and beyond the call of duty in scouring the back catalog for songs to play. (If you're like me, that means you might miss "Pitselah" but feel comforted that someone out there's a much more devoted and appreciative Elliott Smith fan than you'll ever be.)  It's a shame this sort of thing doesn't happen more often. Then again, there aren't too many modern musicians respectable enough to deserve the O'Riley treatment+music
smokin hot funkafized fusion+P+Rippington's during the period Moonlighting was made were the epitomy of Jazz fusion with latino flair. Fusion today is milk toast compared to this CD. "Soft Jazz"  has become the term for bands and artists of this genre, and it fits. All radio friendly and crossover hopeful. This CD smokes with vibes, fast guitar, syncapated rythyms, and memorable melodies. Toe tapping and should be played twice in a row to let it sink in. Russ Freeman is the most under-rated jazz guitarist of his time. He is never mentioned with Carlton, Rit, Lorber, Dimeola,etc..... He is a great songwriter and his music appeals to all that listen, old and young alike.....+music
Help Me ... I think I'm falling in love with ...+P+I think I'm following in love with JONI MITCHELL ... all over again after listening to this cd. For some Boomers there will always be songs from our youth that, when heard later in life, will immediately whissssssssk us back there in our minds. This Joni gem has plenty of those type songs. XOXOXO, Joni+music
The Sweetest of Symphonies+P+This album has it all. Utterly gorgeous. Bittersweet Symphony serves as a classic opener, complete with luscious strings. A perfect video clip to match too. Don't try walking down a busy city street while listening to the song. You'll start trying to imitate Ashcroft's negligent and arrogant swagger.  While Sonnet is sweet, The Rolling People and Come On are epic, angry, arrogant songs that just make you wanna sing out loud and just go off. It's an adrenalin rush in your ears....  Lyrcially, the songs are deep. Ashcroft is a fascinating lyricist, and his sentiments in Weeping Willow and The Rolling People are endlessly intriguing.  70 minutes long, but it's a soaring sensation. Every song has merit, even Neon Wilderness that is pivotal to maintaing the perfect flow of the album.  A must have for any one who likes British rock. One of the most important albums of the 90's..+music
No Sense of classics+N+I was lucky to have not wasted any buck on it.Thanks for the lovely service!the sample of 1 minute aimless lousing on note leaded me to an immediate decision+music
NOT ELEVATOR MUSIC!+P+After listening to this CD a couple times, I will be keeping it on my iPod playlist for some time. It will come in quite handy when I want to drown out the voices of people with "single phase" minds! Yes, it is supposed to be relaxing! Comparing this to Muzak is nothing short of ignorant! On a better note, I would tend to agree that Peter White is creative when it comes to mixing up his sound with other artists. Yet another reason to really appreciate the jazz community. If you are a Peter White fan, you will not be let down.+music
The best Supertramp live album even 25 years later+P+Supertramp's seventh album entitled Paris was released in October of 1980.  The album was recorded in November of 1979 in Paris, France at the Pavillion on the final night of the band's Breakfast in America European tour. Paris is a wonderful live set, capturing the band at the peak of their popularity when co-leader/guitarist/vocalist/keyboardist Roger Hodgson was still with the group. When you consider that the possibility of Hodgson returning to Supertramp these days very doubtful, Paris becomes a more important live document of the band, indeed.  Many great Supertramp classics are included in this live two disc set, such as most of 1974's grand breakthrough Crime of the Century(the spirited opener School, Bloody Well Right, Hide in Your Shell, Asylum, Dreamer, Rudy and the closing Crime of the Century which closes this live album), three songs from 1975's highly underrated followup Crisis? What Crisis? (Ain't Nobody But Me, A Soapbox Opera and Two of Us), two from 1977's Gold selling US breakthrough Even in the Quietest Moments(From Now On and Fool's Overture), and three from the #1 Multi-Platinum selling Breakfast in America(the monster hit The Logical Song, the title cut and the Top 20 smash Take The Long Way Home) plus one exclusive song called You Started Laughing which was not found anywhere else save the B-side to a song called Lady from Crisis? What Crisis?.  Hodgson and co-leader/keyboardist/vocalist Rick Davies sing their hearts out and play their respective keyboards with great passion, and Hodgson also serves up some incredible fretwork on the guitar. Co-horts John Helliwell on saxophones/clarinets/occasional keyboards, additional backing vocals and band MC(he does the stage bantering here, especially his humorous intro to Breakfast in America), drummer Bob C. Benberg and bass player Dougie Thomson have terrific interplay with Hodgson and Davies, helping to bring the band's great melodic music to life in tremendous fashion.  Just like on their studio albums, the band totally cook live in concert, too. The songs on here rival their studio counterparts, especially on Rudy which is played at a faster speed than the studio version on the Roger/Rick vocal duel section.  Paris did well peaking at #8 on the album charts(going Gold right away) and is one of my Top 10 favorite live rock albums ever, especially with the remastering on this album.  Highly recommended!+music
a sparkling gem in early progressive rock history+P+The album, "In Rock", by Deep Purple, was a milestone in early progressive rock history; a gem showcasing British hard rock at its best and an example of this particular genre that was strongly influenced by classical music.  It was the first studio album by a new line-up of the band that attained great success commercially, producing four(4) solid studio albums while touring the world almost nonstop.  The new members of the band were Ian Gillan on vocals and Roger Glover on bass, and what a difference their addition made to the sound of the band.  Just take a listen to the song, "Child In Time", a timeless masterpiece of more than ten minutes in length.  Just prior to releasing the album, "In Rock", the first studio album for this renown line-up of the band, Deep Purple recorded a unique presentation of their work with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.  The work was performed (and recorded for later album release) in September of 1969.  Entitled, "Concerto for Group and Orchestra", the work reflected the band's strong initial ties to classical music, and it was a wonderful foretaste of things to come.  It certainly drew attention to the band.  With the presentation of its first work together as a band at a prestigious venue, namely, The Royal Albert Hall in London, Deep Purple began to forge something new and worthwhile in progressive rock, a path that blended the unique talents of its members, all of whom were accomplished musicians.  Specifically, the band's music was highlighted, and driven, by organist Jon Lord; by the guitar of a true guitar virtuoso in Richie Blackmore; and now, by the strong vocals of a new member of the band, Ian Gillan, who oftentimes wailed and screamed to complement effectively the sheer volume of the music that his bandmates produced.  After all, these were the wonderful beginnings of hard rock in all of its glory!  Nevertheless, and astonishingly as it may seem, the band was not alone on this particular path in rock music history.  Other bands were likewise breaking new ground in 1969 in the progressive rock music field just ahead of the release of Deep Purple's album, "In Rock."  The Moody Blues were already well-established; King Crimson's initial line-up of that year would become a short-lived new-comer; and Yes, having had just released its second album, was still going through personnel changes.  Led Zeppelin, although not a part of the progressive rock music scene, was nevertheless establishing its name in hard rock in 1969, but the band was coming from a different direction musically, drawing its inspiration from the blues.      Another prominent band at that time in the progressive rock music field, The Moody Blues, also had an opportunity to record their music with an orchestra, specifically, The London Festival Orchestra.  The renown line-up of the band with Justin Hayward and John Lodge recorded their initial album, "Days of Future Past", with the aforementioned orchestra in 1967.  However, the band decided to play all of the instruments themselves for their second effort, namely, the album, "In Search of a Lost Chord."  Here, The Moody Blues played thirty-three different instruments, including the mellotron.  This relatively new instrument duplicated, to some degree, the wonderful sounds of an entire philharmonic orchestra.  Taking the mellotron into the studio, and afterwards, on the road, on the concert circuit, meant that the band was able to trailblaze, at its own pace, free from being dependent upon a philharmonic orchestra, its unique sound in progressive rock music.  As a result, by 1969, The Moody Blues had already established themselves as innovative musicians in the progressive rock music field and more, with the release of each new album, The Moody Blues continued to broaden their horizons musically and add to their ever-growing fan base.  Unsurprisingly, The Moody Blues broke new ground in 1969 with the release of two phenomenal albums, namely, "On The Threshhold of a Dream" and "To Our Children's Children."  Both of these albums are worth a listen.  Significantly, the popularity of these two albums marked a broadening acceptance in 1969 of progressive rock music, and in regards to The Moody Blues, the mellotron became an integral part of their music.  Nonetheless, the stage was set for the following year when the well-known line-up of The Moody Blues would release their fifth album, "A Question of Balance", continuing their strong ties with classical music, and Deep Purple would release their gem, "In Rock."  It is important to note here that Deep Purple followed a slightly different path from the one taken by The Moody Blues.  While The Moody Blues preferred softer sounds and vocals that produced memorable ballads and love songs, and at times, the band even added passages of read poetry on their albums, Deep Purple followed the direction of ever-louder music, levels that prompted its singer, Ian Gillan, at times, to wail and scream!  While Deep Purple headed towards the branch of progressive rock music that would eventually be labeled as "hard rock", The Moody Blues embraced an entirely different vision.  The band set the controls for their somewhat mystical journey pointed towards the heavens.  On this preset course, The Moody Blues, that is, their music and their lyrics, actually became, at times, heaven-bound, especially when their music was surrounded by, enriched with, and propelled by, the outworldly sounds of the mellotron.  King Crimson was another band that, at that time, was forging new paths in progressive rock music.  King Crimson made its public debut in the summer of 1969 at a free concert in London's Hyde Park with the Rolling Stones, and soon thereafter, the band released its five-song masterpiece, "In the Court of the Crimson King."  The album quickly became a true phenomenon, influencing many musicians at that time.  Like The Moody Blues, King Crimson used the mellotron; like Deep Purple, the band had a true guitar virtuoso in Robert Fripp; and like the individual members of The Moody Blues, King Crimson employed the services of a multi-instrumentalist in Ian McDonald.  Like The Moody Blues and Deep Purple, King Crimson was strongly influenced by classical music, but the band's music also reflected its ties to jazz and folk music.  Like The Moody Blues, King Crimson placed considerable weight on the lyrics of its songs, employing the noted lyricist, Peter Sinfield.  However, this initial (and stellar) line-up of the band was to become short-lived, and as a result, it unfortunately only created this one well-received album.  During this period of time, another band was likewise beginning its journey on a path that, with the passage of time, would prove to be extraordinarily successful.  The band was Led Zeppelin.  Like Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin's music was oftentimes loud, hence the label, "hard rock", but unlike Deep Purple and other progressive rock bands at that time, Led Zeppelin's music was based on the blues and, to some extent, on British folk music.  As a result, Led Zeppelin followed a slightly different path within the hard rock genre than Deep Purple, but its music had such an ever-growing appeal that its popularity influenced many bands both, established and those bands that were just starting out.  Like Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin had a true guitar virtuoso in Jimmy Page who, in the early years of the band, played his electric guitar with a violin bow as a novelty and also to produce special effects.  Much like the supergroup, Cream, that preceded them, Led Zeppelin continued to electrify the blues and while the band was reformulating this process, it began to establish its own style, a style that, along with the band, Black Sabbath, and several other bands at that time, began to mold yet another branch of rock called, "heavy metal."  Led Zeppelin released its initial album, "Led Zeppelin", in January of 1969, and its second album, "Led Zeppelin II", later in the year.  Both of these albums profoundly changed the rock music landscape forever that year+music
not her best+N+I listen to this cd because billie is my moms favorite singer and she heard this is one of her best boy were they wrong. Her voice is so bad becasue of all the drugs she has done and music is way overproduce. Billie was at her best with a more strip down sound with just a couple of musicans not a few blowed orcherstra. Fans like this because it is billie and if she sang the phone book they would by it and the fact that her life was just as bad as the songs that she sang. You make love a artist a whole lot but you got to admit when they have done something that is far from there best that does not mean that you should love them anyless. The one good thing about billie is that there is alot of her music to chosse from before you buy this+music
Over the shoulder boulder holders+P+I will cry at anything it seems, My Girl & Armageddon floor me everytime, and I sometimes even cry at Neighbours. So I just knew by reading the blurb of this, that I would cry.  It's amazing these days that a friendship can span three decades - so far my longest friendship has lasted nearly 10 years. And we've been through a lot, but never had a serious argument. As the old saying goes, guys, jobs, etc come & go, but friendships last forever.  In this, the friendship starts at the age of roughly 11, and the young actresses who play Barbara Hershey & Bette Midler's characters are excellent. The little actress who plays CeCe Bloom at 11 is the spitting image of Bette Midler - poor child! She's got the hair, the wide smile and the mannerisms down pat, and it's so funny to watch her. It's a shame Mayim Bialik hasn't done much else, it's mainly voice work she does now (most notably she voices a character in Extreme Ghostbusters.) They become penpals, and the relationship is played out through letters, until they finally get together. The film spirals from there, from husbands, to divorces, to arguments, to children.  It's predictable, and I did find Bette Midler's character just a little irritating, but that wasn't due to Bette Midler. It was just the way she played the character she annoyed me, she was so self centered. Barbara Hershey's character was fun, kinda the sidekick to CeCe, and Barbara actually got collagen injections in her lips to look younger, as she was playing her character through such a long period.  Of course you know Barbara's character is gonna get ill, but it's the way it's done, it's very subtle to start with, she starts looking more tired, and then it snowballs, and it's shocking how they manage to make her look so awful, she deteriorates really quickly, and I have to say the makeup artists did an excellent job there.  The funniest line in this film is my title for this review. "Over the shoulder boulder holders" is the perfect way to describe those annoying things called bras.  I've heard "Wind Beneath My Wings" many times before, and it's an extremely powerful song. What made a bigger difference was watching what was happening on screen, and listening to the lyrics, it brought a whole new meaning to the song, a meaning that I never got before. Well, that was me. Thankfully, I was watching this alone at the time, cos it would have been really embarrassing for someone to see me crying the way I did. To say Beaches had an effect on me is the understatement of the year. Even after I'd switched it off, I was still going about the house in tears. I'll never hear "Wind Beneath My Wings" the same again.  Unfortunately, I bought the bog standard, no frills, DVD, not realising that there was a special edition. But I'm quite happy with the edition I have. I'd probably cry through the extras too.  I'll probably watch this again (I still force myself to watch Armageddon & My Girl now & again, just because I love them that much), and I'll probably cry even more now I know what's coming. It's a terrific film, and is definitely the ultimate chick flick. It's also directed by Garry Marshall, so watch out for a cameo by Hector Elizondo+music
FINALLY a CD for people that are in LOVE!!!+N+Oh my goodness this is one the best CD's I've bought.  Finally a CD you can share with the one you love (I mean really love). This is not for boyfriend and girlfriend love cute-sy stuff...this is for serious lovers til the end, no matter what. I ain't there yet with anybody, but boy does this CD excite me to know I will feel like that one day. To think it was only $4!!! I would've paid had I known how excellent it was. Kenny and Chante celebrate love and so do I!!! GET this CD now!! and dance, laugh, kiss and "stuff" with your loved one!+music
70s pop reigns thanks to Alan, Wayne, Merrill, Jay and Donny+P+This release includes all ten of the brothers' top 40 hits from 1971 to 1974 ("One Bad Apple" through "Love Me For a Reason" and "The Proud One") plus two additional cuts: "I Can't Stop" and their version of "He Ain't Heavy." The 1992 greatest hits compilation on the Curb label is essentially the same disc minus the two additional tracks. "I Can't Stop" was recorded in the late sixties back when the brothers were regularly on television on Andy Williams' weekly variety show. The song was released after "One Bad Apple" topped the national charts. The flip side of that number one hit was their remake of the Hollies' hit "He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother." That tune was eventually covered over the next few years by many artists, including Neil Diamond and Olivia Newton-John. If you don't already own the 1992 hits disc or the three disc box set released in 2000 (also on the Curb label) then this is the compilation for you. You may also want to get your hands on the other two recently released "20th Century Masters" collections: one covers Donny's solo hits of the 70s plus the other disc features his hit duets with sister Marie from the same decade+music
Crime Boss is a disgrace to Suave House+N+This cd is maaad weak.  The beats are wack, the lyrics are wack and C.B. is just swinging on Eightball and MJG'S fame to get his cd out.  By this time this is an oldie but it is as bad today as the day it was released.  I  would sell mine if I could find anyone to take it+music
Gregg Allman Laid Back+P+Greggs first Solo Album. Cut in Capricorn Studios with a 19 year old Chuck Leavell on Keys is a superb LP. Re workings of "Midnight Rider" and "Please Call Home" are instant classics as is "Multi Coloured Lady" and Greggs gospel arrangement of "Will the Circle be Unbroken". If you love your music Heartfelt and Blues/Roots soaked then this is a must have..+music
Sophisticated orchestration, great voice, love the words+P+This was the most sophisticated popular music that I heard when I was young.  Joshua Rifkin, who also plays piano rags by Scott Joplin on another record, arranged and conducted this music.  "Both Sides Now" (win and lose are a strange trip in this song) was a hit on the radio for years, competing with "Walk Away Renee" and "Pretty Ballerina" by The Left Banke for best songs with harpsichord in popular music.  I soon bought THE JUDY COLLINS SONGBOOK with 55 songs that included eight of the songs on "Wildflower."  The first musical thing I notice about these songs now is how often I hear a trill or slower alternation between two notes.  The first song, "Michael from Mountains" by Joni Mitchell is in the key of E-flat, with a short introduction that repeats F G F G F G in the treble clef before Judy Collins starts singing those notes.  The second song, "Since You've Asked" by Judy Collins, which seems to be in E-minor, starts with an E and D alternating an octave higher over an E-minor7th chord, dropping through B-minor to a C chord with E D E D E D E in the octave of the voice being much like the introduction to "Michael ..." but with enough G, A sus.4, D9, A-minor7th, and B chords to have as much complexity as sophisticated people expect to hear in their music.  The words on such simple lines, "Take the lilies and the lace from the days of childhood, All the willow winding paths leading up and outward, This is what I give . . . " are as poetic as can be expected when people hardly listen.  "Sisters of Mercy" by Leonard Cohen is brilliantly done with flutes and French horns.  There is certainly more going on than I can describe.  Judy Collins had done "Suzanne" on an earlier album, "In My Life," and the combination of Judy singing Leonard Cohen songs worked so miraculously that "Wildflowers" took it in a very religious direction.  "Priests" has 7 verses, with the third verse:  And who will shoot the arrow That men will follow through your grace. And when I'm Lord of memories And all your armor has turned to lace.  The music seems a lot more complicated than a trill, possibly in B-flat-minor, with the notes between the staffs alternating between B-flat and A-flat three times per measure until the chord changes to C-flat.  If you have never heard "La Chanson des Vieux Amants" by Jacques Brel and Gerard Jouannest, you might not realize how sophisticated French popular songs had been before this album pushed American radio up to international standards.  Big bands had been popular once in the United States, and American music during World War II might have been as popular as anything the rest of the world had to offer, but I lost track of what songs great singers had to choose from after that, when Perry Como and Dean Martin could have used a few more hits.  There are some distinct instrumental voices which make the Brel song on "Wildflowers" interesting, but Brel often worked with Gerard Jouannest to achieve musical complexity.  So I suspect that this version is notable because Judy Collins' French is so beautiful.  The final song in her songbook, "My Father," (on the "Who Knows Where the Time Goes" album) is about "My father always promised us that we would live in France," and she sings like she wants that more than anything else in the world.  Contemplating intense desire is inspiring, but this song for lovers who have grown old expresses it sweetly.  "Oh, mon amour, Mon doux, mon tendre, mon verveilleux amour, ..."  "Hey, That's No Way to Say Goodbye" is a beautiful song by Leonard Cohen, soft with sorrow but Hey . . +music
Ho hum+N+Keller Williams is a fine FINE acoustic guitar player.  I can't deny him that.  However, after seeing him live, I can't say I will ever see him again.  Too much looping, too much cheese and not enough grit.  Light and fluffy.  Maybe you could call it bubble gum music.   I'm not turned off to the jamband scene.  That's not it at all.  I was a Phish fan for many years...going back to the late eighties.  I really enjoy improvisation.  My musical life revolves around it, whether I'm playing or listening, whether its jazz, free or jamming.  I love it all.  I just find Keller Williams and a lot of the bands (not that he's a band really) that are in the "jam" scene to be pretty boring.  At least Keller doesn't go on twenty minute quasi-bluegrass noodle jams+music
A Mandatory Slice of American Pie+P+All children, especially American children, should be introduced to the first two Boston albums at an early age.  They are among the best guitar oriented rock records ever in the history of humankind.  Fantastic guitar arrangements and tone, and otherwordly vocals performances by Brad Delp all captured here for our enjoyment in perpetuity.  You owe Tom Scholtz more money, and you know it+music
Should have read the 'dont' be scammed' review first!!!!+N+Okay, I too fell for this.....I was under the impression that this CD contained PRINCE music tracks.....NOT just a spoken word, unauthorized audio biography!!  Amazon's description should have made this clear, and I would not have purchased this item. +music
A great movie cast album!+P+I loved the movie, so I bought the CD to go with it.  This is the best version of Chicago ever.  Everyone can really sing and sing well.  I love Catherine Zeta-Jones!  She's fantastic!  Renee did well too, I was surprised by talent.  Richard Gere too amazed me with his talent.  John C. Reilly is absolutely AMAZING doing Mister Cellophane.  Queen Latifah was great as well.  If you're not sure which Chicago soundtrack to buy, I would suggest this one over the Broadway ones, unless you want all the songs.  They cut a few songs out of the movie, but it was no major loss.  This is a great soundtrack and highly recommend it to anyone!+music
Gang Starr's best work.+P+Gang Starr really put out some classic ish here. This is one of those albums that you may dismay as being sub-par, or even bad first listen if you arn't into underground, but you soon relize how this album is a gem. DJ Premeir, and Guru have been putting out classic material sence the late 80's, with there first full album "No More Mr. Nice Guy".  Premo is widely regaurded as one of the finest producers to ever grace the boards in hip hop history, and his partner in crime Guru is known as The King Of monotone Rap.  This is artistically a incredible peice of work. Guru & Premo put out a style of Rap that wasnt commen in the 90's, and is non-existant now! A Minimalistic Producer known for playing a melody of three keys, and a obsession for scratching teaming up with a monotone  soft spoken slow tempo rapper. Sound like a weird combonation right? Wrong... If Being a Hip Hop duo was a marrige Gang Starr would have been couple of the year for 10 years straight. This is the type of album you have to spend some time listening to, sure I have my favorite songs of the batch, but they are all solid, and the way Premo mixed together the songs, and even transitions is strokes of genius. Sure you can listen to "Im the man" 5 times, but you will get the full effect of "Im The Man" in the way Gang Starr men't for you to hear it if you listen to the tracks leading to it.  Everything seems timed perfectly. Strong in your face, phony rapper, and conspiracy theorys come in at the proper time for a full listen thru. The Interludes are also excellently timed. After hearing "Im The Man" you want something a little chill, & relax, so Premo follows it up with "92 Interlude" a soft short, but sweet 30 second paino riff. And even the intro is a great beat, than instead of it sounding like a new track they programmed it to go immediatly into the next track, cause the beats mix together. Guru lyrically is sharp, and he does not need much help, with only 2 guest appearences, and literally 2 guest appearences, sence premo controlls all the hook's with mastery Guru shows his lyrical powress, consistently spitting 30 plus bars in his monotone serious voice every track, except the interludes. In this album DJ premier seems to be the Architect, and Guru seems to be the foundation. Premier uses his mastery of beatmaking, programming, mixing, scatching, and especially sampling to construct a masterpeice around Guru's lyrics which are the foundation. Bottomline, you gotta pick this up if your a Hip Hop Head+music
ugh+N+i bought this cd based on the other reviews.  and when i got it, wow, i was very disappointed.  this cd is not good at all.  it may be good to those of you who like dashboard confessional and stuff like that, but it's not to my liking.  i recommend anadivine, coheed and cambria, or armor for sleep well over this cd+music
Sex, Beer and Pizza: the only things in life as good as Clutch.+P+Well, not much to say here. Neil (the bad man with a thousand voices) and company do exactly what the title says: they unleash Pure Rock Fury. Clutch is one of those bands where you can't just listen to two or three tunes off the CD; it demands to be played in its entirety while you and your friends are hopefully partying and freaking out because no band you ever heard in your life jams the way Clutch does. A lot different than the classic Transnational Speedway, but it's still Clutch and every tune is a ten out ten. Don't pass this one up. If you're new to Clutch and want to check one CD out before buying a bunch of them, get Tranational Speedway League first. After that you'll grab every other one: trust me. And don't forget to raise a glass of beer to the live version of Spacegrass on here!   Necrosoul.+music
Everyone please stop mis-leading people w/ 5 stars!!! It's about 2.5+N+Look, Zakk rocks. I've followed his entire career, so when I say Pride and Glory is weak, I mean it. The southern rock twinge is actually pretty cool and Zakk plays some nice solos on the softer tunes on CD. But it always goes back to the same thing for every artist--SONGWRITING. It's just not good here. Too many tracks sound alike and the songs are just thrown together. Track 5 is OK. Rest is mostly filler. Nothing you will remember 5 mins. after you change the CD. Sorry Zakk, but it sounds like you threw this together in 1 drinking binge weekend. Good move to kill the Pride. Now if you want good acoustic and blues from Zakk, get BOOK OF SHADOWS. It blows away this lame effort. Pride and Glory should only be purchased from the bargin bin. ROCK ON BLS+music
know the feeling of eating too much sour candy?+N+thats exactly how this album feels! you know, some irish songs and influences are good, but this is ridiculous. when 95% of your lyrical content is irish at least keep it interesting.(spicy mchaggis jig??? what the....?) so i say if your even interested in this cd or something 95% irish, get drunken lullabies or swagger by flogging molly instead, if you dont already have them. id also recommend the new murphys cd "the warriors code" if you want faster irish music done good. i give it 2 stars because its not nearly as bad as some of the other stuff out there. oh yeah rocky road to dublin kicks arse....thats about the only reason to even put this cd on. easily the worst DKM albu+music
This album is amazing+P+This is the greatest piece of music I have ever heard. Out of my 300 cds, I listen to it the most. It is great to work out to, to drive to, to do anything to. I've been listening to it for 12 years and still find sneaky little percussion nuances that I didn't realize were there. Everything else by Talking Heads and byrne solo, while still brilliant, is not on the same plane. Hilarious lyrics, irresistable grooves, totally original songwriting, white hot rhythm, a masterpiece. When was the last time a song made you feel angst ridden and ecstatic at the same time? "Something ain't right" does.+music
Powerful as the First+P+I have looked for this soundtrack for years and I was so glad to finally see it offered. I love the variations on the theme from the Omen II, such as the opening music from the movie, which is why I looked for so long. If you love powerful and furious music, this is for you+music
Release the movie score.+N+The score to Cast Away is one of my favorites - right up there with Ennio Morricone's underrated instrumentals for "Once Upon a Time in America" - and it's a real shame that, apparently, the only album with music from the film is this compilation disc which doesn't even feature the full soundtrack. Luckily I got my hands on an Academy Awards advance album preview for Cast Away - the CD that Universal sent to the Academy Awards crew for Oscar consideration - and it has six beautiful tracks. But I know there are more out there and I think it's time the full soundtrack was released+music
Great Overview (But Sometimes A Difficult Listen)+P+While the idea to make a collection of the fall out of punk and hardcore scenes in the 1980s after the great No Thanks box is a really interesting idea yet it proves extremely hard to pull off. Why? Well when punk became new wave and hardcore became alternative, you were left with so many sounds, so many viewpoints. While it totally made the music scene much more interesting compiling it to 4 discs makes it a hard listen sometimes because of that collage of styles. So its a great learning experience for the uninitiated to learn from, and its a great nostalgia trip for those who grew up with this music. For those of us in the middle we are left kinda scratching our chins and flipping over some of the tracks. I must say however that Rhino did choose the prime cuts from each group, and chose the right groups from each scene but thats what Rhino is great at archival material. Its by no means a bad box set in fact its really quite the opposite, but I guarantee even the most open minded listeners will find themselves hitting the skip button past their first listen+music
Not happy with CD+N+Receivied CD in what appears to be a scratched condition. CD won't play well in my vehicle... Almost appears to be a book leg version. Not happy with item+music
Worst band ever?+N+These guys are the biggest joke in rock music. All of these 5 star reviews are an even bigger joke. Ed Kowizsychik(SP) or however you want to spell it sounds as pathetic as he looks. This is garbage, plain & simple. Im glad radio is no longer saturated with their music. 20 years from now, no one will remember this group.+music
REBA'S LAST CD OF THE MILLENIUM IS UNMEMORABLE+N+Most of the songs here are ballads of which there are two that I really like:  "Back Before the War" and "She Wasn't Good Enough For Him".  The rest of the stuff here is unmemorable. +music
ANOTHER LET DOWN+N+Some songs are o.k. on this but not enough for me to give this CD more than one star.  Its just more crossover stuff. +music
long wait for nothing+N+Waited 22 days only to find the tape was the wrong format.30 days after i returned it was told not in stock.waited another 30 day for a credit+music
Amazing studio-CD of Zucchero+P+This is a studio-CD with more songs then on the live DVD of the ZU & CO performance in The Royal Albert Hall.  It is a pleasure to listen to the high quality songs (solo and harmony) of Zucchero with world famous artists like Sting, Mouse, Pavarotti, etc. Drive in your car for hours and hours listening to this CD and you never want to stop+music
Traditional Lullabies+N+The title is misleading.  This is a collection of New Wave renditions of traditional songs.  Unless you are a New Wave fan, it may drive you nuts.  New Wave adults may love it.  My baby payed little attention in contrast to  BabyGenius' &quot;Favorite Nursery Rhymes&quot; which clearly draws his  interest and smiles+music
Money is an issue, but not that much.+N+Pitbull's 3rd album from the 2004 M.I.A.M.I brings something at least different, though not much else, despite some good beats and some good songs, pitbull is just flat and distorted.  This is a somewhat album  Music Rating **1/2 Stars.  So a marginal thumbs down for me.+music
pure and perfect+P+Having traveled many miles going to bluegrass festivals in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, I have heard some great music. And the wonderful thing about the festivals, it doesn't have to be the headline stars that are so  good, sometimes the &quot;parking lot pickers&quot; are just as enjoyable.  But back to this, I love Ricky Skaggs, I love him for continuing to follow  a narrow path that he has chosen in the music business. that takes a lot of  guts, especially when all the glory goes to the hat acts+music
"Unreal....." review proves what I've said in previous reviews+P+Obviously Mr. T. Hardin is suffering from some musical mental problems. He would apparently refer the knuckle-dragging, amateurish, talentless stylings of the hundreds of bands that play the same three notes a thousand beats per minute while some oaf screams and growls unintelligible garble supposedly using all sorts of elaborate words for 'kill' that neither the band nor the fans know how to use or say properly. OK, now that I've gotten that rant over with, let me continue on to what you really want to read. This was actually the very first Manowar album I heard. A friend picked it up the day it came out, let me borrow it after he listened to it once, and never got it back (sorry Darren). I was forever hooked. The first half of the album is classic, well produced, straight ahead metal. Fantastic, clear solos on each song. The title track is a classic Manowar anthem. It sums up what they are quite well. 'Blow Your Speakers' is not only another trademark metal anthem, but is also the closest Manowar has gotten to an actual "hit" in the U.S. "Carry On", one of my instant favorites, is and inspirational rally cry; the kind Manowar is known for, among other things. "Violence and Bloodshed' is a fast and furious return to the Heavy Metal beginnings and Vietnam theme that hasn't been seen since the first album "Battle Hymns". All in all the first half of this album is just in your face heavy metal.  The second half is a return to the days of long, long ago. 'Defender' is one of the last things that the late, great Orson Welles ever did before his passing. I listened to this track at least 200 times in the first week I had this album. It aptly sets the tone for the rest of the record. A rich narrative that opens to a powerful crash of truly heavy metal. From this point on, this album does it all. Beautifully clear and powerful bass lines. Articulate and soaring lead solos. Earth shaking Drums. And the absolute best vocals on any recording of the time. 'Drums of Doom' pounds you into 'Holy War' like a charging team of mammoth beasts which then throws you into the 'Master of Revenge', a mystical segue into 'Black Wind, Fire and Steel' which blinds all with the relentless speed and accuracy of both music and lyrics. All done at a rate that almost defies logic. Manowar have definitely cemented there place as the Kings of Metal with this album forevermore. All those who refuse to believe it can go back their amateurs and goons. Leave us and make room for the true men of heavy metal.+music
underated+P+rip manpac you must not be a rap fan or a jayz fan talkin bout vol 3 was trash and the dynasty was worst u must like them franchise boyz cds or something cause them two albums are two of his best but anyway the dynasty was spose to be a compulation album thats the reason for the guess appereances but its a solid album on bad but underate+music
Shame there are no Negative Ratings, B/c it sure deserves one.+N+The production quality is almost as bad as the depressingly awful music.  Don't be fooled folks.  The "artistic" hacks may love it, but beauty is TRUELY in the eye of the beholder. If you enjoyed the awesome first 3 soundtracks; don't waste your money on this one expecting more of the same.    Instead you will receive a CD chocked full of unimaginative (i.e. high-schoolers without talent playing on their home computers) techno and "spoken word" type lyrics that are laughably bad (but only if you didn't shell out $13.99 to listen to them).  I'm now the proud owner of a $14.00 coaster, b/c that's about all it's good for+music
Blast beats from hell! +P+I must admit I bought this album for the cover alone.  I must also confess that I had never heard of Belphegor.  I was browsing a mom and pop record store looking for hard to find cds and in their new release section I came across "Pestapokalyspse VI".  Being a fan of death metal I decided to give it a try.  I'm always looking for new bands to get into.  I am very glad I gave these guys a whirl.   The best way I can describe the sound of this album is that is seems to be a strong combination of Norwegian black metal and death metal.    The heaviest aspect to this record in my opinion is the drums, there are ton of pummeling blast beats that are just relentless from these German dark lords.  As heavy as Belphegor are they also have a strong sense of melody.  After the first two tracks of pummeling death metal the band then slows down a bit with the track "Angel of Retribution".  There is some pretty impressive guitar work on this song.  There is also some really dark demonic like chanting on this record which to me Belphegor could write the soundtrack for an Omen film.   In my ignorance I thought this was new band but I believe they have 2 to 3 releases before this one.  After hearing "PestapokalyseVI" I would definitely pick up some of there other records.  My suggestion to anyone who is into death and black metal to pick this one up, Belphegor are a great combination of the two styles of extreme metal.  Some of the highlight tracks in my opinion are "Hell's Amassador", "Pest teufel apocalypse" and "Seyn todt in Schwartz".  This is must for any extreme metal head.  A brutal hidden treasure of 2006.+music
Music BAM!+N+The nightfox laser dance song without question is a sample/remix/remake/ BAM from a part of the score from the 1979 Italian movie, The Concorde Affair. Just saw it on 3-8-07 and saw Ocean 12 like 2 weeks prior.   No doubt it is the same thing only redone.  Randy +music
The Blac Monk Funk has arrived on the Scene!+P+I've been a big fan of Three 2's work as a Convict and w/Blac Monks, but dude def. can put it down on his own.  Took me forever to finally get a copy of this record, but it was worth the wait.  Plenty of laid back flow from Tre Deuce on beats from Houston legends John Bido & Mike Dean.  If you can ever manage to find this album for a reasonable price, i'de recommend coppin' it+music
Leaves a lot to be desired...+N+Being a long time fan of MLWTTKK, I immediately pre-ordered this tribute/remix collection. Upon hearing the first few moments of this CD, it was blatantly clear that whoever remixed these Kult classics had little regard for the originals' lustre. The mixes are light, airy.... pure fluff. Don't expect any chest-thumping industrial beats that TKK has delivered to its fans for many a year. The mixes butchered the originals to the point that it's not even novel, just cotton candy filler. How TKK allowed this malformed release is beyond me. The only purpose I see that this "tribute" could serve is to introduce TKK to a young lightweight, whose ears are not used to original industrial epics. Either that, or only for the hardcore TKK fan who just wants to have every release. The dust on my copy is already accumulating, and probably will for some time. If you're looking to dip your toes into My Life With The Thrill Kill Kult, don't buy this CD. Stick with the new greatest hits release, or better yet, start with any release prior to "Hit & Run Holiday"+music
Another Excellent Album+P+I have downloaded all of Black Label Society's albums, and even Book of Shadows and Pride & Glory, but this was the first album i bought in stores. I am a die hard Zakk Wylde fanatic, so, naturally, i love this CD. It combines Zakk's heavy riffs, with his soft melodies like the ones from Book of Shadows, and of course, his ripping solos. I believe that Zakk Wylde is easily one of the top 3 guitarists of all time. If you are a first time Black Label listener, however, I would not reccomend this CD. In order to fully appreciate Black Label Society, you need to start off with Sonic Brew, or Stronger Than Death. Some good songs on those CD's are: Bored To Tears, Lowdown, Beneath the Tree, 13 Years of Grief, and Love Reign Down.+music
A Great Compilation, with a few 'classics' missing+P+Decca has put together a wide range of early Jazz from a bunch of different artists; some with tracks you would not expect, which I suspect may have been intentional, the dates vary from 1929-1959, but the latter date is a bit misleading (see track list). There is no &quot;modern&quot; jazz here. It is also a self-admitted limited survey, due to the label. Men like Ben Webster and Johnny Hodges are not represented due to the fact that no solos from any Decca, or Decca owned subsidiary, were deemed proper examples of either. But what is included is always classic, even if not the most obvious candidate for the artist. Making up for any shortcomings in that regard is the 79 page booklet included, which is really half the presentation. Well done, informative, and richly packaged, it is a great companion to the disc, and a great gift idea for a jazz aficianado+music
Bollocks to this+N+This ranks right up there with the Blondie reunion CD as completely unnecessary.  Why?  These guys are RELICS.  And I wouldn't care if the music was great (i.e. Joe Strummer &amp; The Mescaleros new stuff) but this  is just awful.  Why are they still trying to act like jittery teenagers?   And the Spedding songs here are just wretched, at least the Shelley-penned  numbers are merely bad.  By all means, buy Singles Going Steady or  Operator's Manual, as they are priceless landmarks of punk rock, but leave  this Modern dreck in the rubbish tin.  I picked it up for half-price and  should have known better+music
It's hard to believe they are still around.+N+I liked it better when it was called Alice in Chains!!!!!!!  They should call their band Zapsmack because I would slap the piercings off the singer if I ever saw that 90 lb. wuss.  Songs about witch craft and all that lame hocus pocus mumbo jumbo is about as played out as King Diamond.  booooooooooooooo!!!!!!! this band.  The Zappe+music
Great Vocals, Very Good Overall Sound+P+This is the first Plumb CD that I have purchased.  I suspect it won't be the last.  The vocals and overall musical quality is appealing and quite catchy.  The lead singer's voice is really very good.  Lyrically, it is good.  Most of the songs are not very clearly Christian.   One exception is their remake of Michael W. Smith's 'Pray For Me', which is great.  Others have lyrics that occasionally allude to Christian topics such as, 'I Can't Do This'.  There is one line that says, 'I can't do this.  I can't do this by myself.  Oh God, I need your help.'  In spite of the overall lack of Christian oriented lyrics, which I prefer, there is nothing objectionable about the wording in these songs.  I will likely check out another one of their CDs.  This one is very good and seems better each time I listen to it+music
sad and sick+N+I bought this cd because I heard Blood on motorway, in a commercial. I thought it was a hot jig. Will, It wasnt like the commercial. I wasnt expecting Suicide lyrics and empty crys of the synthesizer. It was a waste of my 14.99 and Im resaling it+music
The best of all+P+I have heard several Bohemes in my time - my favorites being the versions with Pav and Freni; Tebaldi and Bergonzi; and this one. Neither of the first two can match this recording in overall effect. Karajan with Pav/Freni, while firmly in possession of his own wonder, misses by a hair Beecham's sensuous conducting logic. Also Pav is not the best Rodolfo: he sings too opulently to convey a blue, starving poet. The Tebaldi/Bergonzi set is a sure contender, and might have stood right with this one if its sound weren't so bad.       Now as for this set itself - three words say it: Bjoerling with Beecham. These were two of the finest artists of the last century, and it is a blessing to have this record of their collaboration. Jussi, while perhaps not as romantic as Bergonzi, was a Rodolfo for all time. That ringing golden tenor truly could build castles in air. And hell, he was romantic enough for comfort. Add Beecham, and, if you please, you've got glory. His pacing is perfect. Just listen to about midway through "che gelida manina," where Bjoerling soars and Beecham expands the tempo to let Jussi's voice raise the rafters and burn deep. And I tell you what, Jussi could burn. The quantity of air that man had was astonishing at the least, and he didn't waste it: his phrases are easy, well-drawn, and thrilling.      I have no important complaints about anyone else in the cast. I actually prefer de Los Angeles's Mimi, though I think she sometimes doesn't support high notes with enough air. As for the orchestra, there are a few mishaps where accurate entrances with the singers are concerned, but that is hardly surprising - the ensemble was assembled in roughly two days and its memebers had barely played with one another or with Beecham. The sound of the set isn't as good as one might expect from the Great Recordings series, but it is acceptable, and a well-informed ear can fill in any lacking overtones.  Buy it. You'll love it for many years, and then pass down through your family+music
BLACK PEARLS: essential Coltrane album+P+wow. a truly underrated album (considering that i'm only the 5th person here on Amazon to review it) and one (of many) of Coltrane's true genius recordings. the playing here is jaw dropingly amazing and tightly focused. the compositions are fast fast fast and executed with confidence, style, and unlimited class. highly recommended for lovers of great jazz and amazing music. highly recommended+music
The Chrysler...+P+Definitely one for all time...when I first heard 'Raised on Robbery' (on the radio, in Omaha, NE of all places), I immediately had images of a dashing Cary Grant, Gary Cooper type, dressed to the nines, cooling his heels with a Rob Roy in the lounge of the Chrysler Building, not 'the Empire Hotel' replete with all that glorious, stainless steel, polished oak and mother of pearl, art-deco; set in a slight, yet crisp, sepia tone, black and white...Joni painted all that in my mind in 32 bars, then here comes the lady 'in lacy sleeves'...she's a trubador not unlike Dire Straits, Mark Knopfler, a story teller of the highest order and an artist with no peer.  Buy it+music
return of the frog queen+P+this cd is as good as people say it is.  if you're a fan of enigk, you wont be disappointed.  make sure to pick up his new album "world waits", its just as goo+music
WHAT A SHAME...+N+THIS MAY BE A GOOD SOUNDTRACK, BUT WHAT THE HELL..I'VE SEEN THIS FILM A HUNDRED TIMES, AND I NEVER FROGOT THAT SONG WHEN HE WAS RIDING IN THE HELECOPTOR ON THE WAY TO VIETNAM.I COULDNT REMEMBER THE NAME OF THE SONG AND FORGOT WHO THE ARTIST WAS.SO I SEARCHED ON THE CRAPPY INTERNET.... FOR OVER AN HOUR MY POOR TUSH HURTS, AND I FOUND NOTHING, AND IT'S A CLASSIC SONG!!!!! SO I THOUGHT TO MYSELF MY BROTHER MIGHT KNOW, SO I SAID TO HIM, REMEMBER FORREST GUMP WHEN HE WAS IN THE HELECOPTOR AND THE SONG WENT "THERE MUST BE SOME WAY OUTTA HERE" AND IMMEDIATELY HE SAID JIMI HENDRIX, ALL ALONG THE WATCHTOWER.... SHAME SHAME WHOEVER PUT TOGETHER THIS SOUNDTRACK NEEDS TO BE SMACKED UPSIDE THE HEAD.. WHO WOULD FORGET JIMI, AND THAT BEAUTIFUL CLASSIC SONG. NOW I KNOW, NO WONDER I COULDNT FIND IT. IT AINT EVEN ON HERE! AFTER ALL THOSE CLIPS I LISTENED TO. WASTE OF TIME, PLUS WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT TO JIMI FANS.+music
Crazy S@#*!+P+This is a perfect example of modern heavy metal. After realeasing their first album in 1998 and gaining a small cult following, System of a Down broke through to the mainstream with Toxicity, an album even crazier than it's predecessor, with tricky time-changes, funky drum patterns, fast guitar riffs with odd tunings, and politcal lyrics sung in such a way that it almost makes light of the world's problems. Where their first album is heavier, this one is more complex. You can find yourself in a groove, only to have it change, and seconds later have it change again. There are lots of mosh-worthy moments, and parts that sound almost middle-eastern due to Daron's style and unique tuning.  This album takes a while to get used to, it changes quickly and frequently. John is an amazing drummer and I feel he is too overlooked and doesn't get the recognition he deserves.  The lyrics have a purpose, at times they will make you think, and at times they will make you laugh. These guys are serious, but don't take themselves too seriously.  In my opinion this is their best work and is a must-own for any Sytem fan or metalhead in general, though it may be a little too crazy for some people.  System of a Down on this album is:  Serj Tankian - Lead Vocals, Keyboards, String Arrangements Daron Malakian - Guitars, Backup Vocals Shavo Odadjian - Bass, Vocals John Dolmayan - Drum+music
Bill Evans He's Not+N+In his interminably boring, mice type liner notes, Brad Mehldau goes to great lengths dispelling the notion that he might sound like Bill Evans. The message being, `Oh golly, there's so much more going on in my playing-Please.' Well, I can assure you, Bill Evans he's not. He wouldn't qualify to give Bill Evans a cab ride uptown. Matter of fact, he sounds more like watered down Keith Jarrett-nothing very original going on here. And if you need 10,000 words of liner notes to explain what you're doing-guess what-you ain't doing squat. As a pianist who's been playing modern jazz for 40 years, I can tell you to sit this set out. And if you want Bill Evans or Keith Jarrett, go get the real thing.+music
A let down+N+The writing needs some work.  This album probably won't see significant rotation in my playlist+music
5 Stars because it's Lemon,  but not the best sound+P+Blind Lemon Jefferson was the greatest of the country bluesmen.  (For a measure of my enthusiasm, see my review of the Yazoo set.)    If you dig him enough, or are curious enough, to want his entire output in one place for a budget price, then by all means this is the package to buy.  But completeness and price are the top virtues of this set.  If you want to hear these records at their best, with careful attention to making them sound clear and present, the Yazoo one-disc compilation still leads the pack, far and away.  Except for a slightly better mastering job, these four discs mirror the four separate BLJ volumes on Document.  In fact, I would not be surprised to learn that these _are_ the old Document masters, run through a noise reduction system.  The sound quality is quite uneven:  the better-sounding takes sound pretty good, but some of the others are awful.  The version of " 'Lectric Chair Blues," one of Lemon's finest records, as heard here is terribly worn and noisy, to the point of being unintelligible.  Also true of the same track on the Document.  On Yazoo, it's a wonderful listen and you can hear and understand all of the words.  "Long Lonesome Blues," take 2, is also nearly inaudible.  On the Yazoo, it sounds as if they may have been working with the same 78 disc, but the results are much improved.  JSP Records gained a stellar reputation because its earliest roots-and-jazz compilations were mastered by the late John R. T. Davies, who was a genius at resurrecting old recordings and making them sound real.  But this is not one of those sets.  So:   With Lemon Jefferson, you always get quality music, and with this JSP collection you get nearly all of it.  (Several alternate takes are not here.)   But if sound quality is an issue, I have to recommend Yazoo's "Best of.+music
A New Talent+P+Although Elisabeth Withers has appeared with lots of well known people this solo album is a rare talent to behold. A good blend of slow relaxing music & mid tempo R n B, she surely will go on to greater things from her+music
The magnificent one, the beautiful one, the one and only one...+P+This album sizzles with energy, honesty, and "I'll MAKE you pay attention" entertainment spirit.  This was his big breakthrough album and it's not hard to see why.  Every single track is excellent, and each very different from what went before.  From start to finish, the emphasis is on simple Beatleish rock arrangements, played with finesse by a great backing band, with the piano front and center.  It starts off with plain rock and roll - Moving Out, with its thumpy rhythm and brilliant ending.  The Stranger (apart from its stylish intro and outro) is a bit more funky, with a lovely bridge/chorus.  The much maligned Just The Way You Are suffers from a bit of cheesiness in production (Billy Joel calls this "Phil Ramone's Bossa Nova version), but is still a good heartfelt song for his first wife (whatever happened to her anyways?).  The centrepiece of the album is Scenes, this is Billy Joel's tour-de-force to show everyone what he can do on the ivories.  Vienna is a beautiful ballad, and Only the Good Die Young is a hilarious dance tune, still racy 30 years later.  Always a Woman is played a bit stiffly on piano, and borders on cheesy lyrics, but still a great tune.  The next two tracks are a *bit* weaker, but have their moments and are still brilliant songs, just in comparison with what came before...  He came close to topping this album on Glass Houses but this still stands as his finest album.  If you're going to have just one of his albums, I would recommend this.+music
Masterpiece Revisited+P+Stunningly beautiful. Coltrane plays his heart out, as does McCoy Tyner. Bonus tracks are fantastic+music
BODY LANGUAGE+P+I LOVE IT!! BUT THEN AGAIN, I LOVE ALL HIS CD'S, HE IS THE BEST AT WHAT HE DOES! HAVE SEEN HIM SEVERAL TIMES IN CONCERT, AND IF YOU EVER GET A CHANCE TO SEE HIM, DO IT !! IT WILL BE WELL WORTH THE $$+music
PHENOMENAL  EVERYTHING!!!+P+Unbelivable!!!  buddy rich is the master when it comes to drumming!!!   This CD is filled with many solos... not just from the master, but also from others in the band.  he had by far the best horn section in the the world and it is definitely captured by this AWESOME cd.   I find NO problems when it comes to sound or anything else.  If you like jazz, druming, solos, or just buddy rich, you NEED to get this+music
Great re-issue with extra niceties...+P+I've been listening to PT for several years now, and have found their music most moving.  I really wouldn't care if they sound like Pink Floyd, or whomever.  I don't believe that Steven Wilson sits around trying to imitate one group or another.  I think it could be said that most artists have their influences from many sources, from many inspirations.  So, thank you Steven for re-issuing this CD, and adding such quality and care to the songs.  I believe you will influence many other future artists with your creativity.  You certainly influence me to listen and enjoy.  After all, my son and I travelled over 150 miles, one way, just to see PT in Michigan, and thoroughly enjoyed every minute of the concert+music
Terribly Dissapointing+N+Now before you shrug me off as a hater...I just want to make it clear that I love Rob Zombie...I am more of a White Zombie fan because they just have so much more going on in the music and lyrics than Rob has even come close to with his solo endevors. White Zombie made some of the most amazing music of the 90s. I like Hellbilly Deluxe, it's a very good album, not near as tantalizing as anything White Zombie did, but still very good. This album however is a complete departure from everything before it. The only good tracks are Sinners Inc & Transylvanian Transmissions, what some would call "fillers" a labeling i despise, these 2 tracks are amazing, and the ozzie track is alright, but everything else is just mindless ramblings and power cords rolled into a brainless shpeil of banter about nothing. I so do not dig this whole poppy thing hes doin in the slightest. Hellbilly deluxe is a far supirior album, while this album is not even worthy of being compared to anything White Zobmie did. Alas Rob...what happened? Why God? Why? But dont take my word for it...listen to those cuts from the tracks amazon posts. They all suck. Nuff Said...Rob...your next album better kick ass, thats all i gotta say+music
Yep, it's amazing...+P+What more can be said?  This album blows so many great albums in rock history away.  I became a fan of Dishwalla when I was 15.  I bought their first CD like a week before Counting Blue Cars started getting airplay everywhere.  But ever since I got this amazing CD I have just not enjoyed Pet Your Friends nearly as much as I used to.  That's not trashing Pet Your Friends.  This album's just that amazing.   +music
Why waste CD time on remixes and omit "Careless Whisper" is beyond me+N+Gee,the CD seemed fine. My favorites are here. "Everything She Wants" (original),"Freedom","Young Guns (Go For It)","Where Did Your Heart Go?","Careless Whisper"...hey,wait a second..."Careless Whisper" ain't on here. The ultimate George Michael/Wham! ballad and this is supposed to be a greatest hits album and that song missed? "A Different Corner" also? Because of stupid remixes of "I'm Your Man" & "Everything She Wants"?  Huh,I rather listen to ANDREW RIDGELEY's solo album than those remixes. Really! Psyche+music
Don't Forget Ruth Brown; a 50's Great!+P+Don't ever forget Ruth Brown, one of the greatest female rock singers of the 1950's. She had the two minor hits on this CD, Lucky Lips and This Little Girl's Gone Rockin', but there is so much more. Every cut on this CD is an absolute winner. She is greatly overlooked but I think she tops Etta James and LaVerne Baker. This is a terrific CD and she is the best+music
all the songs sound the same+N+I think all the songs sound the same and like she is trying to sound like Avril. +music
You want to know the truth in life...+P+...don't pass Tower of Power by.  This band is smokin.'  They have it all, great vocals, great compositions, great horns and arrangements.  I would have loved to see Man From The Past on this one, but overall a very solid collection.  So Very Hard To Go is top notch material - one of my all time favorites and they have so many great tunes - Below Us All The City Lights, Down To The Nightclub, What Is Hip, This Times It's Real, Only So Much Oil.  Easily one of the best bands from the 70's.  Got to have this one+music
Typical Greatest Hits (Not)+N+As with most Greatest Hits collections, the record company leaves off just enough hits to make you wonder &quot;What they were thinking?&quot; They also put on a few tracks that make you wonder &quot;What were they  thinking?&quot; Here, there are some obscure tracks that clearly are  &quot;filler&quot; while omitting some of his best tracks from rock radio  and even Top 40 Hits? Where is I Found Somebody? (Oops, that was only his  first Top 40 &quot;hit&quot;) Where is &quot;Partytown&quot;? (Probably his  best party song and a big hit on AOR radio in the early 80's). &quot;Don't  Give Up&quot; was also a rock radio track and a great song from his first  album. I would title this album &quot;Some Hits, Some Mediocre Stuff, Some  Stuff Sorely Missing, Sorry.&quot; Now, where is that Eagles box set we  have been waiting 20 years for+music
Should've researched it more...+N+After much much excitement and almost 20 bucks layed out I was extremely disappointed. The music was really slow, boring and rather dull. The songs start to seem like they're the same as the lack ones. Maybe I'm just too used to other trance but I couldnt' find any trance in this cd+music
Buy this version!!+P+I owned this (the movie version) years ago as a record and loved it.  Then I got rid of my records and switched to CD's.  After several years I was missing my Camelot music.  So I bought the Broadway cast version with Julie Andrews & Richard Burton (how could I go wrong?!?).  I was quite disappointed and over the next couple years only listened to Camelot, perhaps, once more.  Finally, I realized that I needed to buy the movie version of Camelot with Vanessa Redgrave and Richard Harris.  Wow, I am delighted once again!!  Now I find myself humming the songs and looking forward to hearing Camelot again.+music
I've just heard the best!!!+P+My wife and I just returned from the John Jorgenson concert in Jonesborough, TN.  We agreed that neither of us expects to ever hear a finer guitarist!  We bought two of his CDs during intermission (including Franco-American Swing).  As much as we will enjoy listening to them for years to come, nothing will replace the rare privilege of "seeing" this master play.  The experience can't be described with words.  The audience even gave him a standing ovation at the intermission of his two set show!  And two more before the end of the evening's concert. Buy this CD ... you aren't likely to regret it.  And check out his web site www.johnjorgenson.com to see if he is playing anywhere near you.  It will be worth the drive to catch his show. +music
One And Only Michelle Tumes+P+Although not as beautiful as her previous release(s) this album is still a triumph of beauty.  Her voice is still undeniably pleasant here, and every song has its strength.  Personal highlights include 'The Light', 'Image Of' and 'Blessings Flow'.  Certainly a complete change of style from her older work, but still more than sufficient for any Michelle Tumes fan and anyone into Christian music+music
Robbie does Madonna and Eminem?+N+Yuck. On first listen, this album sounds like Robbie trying to do Madonna and then Eminem.  The vocals are monotonous, the beats the same. It's dance music, and not my cup of tea. I'll give it another listen, but I'm guessing there will be maybe 2 songs I'd want to keep on this cd. Pau+music
Sloppy Mush+P+This review concentrates on the four live tracks.  By December 1970, Miles Davis' fusion was evolving even beyond the Bitches Brew era. The emphasis was more and more in the rhythm, and less and less on coherent solos. Miles Davis stuck a wah-wah pedal on his horn, getting a sound that was thin, whiny and rather annoying. Keith Jarrett and Michael Henderson joined the band, lending the band a unique keyboard sound and a funkier bass respectively.   Live Evil basically consists of several edited jams from the Cellar Door recordings of December 1970.   SIVAD: The recording begins on a high point; vicious funk punctuated by Airto Moreira's squawking Cuica, and stabbed through with Miles Davis' electric trumpet. This is actually a version of "Directions" by Joe Zawinul, although the tune is so evolved it is basically unrecogniseable. The statements of the theme have been excised with a razor blade. Miles' horn is electric, and its sound is a mixture of Birth of the Cool and Axis: Bold as Love. Truly strange, and frankly not a very nice sound.  Three and a half minutes in, the groove shifts to "Honky Tonk", a minimalistic and not very inspiring theme. The performance is sellotaped together from two separate live performances of the tune (!) and one studio version! Miles sometimes plays with an open horn on this section; and Airto Moreira makes weird wailing noises that sound rather corny. Sloppy and shapeless.   WHAT I SAY: A feature for Jack de Johnette, a terrific drummer. The groove is extremely harsh and energetic, with Miles soloing with an open horn. Unlike the other tracks, this is actually a complete performance (segueing into "Sanctuary" at the end) and is quite impressive. I really like Jarret's electric piano/organ solo and Johnette's drum solo!   FUNKY TONK/INAMORATA: In which Teo Macero goes nuts with the scissors. This is actually one big slab of a performance, cut arbitrarily in half to fit both sides of an LP. And it is not one piece of music, but three: 1. "Directions": Yet another performance of Zawinul's piece. Much more conventional than the "Sivad" version, though again with all the statements of the theme cut out. Miles soloes with electric trumpet.  2. Then the groove shifts to a piece which resembles the Mission Impossible theme! So this is where they got that theme. The name of the tune is sometimes called "Funky Tonk", and sometimes "Inamorata". A very long, sloppy, shapeless morass of solos. Again, Jarret's solo is most beautiful.  3.Finally the groove shifts to "It's About That Time" from "In a Silent Way". A performance that does not shift into the second bassline. Halfway through a gloomy voice narrates a weird, associative poem about the mysteries of Music.  At the fade-out, you can hear the groove shifting to "Sanctuary..."  Overall, the album is extremely messy, with a good deal of self-indulgent excess masking some excellent soloing. Atmospheric and very dense.+music
I did not like it+N+I was not feeling this album at all which is strange because I like Mac Dre and Dubee quite a bit.  I was not feeling the tracks.  It was too funk oriented, with some dumb sounding tracks.  It was not the smooth type of production that I expected to hear coming out of Vallejo.  A big disappointment+music
A Big Letdown+N+The debut Blues Traveler CD was truly fascinating.  Great jams fueled by some catchy songs such as Gina, But Anyway, Warmer Days, and Sweet Talkin' Hippie.    This follow up Travelers and Thieves CD has many good jams but many unmemorable tunes.  As talented as the instrumentalists might be, after a while the endless noodling gets a little boring if a good melody is not present.  All In The Groove is possibly the only piece with a noteworthy melody.  Mountain Cry is not bad in the background with some good vocal interplay between John Popper and guest, Greg Allman. In time I could appreciate it a bit more.  Onslaught is semi-memorable if a bit chaotic.  However, the overall impression is that of boredom.  The tunes all seem to blend together with little in the terms of variety and even originality.  Even Popper's harmonica blasts get wearisome midway through this CD.  The discriminating fan will choose the first CD, Four, and Straight Until Morning and pass on this mess. +music
Don't Expect Hip Hop & You'll Be Fine...+P+Reading all these reviews, you've got a whole buncha people bashing on this CD because it's a dance album.  Well, to all you that don't know Norman Cook, AKA Fatboy Slim is in fact a dance artist who produces dance music, don't go into this album expecting anything different.  Mr. Cook is a genious and his singles time & time again are proven not only to be sucessful, but also timeless(aside from the tracks that the top 40 radio DJs get ahold of and cram down our throats a zillion times until we never wanna hear 'em again...  Thanks for that by the way, you're doing the world a great service).  As far as not understanding "Star 69",; what is there to understand.  "Star 69" was made for one reason & one reason only, to make you shake your butt.  If you're looking for meaning in music, go listen to Yanni, or Enya, or Celine Dion, only listen to Fatboy if you wanna boogie to the MFin' oogie.  As far as the guy bashin' "Bird Of Prey", it's Jim Morrison dude; what more do you need.  For those of you who don't know musicians outside of the Backseat Boys, Jim's the lead singer from The Doors, & one of the few truely brilliant musicians of ours any other generation... ever.  Basically I'll put it like this, don't bash on the man because you're to sheltered to understand good music unless it's played for you twice every hour on the hour on the radio or MTV.  Cook's music'll be around alot longer than any one of your 1 hit wonder's out there.  Just because Norman makes his own music, & not from some mold given to him by some slimey record executive doesn't mean his music is bad.  If you don't get it fine, but don't bash on something just because you're to shallow or close minded to understand.  Open your ears and give it a shot, your brain will thank you+music
Really dissapointing+N+His previous album "You've come along way baby" was so good and original but now it seems like he's spending more time on his music videos then on the music, many songs on this Cd are also based on samples from older songs like "Star 69" and "Weapon Of Choice" and "Sunset" some say he's matured as a artist but when something worked pretty good why don't continue in that way instead of making the oddest songs he could think of. Norman Cook is a dance artist and there's no way he should try to do something he isn't used to. Bootsy Collins "Weapons of choise" and Macy Gray "Love life" is Cd, so does the Voice of Jim Morrison on "Sunset" but they cannot save this album from fiasco, to me it feels like the guest attists take too much place, it's no longer so much of the original fat boy slim sound here. "Yo Mama" got a cool sound though, but he could have tried to do something more with that song. "Song for shelter" is dark and slow aswell, think he even released it on single. Let's just wait for a better time, this album was really a flop+music
Pleasingly Melodic,  her best  work yet!+P+I have follow Ana throught her beginnings as a member of the Spanish pop band Mecano and became very intrigue by her angel like voice and absolutely progressive themes in her earlier years with the band.  I very much  anticipated a new release from Mecano but when I heard the band had split  up assumed that her career was over.  I was very delighted to hear she had  went on as a solo and knew that her new CD would probably become a new  classic in my CD collection.  I found every song in this release as  pleasing as all her former recordings+music
Awful mastering muddies up a truly great album+N+You'll see other postings here that discuss the details of what Capitol's engineer did on this 1998 release to reduce hiss, etc.  Believe it.  Compared to the 1991 version of the disc or the better Mobile Fidelity gold disc (1990) this version is awful. It's like a bucket of mud was dumped over his vocals. There  are a bunch of threads on this topic on the forums of Steve Hoffman, one of the best sound engineers in the business. But the bottom line is most people who care about this music would like to see Capitol go back to the original master tapes and treat Frank right. The mastering issues apply to a lot of the 1998 Sinatra discs labeled "Entertainer of the Century" on the side+music
For American twenty-somethings+N+A relentlessly trendoid pastiche intended for the North American kewl market.  It cobbles together the offerings of many fine and varied artists, but the association implies that there is a "new thing" here - in the sense of the original bossa nova or tropicalia, which isn't the case.  Rather being something new, it is an example of unassimilated influences.  Some North American influences have been "eaten," perhaps especially by artists connected with Bahia, but that's not really on the table here. Virginia Rodrigues career has been stalled from day one because she is essentially unable to use her great voice - she simply can't move her butt stylistically - thus, her inclusion here is a bit of unintentional irony.  Brasil has a tremendously complex folk and pop musical reservoir and a sophisticated modern music industry - this stuff is definitely not the sharpest tooth of the cutting edge+music
No Good At All+N+Completely worthless! If you liked the film, go buy the DVD because this album has no redeeming qualities.  The sound quality is fair at best, even for a live album.  Almost every track is jammed with totally worthless `commentary' at the beginning or end of the song.  The `commentary' consists of recordings of about a dozen people having random conversations over the phone and laughing for no reason.  It would have been nice if they had put these `commentaries' on different tracks because the way they have it on this CD you have to wait through about a minute and a half of this crap to get to the song you want to hear.  The worst part about the album is the lack of The Fugees, which means no `Killing Me Softly'.  Sadly, you can tell that most of the artists on this album haven't played a show or practiced in a long time as they are a bit rusty and sound horrible, even for a live recording.  Some of them sounded almost as bad as Fallout Boy on SNL+music
Recycled goods+N+Having listened to Steven's previous albums, Greetings from Michigan and Seven Swans countless times, I cannot help but to notice the amount of regurgitation on this album.  Stevens blatantly rips off his own music.  I consider Michigan to be Sufjan's masterpiece.  Do yourself a favor and start there+music
TICKED OFF+N+I bought this cd after hearing Tony on one of the am morning shows, and really likings some of his past offerings, but I have to say that this cd was the pits and a waste of my money.  I was ticked off to have bought this cd from a talented brother and not have gotten my money's worth.  Tony has been on the scene for quite a number of years, and I expected a more mature offering from him than this latest.  There is a great lack of maturity on this cd, and it's an overall disappointment.  Unfortunately, I have to say here that Toney is not alone.  What on earth possessed veteran soul singers the O'Jays to sing a song like Let's Ride?  Who are they singing about girls their granddaughters ages?  Hoochie mommas?  What?  Babyface?  Even he gets in on the foolishness of trying to sing like the hip hop crowd!  And what's up with the explicit lyrics?  We all know you can curse like sailors, but why is this language necessary in music?  And I know that artist have always performed their music, but will someone tell me why it's necessary to perform with so few clothes on?  I would rather hear your music, not see your booty! Sorry, but a review I just read triggered me, and I'd been thinking about the Tony Terry cd for a while.  Hope he comes up with a more mature offering the next time.  Meanwhile I think you're safe in skipping this particular cd+music
Better Stoned?+N+Um. I have nothing against bands that are "mainstream". That has nothing to do with their quality of sound. (granted, many mainstream bands are horrible, but they all deserve a chance, no?) Dave, though, he has never impressed me. Not that he's awful, I suppose it's okay background music...better than nothing. Just oh so mediocre.   I don't understand why is he so highly praised? Voice-wise? Eh. Nothing special. Lyrics? Hah! Music? umm... bland? it's all the same! Maybe I'm missing something?  If you like one of Dave's songs, then by all means, buy this! You can be sure your money will be spent on nearly exact replicas of that song.   Two stars because it's at least music. But that's on the high side, considering how static it is. Dave will never find a place in my cd player or in my computer.+music
Born to Croon+N+Jeff Buckley sounds like what Marc Bolan would have sounded like if Bolan had taken Perry Como as his musical muse.  Seriously, think about Marc Bolan trying to sound like a '50's crooner and you'll know what Jeff Buckley sounds like+music
Juelz should be missing his tongue+N+Yes the game has been missing the constant songs about drugs, girls, cars and jewelery. I tell you Juelz really came with an original formula with this album. The stuff he mentions on this one has never been said before and Juelz is an innovator as well as the rest of the dipset. LOL!!!! These guys listen to other peoples albums and just reiterate the same stuff in a different song and beat. Save your money+music
Not a Tribute+N+Any one who is a fan of Luther Vandross will be sorry if you purchase this CD.  It's not a tribute.......it an abomination+music
Terrible garbage.+N+Anyone ever see any of these rap "artists" perform live? They're the most boring, derivative "entertainers" in the world. They walk up and down the stage grabbing their crotch and YELL their lyrics. They go from talking on records to yelling on stage. Quite a stretch. All this is done with about thirty of their no-name friends prancing around stage with microphones saying "YEAH!" "UH-HUH!" "WHAT!" "THAT'S RIGHT!" "UH!" etc. Get real.  Meanwhile, the only "music" provided is a backing track cued by some dude backstage. It makes for the most dull, predictable "concert" you'll ever see.   I can't wait until all this nonsense just disappears. In a world of common sense, these idiots would still be flipping burgers at McDonald's. +music
Simply dull +N+Dull and uninspiring, listening to this CD I couldn't see what distinguished the Doves from the other insipid sound-a-like bands that plague the modern music scene. If you like The White Stripes, Franz Ferdinand, Arctic Monkeys, The Killers then be grateful that they've saved rock music from boring dross like this+music
another loser band+N+Hooba...stank...stinks and will always stink. I don't know about the rest of the CD, but listening to The Reason is about as pleasant as sticking your hand into a running garbage disposal.  I'm not a perfect perrrrsssonn. Egad+music
one of prince's worst albums!+N+although prince is an utter genious! this cd is merely a boring contract filler. i suggest you buy one of his older albums or the new album "musicology" instead+music
When something is already the best don't change it+N+Just listening to the samples of this new remix of "GOLD:35th Anniversary Edition ~ The Carpenters" I found it to be in my opinion sadly remixed very badly. Certainly not a tribute to the excellent talent Of Karen Carpenter and Richard as well. I wonder what Richard was thinking when he remixed these songs? As another review noticed and I agree with, is the bass on some is so loud it almost drowns out the pure excellence of Karen's deep resounding truly perfect voice. This is not a CD you want to get if you really want to appreciate the true pure sound of The Carpenters. The older CDs (if still in production or if you can find them used) "Carpenters Classics 25th Anniversary" a 2 CD disc 98:04 minute Collection remastered digitally, is a much better pick. Especially for those who remember The Carpenters when Karen was still alive and the original arrangements were nothing to mess with. The other CD's worth finding of The Carpendters especially if you like the Talent of Karen's deep resounding perfect voice, would be The CD "Voice Of The Heart" This is a hautingly beautiful collection of Love songs by Karen who lets each song touch your Heart and Soul making you feel as if you were right there as she sings each song. The other one I would highly recommend, if Christmas is your Holiday, would be "Carpenters Christmas Portrait"... "Special Edition digital version....Celebrating 70 continuious minutes of the Seasons best..." with Karen and Richard. There are 34 Carpenters songs as timeless as their sound,and 11 performances heard on this Holiday CD for the first time. These CDs are all the songs you fell in love with the first time you heard Karen sing. These are the arrangements so beautifully done with her and Richard. This new remix maybe OK if you have not been familiar with how wonderful the original songs The Carpenter's recorded and later remastered-Not Remixed- sounded. For this reason I give this 35th Anniversary remix a 2 star rating. These older CDs are how The Carpenders really won over their fans, took the Music Industry by storm and gave a generation of Music lovers reason to Love The Carpenders music and the sound they gave each song. Talent that can still win over anyone who truly appreciates the timeless talents only The Carpenters could deliver. As I more or less said in my Title for this review and taken from an old saying "if it ain't broke don't fix it!" or in this case Don't Remix it! +music
Lightning don't strike twice, does it?+N+When it comes to Big Star's 70's output, you can call me a HOPELESS FANBOY, because after listening to In Space, it seems that ONLY a hopeless fanboy would think that thirty-some-years later, exactly one-half of the classic Big Star lineup could---or in forever difficult Alex Chilton's case, WOULD be so inclined---to attempt to recapture the lightning-in-a-bottle transcedent pop magic that made those 70s discs so great.  This disc has WAY MORE in common with Chilton's oft-times difficult, mostly self-indulgent solo work than with any of Big Star's previous fascinating pop near-perfection. While I'll admit that I have enjoyed a good chunk of Chilton's solo work, (in a slightly guilty, rolling-my-eyes, "Oh...that Alex!" sorta way...) my musical sensibilities are somehow offended by the fact that THIS group and that THIS particular collection of songs are presented as "Big Star."  In Space is connected musically to the original Big Star by little more than the fact that two of the same guys in THIS BAND were in THAT BAND.  If you don't expect much, you won't be disappointed.    +music
Curious...+N+The music on this album is performed so exquisitely; the orchestrations so subtle and yet illuminating, that one is almost tempted to forget what a "What for?" musical this is.   Donna Murphy plays the title character of Fosca, a hugely unprepossessing woman who suffers from more maladies than there are stars in the sky. She lives in a remote miltary outpost where she falls in love with the handsome, virile Giorgio. Giorgio in turn is having a torrid affair with the beautiful, but vapid Clara, a married woman back home. However from the time Giorgio comes into Fosca's sphere, she becomes this relentless succubus in her pursuit of him. She shows up EVERYWHERE he happens to be; her ferocity matched only by her inexhaustive capacity for self-pity. To depict Fosca musically, Sondheim comes up with the most monochromatic score of his career. Everything is SO lugubrious, dark, portentous, tragic; punctuated by militaristic strains (with snare drums)because the soldiers like to...umm...march.  In the end, Giorgio is worn down enough by Fosca's attentions that he succumbs. He believes he has fallen in love with her, shortly after which she...dies.  As I mentioned earlier, the material is beautifully performed (Marin Mazzie and Jere Shea render the opening "Happiness" with a marvelous sense of delicacy and sensuality. Donna Murphy evokes the proper pathos in the haunting "Loving You."), but you come away wondering what the point of it all is. If Sondheim is trying to show us how love is largely a chronic disease, then he succeeds admirably+music
This is just a pathetic follow up.+N+Am I The only ones who actually liked nelly's first album, I Thought it had charm, style, grandier to me and kind of scale and kind of importance, you thought it mean something, but this is just a lame gimmick from the start, I Mean there are some moments and some good songs (including the sexy and very funny music video hot in herre with cedric the entertainer), but the rest are just horrible, there is nothing else about this album that I Can engage with nor cared about and who cares?  Country Grammer was funny and good, this one's an utter disaster.   One of the worst albums of the decade.+music
Bubble gum rap+N+Nelly could make the wort rapper sound like a lyricyst, and how dare him to diss KRS-one, he just said the truth and he really did not diss him on Number 1, he just added to why he sucks. Lets face it, all his songs are basically dumb and and really don,t have much texture involved. And how funny is it that his friends really have no skill and they are all over this album it is just laughable. If you buy this album, you throw away good money. Unless you like bubblegum rap. This is more for a teen white girl who wants to be cool, but lets face it ,its played out+music
Leonard Cohen: I am your man+N+It is bad! As much  as I like "10 new songs", this one disappointed me a lot.+music
The Decadent Downfall Of Mainstream Hip-Hop +N+I find it utterly disturbing how simple it is for a talented D.J. to round up 3 bafoons and exploit their childish and idiotic personalites all for their dirty dollar; Ripping off the kids droned and purged on the MTV feedbag, and this man Paul Wall probably gets under my skin more then any of them.  Notice his rhymes don't descend any futher than his mouth, his car and his money. What excactly does that say to me about my life or the world around me? Does it reach artistic heights?  Or is it just another jackass looking for his 15 minutes of fame?   And still people eat it up like Chicken N Dumplin's on a cold winter's day  This is excactly whats very wrong with today's hip hop, it's all capitalizing on mindless club music artistic talent is down the toilet infinitely  Stay away from this awful garbage  don't let MTV rob another cen+music
Unfortunately Clay has become a Vegas lounge act+N+With much anticipation we awaited the arrival of Clay's second album, thinking this one would make the career of one of our favorite singers... and instead we fear that it is likely to end his career.  While Clay's voice still sounds great, the CD is an entire collection of uninspired, underproduced remakes ... not one of which goes beyond the original.  As you can see, this CD is nowhere on the billboard charts, and we're very sad to say in our household, that it's for good reason.  Save your money and buy one of the much better Idol CDs ... and almost any of them are, most recently Kelly Pickler and Carrie Underwood.+music
Least Favorite Edwin Album+N+Although it KILLS me to write anything less than glowing about Edwin McCain (I think he's probably the most talented singer/songwriter we've seen in the last ten years), I just can NOT get into this album.  Like others have said, I too have every Edwin album and have seen him in concert. I love everything he's ever done.... but this album just doesn't do it for me. And I know people will say... "Give the album a chance"..... or... "Let Edwin grow and move in new musical directions". BUT..... I've listened to this album at least 10 times all the way through and it's just not growing on me. It feels "flat" and just doesn't feel EDWIN-ISH (if that makes any sense). Even Grammercy Park Hotel, which I saw him debut live and which is on his live DVD doesn't feel the same on here.... just doesn't have the feeling or soul.   I would pick up Austin Sessions over this album any day. THAT is Edwin doing what he does best. Maybe he feels the pressure to write some "hits" so that he doesn't have to spend two solid years on the road in the Black Pearl (his tour bus)..... and who could blame him??? But this feels like he's trying too hard.  I SOOOOOO hope he comes back with a better album next time, so I can rave about it, because although I gave this album 2 stars.... Edwin, as a person/singer/performer/songwriter deserves 10!!!!!!+music
Turn off the tv on the radio!+N+This band is getting alot of critical acclaim right now, but I'm just not feeling it. The single "Wolf like me" is the only song that stands out to me on the whole album. It is a great song, but everything else is just blah. I think the band could use a different singer, the guy they got doesn't sing very well or very "soulful". The music is good, very original and the only reason I haven't sold the cd yet. I really think ppl need to hear this one for themselves before they buy. Don't be fooled by these 5 star reviews. Just listen to the cd before you buy it. That's my advice+music
Win some. Lose some.+N+You win some and you lose some. This purchase was a definite loss. What a dissapointment+music
Humbly and Honestly I don't like it+N+It really doesn't appeal to me. But if you like them that is your opinion. I'm not going to say your stupid for liking them because your different from me. But I just feel that there is way to much cursing for my liking I mean the creativity here is not very high I just feel you could use better words. But I mean THE MEASURE OF A MAN IS NOT HOW MANY GIRLS YOU SLEPT WITH. I mean that is how you lose money on child support. Sex has never been the most important thing in life.  Honestly though I mean you just can't see these guys rapping about these same things when they're 40 right cause that is wrong. I mean why be interested in a group of rappers that in 10 years probably wont be making music anymore let alone still be together+music
Another Retarded CD From Another RETARD!!!!+N+DIS GY IS DA KYING OF DA SOUTH!!!   Give me a f***ing break. When are we going to stop seeing crappy rapper after even crappier rappers that are so full of themselves that they feel the need to plasture their faces all over every one of their crappy unintelligent so called albums!! Nothing descent to say at all, just a bunch of mindless [...]. I bet you they don't even like music, they just want to be a "celebrity"  and be rich for 3 years(till their broke). If they really did geniunly like music, it wouldn't sound that sh**y!!!! GET OVER YOURSELVES!!! +music
Wasn't That Funny+N+I gave this a good listen, but did not find it all that funny ... or memorable+music
and the most generic music award goes to.......+N+one word.  generic.  terrible.  boring. (well, they are all one word)  people must learn to have a better taste in music.  granted there is at least one good song.  a few others are decent, but only because there are no vocals.  if you have heard any new band for the last 3 years, you have heard pulse ultra.  my friend likes breaking binjaman (another uber generic rock band in my book) and he listened to 2 songs from pulse ultra and said "thats enough".  do yourself a favor and buy a GOOD cd.  when will people learn!+music
Man f*** damn near all these so called hits.+N+The most untalented producer in the business. Honestly the only tracks that shine is all the ones with Biggie and Black rob's only one hit. The rest of this is trash. Especially those chickenheads Total. And once again Puff tryin to eat off Biggie carcass. Dont give this bum anymore money, Just listen to Biggies two gems and "f" the rest+music
Too much of the same+N+After Norah's first two CDs and the Little Willie's CD I was greatly looking forward to this release.  To say the least I am disappointed.  I was listening to it on my commute home and had to switch to something else to keep from falling asleep.  Where is the range of work?  All of the songs on this CD sound very much the same and nothing really stood out to me.  I'm giving it 2 stars just because of Norah's angelic voice, otherwise I'd have to give this one a 1 star rating+music
Supergroups are super bad!+N+I hate it when rock stars form those g0d awful "supergroups".  Can't people see that putting a whole bunch of different people from different bands together in one band is just a marketing scam and nothing more?  There's no such thing as a good supergroup.  The Supergroup is the only kind of band that deliberately tries to $uck.  When Damn Yankees released their 1990 debut, every song on it was so incredibly generic, there was no hope for this band.  The whole album seemed rushed and thrown together.  They had nothing meaningful to say with these songs, it just seemed like they were pumping out filler and hoping somebody would be stupid enough to fall for their "supergroup" scam.  The big, booming, arena rock choruses just ring hollow.  I guess they're trying to be catchy and have memorable hooks, but to me, it just sounds like a lot of filler.  Supergroups will always suck, because they diliberately try to sound bad!  Thats right people!  Supergroup members know that since they're already popular, the album they're putting out is guaranteed to be a big seller----"Why bother trying to come up with good songs?  We're already popular, so people will buy it no matter how bad it is! Lets just put out filler."  Supergroups are a TOTAL farce, its just easy money for the people involved, and nothing more.  If you buy ANY album by ANY supergroup, than you my friend, are a sucker!  If you want to hear Shaw or Blades at their best, just keep listening to any Styx or Night Ranger album, and avoid anything by Damn Yankees, or any other supergroup+music
Not good+N+When Mike & The Mechanics ushered in the `Madchester' scene with The Living Years it was only a matter of time before these jokers attempted to jump on the bandwagon. If you want to be adored you should write some decent songs lads! Verdict: don't waste your money.+music
cure for insomnia+N+this is no SAW 85-92 as some people compare it to. Oh, no. This is a largely unfulfilling listen. The tracks all sound too similar. I realize Richard's concept was to just utilize anlaog gear, but the drum programming and harmonic "development" is lackluster. Only track worth burping over is the last one... XMD something. Has he been taking piano lessons since Druqks? For those that want some new electronic music that packs a punch, check out Nick Forte's new release "young man's disease" which is better than anything else i've heard this year.+music
Great Price...Not so good itself+N+This a great priced cd, but the content is why it is so cheap. It's a true-amateur album. Beethoven Lover is over her/his head. This is the real world, not a fantasy-everyone-likes-every-type-of-music world. Deal with it and agree with me. It isn't so great+music
Overrated????+N+Who could like a band like The Rolling Stones? They are not the world's greatest rock band and they never made anything good but Start Me Up and Shattered. Their new album is the most horrible CD I have ever heard. Stay far away from that CD. Get anything from the Stones that contains Start Me Up or Shattered insted.+music
Worst album EVER!!!....+N+let me first say this, Roots is basically Paul Simon's Graceland, except nu-metalized. these guys went to south america, cut a couple of terrible tracks with "natives"?, then filled the rest of it out with generic nu-metal crapola with that guy from Korn cut and pasted into the mix for good measure. this is a particularily bad example of the vile and thank-you-god-in-heaven-it's-dead Nu-metal genre-meaningless pissed off lyrics, excessive "guesting" of other crappy artist, bad guitar, bad sitar(!), and the inclusion of anything to do with Korn, all presumabely done with band members sporting loinclothes and Rambo style striped face paint. the biggest waste of time, money, and matter. Its a shame that these guys are living and breathing and taking up space and resources that someone else could be using. A real bummer. +music
Elvis has not made an exit but he has left the planet+N+Good music but a bad title!  Elvis has left the Planet but a new King has been born with the self proclaimed new King of Rock and Roll Ken Rondell at http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/bigra+music
Not Worth The Money!!!+N+As much as I like most of the songs on this CD...it's just too short. Also the production is lousy.  The recording quality sounds awful in places. Hopefully, the updated compilations are better. This one is not worth the money!!!+music
What Is The Sound Of One Oar Flopping?+N+There's a reason Oar flopped when it was released back in 1969: it sucks.  Thirty eight years later, with Skip Spence safely in his grave, some now give this pitiful mess *five* stars.  Since you can't give more than five stars here, they're saying Oar is on a level with masterpieces like Sergeant Pepper... Dark Side of the Moon... Led Zeppelin 4....!  Just between you and me, I think the government is still secretly drugging people.    With all due respect to Skip's venerable memory, Oar is a painful aural experience.  The first two tracks, Little Hands and Cripple Creek, are halfway good, and show some production values; but things quickly deteriorate from there.  One gets the impression the rest of Oar was cobbled together in the recording studio just prior to taping - then put in the can after only one or two takes.  Lastly, the bass playing and drumming are just awful.  Yes, it's too bad that things ended up like they did for Skip. And it's hard not to sympathize with him - he flew high only to crash hard.  But let's keep a sense of perspective: His tragedy did not translate into good music.  One extra star in his memory.+music
My hips don't lie either... and they know this music stinks+N+Every one is obbsessed with "Hips don't lie". Don't they relize that the songs horrible. Well, so is every other track on this album. Save your money to waste on something that is atleast some what decent+music
VERY BAD, MUSIC FOR PEOPLE WITH NO TASTE+N+I HATE THE BEATLES. THEY ARE AMONGST MY MUSIC GUIDE TOP 20 WORST BANDS EVER. THEY ONLY MADE A FEW DECENT SONGS IN HEY JUDE, LET IT BE, AND BALLAD OF JOHN AND YOKO. REST OF THEIR SONGS JUST STINK! EVEN A MARK KNOPFLER CD WITHOUT DIRE STRAITS IS BETTER THAN THIS! LIKE I SAID, ANYONE WHO LISTENS TO THE BEATLES OR ZEPPELIN DON'T KNOW WHAT GOOD MUSIC IS ABOUT, HUH!!! GOOD MUSIC IS REQUIRED DIRE STRAITS, GREEN DAY, FOREIGNER, GNR, METALLICA, AND NIRVANA. GET ANY ALBUM FROM THOSE BANDS INSTED. THE BEATLES SUCK!!!!+music
Retire PLEASE+N+I used to like Rob Zombie, up until Hellbilly Delux.  Everything after that is garbage.  This album is no exception.  Every song sounds the same and is very predictable.  The lyrics are nonsensical, Educated Horses?  He says that phrase in like 3 or 4 songs on this CD, I think he is running out of material and throwing crappy CD's together to scrap in some extra money.  He needs to quit before everyone forgets he used to be talented.  I don't recommend this CD to anyone except the die-hard stalker-type fans that will buy all of his CD's/merchandise regardless.  1 star, I went through this CD in less than 10 minutes, very disappointed, and will never put it back into a CD-player again+music
!?!?!?+N+I think someone forgot to tell Molotov that Rap-Metal/Rock-Rap was Dead. Had potential, but the simple riffage and annoying rapping killed it for me+music
South Pacific+N+The CD came as promised and in the condition promised.  I'm very satisfied+music
Overrated!+N+Certainly not deserving of the Grammy (for cast recording).  Each of the other nominated productions is MUCH BETTER than this poor excuse of a revival.+music
poor recording!!!+N+I bought this CD only yesterday.The recording level is too low and I could not listen to the performance even with the volume cranked fully up.Rather than going in for another high wattage amplifier I decided to return the CD!!+music
Garofalo is funny+N+The best scene in the movie is the Italian restaurant scene with Janeane Garofalo, using a wry Randy Quaid as her foil when she's not ignoring him.  It's the only scene that made me laugh.  The scene with the playboy dad having three women in his home, and the one preceding it when his girlfriend's excessive dinner fails to impress the little kids, are both weak.  Playboy dad is not interesting, and that character really shouldn't have been one of the three musketeers of this movie.  The other dad, Reiser, is uncomfortable to watch.  His dinner scene with his daughter is good in the sense that it shows how estranged a father can be with his teenage daughter, but that too is uncomfortable to watch.  The later scene, up in the treehouse when his daughter suddenly loves him, is completely unbelievable.  The fact is, that particular girl would not say those things to her dad.  She doesn't love him.  She doesn't need him at all.  She's done with him.  The stupid bit about Randy Quaid being a talk show star after busting into Rob Reiner's talk show is just dumb.  That doesn't happen.  If you want to write a cartoon, get Warner Brothers to draw it for you.  Have the Road Runner in it, or Bugs Bunny.  The film gives us comfort food at the end, with the trite and meaningless advice to love your kids.  The fact is that your kids need love from their father when they are young, but once they hit a certain age, in double digits, you are done.  Daddy just becomes the source of cash from then on.  Kids in their teens and twenties don't want or need anything but money from dad.  Fittingly, I saw this film on Father's Day.  To sum the whole movie up, Janeane Garofalo is funny, Randy Quaid is kind of comfortable to watch although the script gets a little stupid at the tail end, and the other two male leads are just mildly annoying.  The script doesn't say anything worthwhile about the subject it took on.  But it takes a subject on, so at least that's something.  It gives exposure and food for thought on the subject of how a father fits into his family+music
He is OK+N+I do not like Parker's style at all.  I can't really say anything else.  It is all in the way you format a song, and I just don't like parker+music
UGH!+N+Another unspeakable album from the most unspeakably overwrought, over-produced and over-rated rock band of all time.  Did I mention over the top? Let's face it, Queen was a group of crypto-fascists, working hard to put a human face on Thatcherism.  Ghastly stuff.  K.+music
AC/DC ripoff+N+this guy sounds worse than brian johnson does now. why can't people my age stop copying the past? be original. that's it. this style is well worn out.+music
I hate it !+N+I am wondering WHEN this plague will be over.... and WHEN we'll be set free to listen to real music... We all are so tired of her +music
Bad diction, engineering gimmicks besot otherwise noble effort+N+A tenor very quickly on the rise, this is Villazon's second recital disc, one devoted to arias by Gounod and Massenet, all in sets of three, three for Massenet, and two for Gounod.  While still showing great promise, some concerns that were mildly serious with the first disc are even more so, in the French repertoire, in part because diction comes up so short here.  "O souverain" from Le Cid continues to show Villazon's command of line and squeezed but adequately forceful upper register, so that the volume boosts from the control room are really unnecessary.  Diction here is already an issue, as many `u' vowels get dipthonged, especially when Villazon's sound is placed back for added weight and volume.   `La reve' from Massenet's Manon is comfortably floated, with support from Natalie Dessay as Manon enhancing the intimacy of feeling to this number. Would Villazon been able to sing the short aria by Alain (who appears to the heroine at first to perhaps be little more than an apparition - shades of Frau ohne schatten perhaps? - in almost a chamber opera), from Massenet's Griselidis (track 8), at least as softly and lightly, as both the music and dramatic situation require, this could have also been very successful.  He instead turns the ABA shape of this mere chanson inside out and makes a wreck of it.    The less often excerpted "Lorsque enfant" from Werther closes out the first Massenet set, as does "Pourquoi me reveiller" the second.  Villazon's identification with the distraught main character of this opera is abundantly clear in both.  He capitalizes well on the quixotic emotions and dreamy tendencies of the distraught main character especially well in the first selection, and he is also less intruded upon by the producers or sound engineers there as well.  It is quite curious how the control room follows the tenor up a crescendo on a line that closes out the first section of the excerpt here from Massenet's Roi de Lahore, featuring a hero (from Hindu myth) that bound to certain stipulations, has literally returned from the dead.   Not quite as ostentatious as Massenet's near remake of Lohengrin, Esclarmonde (but with female protagonist instead), it is one of Massenet's most colorful scores. It has only been recorded complete once commercially, with Joan Sutherland, Luis Lima, and appearing only ten minutes apart, James Morris, and for the part of General unfortunately eliminated from this scene here, John Tomlinson, along with one other cut to Villazon's part.  It would've been more valuable to have all this complete instead of one or two other arias.  He captures the incipiently worried tone of Alim well, but his coloring up the vowel sounds makes it seem that he has come from a place as remote from French culture as where the opera takes place.  Most successful of the Gounod selections are two of the three rarities.  The first is Source delicieuse from Polyeucte, based on the Corneille play.  It opens very well with a minute of orchestral cortege.  It perhaps has only been recorded once before and well, by Roberto Alagna ten years ago; Villazon conveys the heroism of the piece somewhat well, if not as securely as Alagna.  Anges du paradis from Mireille (which Mirella Freni championed and recorded complete for EMI), is third, perhaps a study for Ah leve toi, soleil (Romeo), several years down the road.  The second Gounod rarity on this disc is "Inspirez-moi, race divine," said to be a Caruso favorite, from Reine de Saba.  Its text indicates King Solomon's prize hired builder, Adoniram, to be a very confident, if mildly haughty chap.  Villazon's interpretation seems to portray a hero that constantly has to look behind his back, with all the incipiently yet controllably vibrato ridden throb and backphrasing Villazon engages in here.  The high C at the end, however, is convincing.  Such device as in the above, also accents and colors most phrasing in the tomb scene from Romeo et Juliette.    "Ah! leve toi soleil" opens the first Gounod set, and is sung with the right ardor, conventionally marked by tiny captured scoops, coming off phrases.  Villazon's entrance and two later lines catch for having placed so far back in the throat, and intonation gets momentarily derailed.  "Salut, demeure" from Gounod's Faust quickly becomes expressively leaden and monochrome.  Recitative and the beginning of the aria, "Ah! fuyez" from Manon begin well nuanced enough, and for the aria, truly softly as a change from so much else on this disc, but all-purpose bench pressing and volume boosts intrude before long. That leaves two truly atmospheric selections from two Massenet rarities, to close this recital - first, an aria from Roma, Massenet's swan song for the lyric theater and "Ah! parais" from Le Mage, opera with plot line similar to that of Verdi's Aida, following.  The melody, introduced by the cellos at the outset for the latter, somewhat takes after "Pays merveilleux" from Meyerbeer's Africaine, but in more voluptuous color, such as in Thais, and Villazon and Pido both capitalize well on its opulence.  Pido's work, on numerous other numbers on this disc, seems heavy, lumbering, cloying, or just simply out of his idiom, so to speak.  Word has it that Villazon, while not having a big voice, is dramatically exciting on stage and probably more immediately engaged with the content of what he is singing.  How this picked up a major award from Gramophone, for the specific problems this disc has, and over two more qualified nominations (Ciofi/Di Donato Handel Duets and a Florez album) is mystifying. So much digression here is over the very specific demands that French opera makes on singers. There's much reason for hope for this tenor, but this disc, for two-thirds of it, does little to help fulfill it+music
Disappointed+N+The music for the soundtrack was so lame!  I though I was gonna cry cause I figured this was the end of B2K by this point.  The s'track wasn't even all B2K either.  I like the song with Jhene and Omarion "Happy".  Also I liked "Out of the Hood" other then that it was boring. +music
I GIVE THIRDS 2+N+I bought this cd for one song, &quot;Walk Away&quot; which was one of their best known songs. I was hoping since that particular song was so good that maybe the album would harbor a few more gems. There wasn't. The rest of the album is like an anti-climax. I would suggest a greatest hits instead. If you see this cd just turn your pretty head and walk away+music
Not as good as the origional.+N+So Far, So Good...So What! (in it's origional form) used to conjure feeling.  The remastered edition sounds like a group of studio musicians tried to remake the album and just didn't quite hit the nail on the head.  If you bought this album on cassette when it came out in the late 80s, get your hands on that version. +music
Glorious Lack Of Sophistication+N+Deep Lyrics man, I'm getting a lot out of this... But just wait for the next record when you'll get &quot;Hold On Loosely!&quot+music
Know the label...+N+I didn't listen the disk but know the recording label. Never heard anything good produced by the company in several occasions when I was hooked by the low price: very poor immitations. Just go for the real things+music
Absoulutely rubbish, which you could find in your bin the day you buy it.+N+Let me tell you, Shayne Ward is just one of those pop singers who only go by looks, if he looked like shrek he would not be anywhere today, face it girls your only buying this because you fancy him. Look at Justin Timberlake, where is he today, they go and move on, and thats what Shayne will do except alot faster. This song is so rubbish, the thing I hate so much is that he didn't even write this! So its not his own material, and let me take you in on a little secret he does not care about this song, its not like these lyrics mean anything to him, as he did not write. And on "No Promises" thats even worse than this, yes he might of wrote it I don't know, but does the song have depth, or is it just a plain old expected pop song. By the way it's the second one. Shayne Ward has no protential, neather does anyone who comes of X Factor, its all just one big [...+music
Not my cup of tea+N+One good song, of course "The sound of silence", and the studio version is far better than this one. I am not a fan of the genre as you might expect+music
gag+N+These guys are not artists. They are unimaginative lamebrains unwittingly and badly rewriting already overplayed music from a long dead scene. It's like a few monkeys build a house, and all the other monkeys rave about it, but in reality the house is just a banana tree with a welcome mat... whatever that means.  I am constantly astounded as to how waste like this gets on the radio. Buy this cd if you want to vomit everywhere.+music
Great music in search of great mastering+N+While I doubt I'll EVER get used to the edited (single?) version of 'Nights In White Satin' presented here, I have to agree that the song selection in general is excellent for a compilation of this seminal band.  That said, The Moody Blues (or more likely, their record label) haven't exactly been shy about releasing such anthologies and hits collections on CD, either.  While 'Gold' represents an affordable means of buying some of the best known and loved music from The Moody Blues, it also is for me one of the most trying listening experiences as well.  If I had to guess, I'd say much of the music contained on 'Gold' comes from different masters than the songs currently found on other collections, and on the band's original CD albums.  There are definite issues with the sonic quality of these songs as presented on this disc.  For instance, the music track of 'Nights' is horrendously compressed in comparison to earlier CD versions of this song; perhaps the record label was working with an unremastered single release master of the song (my guess), but the audible discrepancies between this version and earlier examples (albeit, in the full album form including The Late Lament and the full orchestral intro) are hard for this listener to stomach.  I can point to any of the earlier music included here and say pretty much the same thing.  Whatever the reason, the original source material used for this CD could've seriously benefitted from earnest remastering work.  While I suspect that would've raised the asking price of 'Gold', I also would contend that great music DESERVES such caring treatment.    As it is, too much of 'Gold' as issued is indeed quite tarnished, which in the real world given the metal that goes by periodic symbol of Au would've been impossible to do.  But evidently in realm of the corporate music world, when selling music on the cheap and banging out sloppily compiled CDs it's very easy to take the most precious and thoroughly muck it up+music
"DAZED AND CONFUSED ABOUT THE ADVERTISING"+N+I was looking to get the DVD of DAZED AND CONFUSED but got the CD. When it was advertised on the AMAZON website it led me to believe that it was a DVD as you see it above. (1993 Film) I had to return it and my expense. Very disappointing transaction with AMAZON. Threfore, i am not impressed+music
Kind of a disappointment+N+Except for the song, Mother Mother, I didn't really care for the rest of the cd.  I bought it for Mother, Mother so I guess I got what I wanted.  I had hoped to like other songs as well, but, oh well+music
Very Disappionted+N+This CD was supposed to expose a new side of Dar Willams, it has failed to do this. The lyrics, and songs are repetitive of previous works. I would suggest buying something else+music
How stupid!+N+Stinkish-I totally agree with you 100%!!!! What was mattel thinking when they released this item? Some songs are ok, but "Hit me baby one more time?" That song is soooo old! And so yesterday, by lip singer, Hilary Duff, is sooooo yesterday!!!! You gotta be desperate for music to actually buy this or want it.If you think that i am way wrong then include me in your review+music
Chasm . . . Throw This Off A Cliff+N+Ryuichi Sakamoto's credibility is on the precipice with Chasm, a turgid unlistenable work of crud. Check out Coro and Only Love Can Conquer Hate, both sound like factory machinery at work. Dire, dreadful and diabolical. Stop being the artiste Ryuichi and have a go at entertaining. Your fans deserve better+music
YUKK!!!+N+She doesn't sing... SHE YELLS!!! And using one of Ednita's songs as she did with "Lo que son las cosas" is just sacrilege at its "best" (or worst). It's really easy to hit it big with your first single when the song is already a classic by itself. She has absolutely nothing on Beyonce or Cristina Aguilera. Her cd is just plain bad! If you want to hear good music by latin women with beautiful powerful voices (and that actually SING), you might want to look for La Lupe, Celia Cruz, Ednita Nazario and Lucecita Benitez... and these are only the ones I remembered at the moment+music
A true disappointment+N+Amazingly this compilation has managed to get together some of the most untallented performances of Brahms' music. With a few exceptions the moto of this CD can be summed up as 'no understanding and appreciation for a musical genius'. The choice of music is also quite perfunctory. There are many Brahms pieces that could have served better the bedtime purpose. Buy at your own risk. My only fear is that some people will get their first impressions of Brahms from this CD..+music
Too many birds+N+While the sound of the stream is relaxing and well recorded, there are way too many birds around. The CD describes their sound as distant and faint, but that's far from accurate. The parts of the CD where all you hear is the stream alone don't add up to more than 10 minutes, and never last more than a minute. For the most part you will hear the stream and plenty of birds, rather close and sometimes very loud.   Buyer beware: the 30 second samples you get here are precisely from the parts with no birds at all! Very misleading+music
Not even 1 star+N+I really think Snoop is a good rapper. He should only have stopped 10 years ago. I'm very tired of his gizzle wizzle nizzle stuff, and I don't like none of the beats here. And what's left then? nothing. I found out after i bought this album: I'm not a snoop fan anymore... Old School is the bes+music
A fantastic album and a monumental disappointment+P+I, like many others, have been waiting for this album for quite some time.  Right from the first track, I was hooked.  "All My Days" is a haunting, melodic, heartbreaking opening to a fantastic album.  "Breathe" has a subdued yet powerful message.  "Home" is just plain fun.  "Song For You" is sweet, somber, and hopeful.  However, I must say that the Four Songs version of "Orange Sky" is what I consider to be the greatest song ever written.  However, the Time Without Consequence version is devastatingly bad (when held up to the light of the original).  The new version is too fast, has an inexplicably irritating percussion, and just doesn't dig into the soul the way the Four Songs version does.  I will always be baffled by this remake.  It is truly awful.  Its only saving grace is that the original is still available.  But that is by no means any reason to avoid this CD.  In fact, those who do not know the original "Orange Sky" may fall in love with this one.  But it is my duty to warn those looking for an "Orange Sky" that matches the original that you will be severely disappointed.  Outside of this single-song complaint, this CD has vaulted to one of the best I own+music
Wonderful Christmas CD+P+Too many people are overwhelmed with the more modern Christmas songs out there today and are unaware of the wonderful music available on CDs like this.  John Rutter proves his brilliance in arranging and conducting.  The music overwhelms the senses and the joy of Christmas overcomes you as you listen.  This is one of the most peaceful Christmas CDs I have ever heard.  "Wassail Song" is incredible, and if you are ever in a small vocal ensemble, this song is a must to perform.  You will not be disappointed when you purchase this CD+music
Wrong titles for the songs+P+This is one of the ultimate collection's of pure music at its finest....1 problem thou...on the inside cd cover all the tracks have the wrong names...kinda crazy if u like to rip songs for your collection :(+music
One of the best+P+This era of Tangerine Dream (TD) was just great. The Virgin Years were truly a great period for TD. For me it deals with space and landscape. It's so close to repetitive music that would come much later. It's also the one group that used rythm to structure these flying melodies. You could fly with them and end up with more in the end. You can't say that for too many of these Electronic groups. After that period they would go on with this ambient music that wasn't up to the same standards. It seems they are back (with other musicians of course) with the same kind of concept. Great! They were an important link on the electronic scene. A great album! A great period+music
The Mother of All Film Scores...at Long Last!!!+P+This is a glorious recording of one of the most lyrical, haunting scores ever composed for a film. Each succeeding track is a treat for the ears, refreshing and invigorating. Neeley and Varese Sarabande should be congratulated for recording and releasing this hirtherto neglected gem.  In my opinion, though, the only part of the entire CD that doesn't work is the beginning of the "Waxworks" track - the score to this particular moment in the film (when Norma, watching herself onscreen, rises triumphantly to proclaim "I'll be up there again, so help me!") is one of the most powerful and recognizable images in filmdom. In the original, the music is strong, powerful and almost spine-tingling, but this moment on the CD is underwhelming and not fully realized. However, what is one misfire (totalling all of eight bars, at most) compared to the richness and texture of the rest of the recording?!  In short, if you love film music, you most likely love the score to SUNSET BOULEVARD - and if you love SUNSET BOULEVARD, then you will most likely love this recording, too+music
A fantastic listen for the open-minded fan+P+With Engines of Creation, Joe Satriani did what he has always done: make the most of the tools he chooses to use.   Only this time, he uses electronic beats and soundscapes as the canvas on which to express his skill with the guitar. It would be easy to give this one listen and wonder where the guy who wrote "Satch Boogie," "War" and "Flying in a Blue Dream" went.   Well, he's still here, only more than ever he's showing us his incredible command of his instrument by being able to create sounds that so perfecly reflect what they intend to convey.   I've never heard robots having sex, but I'm willing to be "Borg Sex" isn't far off. And although his calmly passing, sometimes noodling melodies appear to have little structure, that's kinda how you'd expect to see "Clouds Race Across the Sky." The 'chorus' to "Devil's Slide" sounds as sinister as its name suggests and "Attack" is as close to a musical sci-fi battle as I've ever heard.   To top it off, the album includes "Until We Say Goodbye," one of Satch's best ballads in his entire catalogue.  If you're willing to put a little more mental energy into appreciating the work Satch put into this album than just waiting for the album to rock your socks off Surfing With The Alien-style, you'll find that there's an incredible amount of depth -- and musicianship -- to be found.   It's not a Satriani masterpiece, but its a true testament to the man's enduring creativity+music
A Must for Feat Heads!+P+A grab bag of tasty goodies for all Feat fans. Several live tracks which never made it onto &quot;Waiting for Columbus&quot; and a deep well of out-takes, alternate versions and curios. Plus a hilarious explanation of  Lowell's bottleneck of choice (because you can go just about anywhere and  find one). If you love the Feat, you'll love this collection+music
Old Dude?+N+Do Ben Clark's teenage fans realize that he's pushing thirty?  The dude is OLD.  He's not a young jackass, he's an OLD jackass. And isn't it a bit creepy that an OLD dude like Ben tries so hard to appeal to 14-year-olds?  Check out the Lashes MySpace profile.  Creeeeepy!  +music
stands the test of time+P+I don't write reviews; my opinion is my own and it only matters to those who love me.  Still..."Amos Lee" stands the test of time.  How long ago did I buy this CD?  I played it to death when I got it.  Had to go see Amos when he came to town.  Talked my sister into going with me.  "You'll like him, he's low key, kind of jazzy-bluesy-folk music."  Recently popped the CD back into the CD player.  It's still soooo good for relaxing, slowing down, chillin'.  My daughter surprised me when the music started.  She said, "Is this Amos Lee?!! I love this CD."  And she's a 13 year old (self-described)orchestra nerd who loves modern hard rock:  emo.  If you haven't gotten this one yet, but you've been thinking about it, stop waiting.  It's intellingent, sophisticated, difficult to classify, and won't get old+music
Journey of a Gemini -- This CD is WONDERFUL !!!+P+This is my first Donell Jones' CD, and I can truly say this is by far perhaps the best CD I've heard in several years by any artist. The tracks from start to finish are great, and I found myself listening to the CD all day the first time I played it. What prompted me to buy the CD was the song I'm Gonna Be which I hear more on my satellite radio stations than I have locally here in Michigan. And because of the quality of music, I very rarely buy CD's anymore, however, after hearing I'm Gonna Be, I was telling a friend how much I liked that song and my friend happened to have the CD and only after listening to maybe 3 or 4 other tracks, I knew I wouldn't be disappointed.  I LOVE THIS CD - GREAT JOB, DONELL !!!  What I am disappointed in is the lack of promotion for this CD.  It just burns me up when there are some non-mainstream artists with a great product and for whatever (dumb) reason, the marketing depts. of the record companies that don't actively promote artists such as Donell Jones who have quality products.  There isn't even a video out, which in this day and age, an artist must have a video to further promote their product(s). So shame on JIVE RECORDS (and all the other record companies) who don't actively and aggressively promote CD's with the quality that this one exhibits.   I recommend this CD to anyone who can appreciate good quality R&B - both youngheads and oldheads (I'm an old head in my mid-40's).   I have been doing my own promotion for this CD and will contact my local radio stations to ask that they include I'M GONNA BE in their rotation.  +music
Garbage compared to &quot;Let's Get Free&quot;+N+Their first album &quot;Let's Get Free&quot; was a 5 star masterpiece, unfortunately this one is horrible.  There are only 2 good tracks on this album, both which are deep and reminiscent of &quot;Let's Get Free.&quot; One is &quot;Sellin D.O.P.E.&quot; and the other is &quot;Look Around&quot; which is already featured on Beatnuts' &quot;Musical Massacre,&quot; and to make things worse they chop off 3 minutes of the song.  The other tracks are boring and uninspiring.  They completely changed up their entire formula as if to impress the commercial heads who know nothing about real hip hop.  The beats are either recycled or &quot;snare- happy, throw them bows&quot; type beats that are for a whole different crowd of listeners then their first CD.  It's much like a book with no pages.  Shine with no substance.  It's too bad that with their first joint they dropped a gem on us and then with this one strayed away from their roots.  I'm optimistic that they will soon get back to the old Dead Prez formula that made &quot;Let's Get Free&quot; so great.  But until then, don't pick this one up+music
(2.5 Stars) Not Missing Much With This CD+N+Wu-Tang Clan has seen better times.  I remember a day when you couldn't help but love everything Wu put out either as a group or individually.  Remember the good ole days of Enter The Wu-Tang, Liquid Swords, Tical, Only Built For Cuban Linx, and Ironman?  Now years later, the outlook for any kind of renaissance is very slim.  Don't get me wrong, Ghostface Killah laid it down with his latest album Fishscale.  But Clifford Smith a.k.a. Method Man is a totally different story.  4:21...The Day After continues the slippery slope that his solo career has been traveling.  There are a few cuts that you might get into like the charismatic "Is It Me" or the posthumous verse of ODB on "Dirty Mef."  You can even accept songs such as the Lauryn Hill assisted "Say,"  the Erick Sermon produced "Gotta Have It," or even "Let's Ride" featuring Ginuwine as being decent.  One thing that's become obvious is the fact that he can't hold it down alone like he did with Tical.  But a bunch of these tracks are missing the entertainment quality that we've become accustom with from Method Man.  I mean, "Somebody Done F*cked Up" has some energy, but the beat is too repetitive and never switches up once.     The majority of 4:21...The Day After is brought down by perplexing production and mudane vocals from both Method and his guest artists.  Streetlife brings his wackness to songs like "4:20" and "Everything" (the latter also features an uninspiring verse from Inspectah Deck.)  And you would think putting Method, Rza, and Raekwon on a track would be a banger, but "Presidential M.C." comes and goes without much fanfare.  Other weak selections include "Konichiwa B*tches," "4Ever" featuring Megan Rochell, and "Fall Out."  I honestly can't see anybody rushing out to get 4:21....The Day After except to complete their Method Man collection.  This album won't get much pub from Def Jam and it seems Method Man is going through the motions at this day in his career.  Everyone had high hopes for Method Man's career...but it seems like the only high he'll be getting is with a blunt.+music
Isreal Symphomy Ochrester+N+Trash...trash...trash..the worst recording he has ever done..It would have been better if he recorded it with the Uganda Symphony Orchester. I wasted my money on this piecs of junk. And if possoble I'd like you to send this review directly to him+music
Johnny Ramone does NOt play electric heavy metal guitar!!+N+Frist of all this is  an okay album don't get me wrong, but I bought it because Johnny Ramone is supposed to be a great guitarist but he really isn't. Plus it kinda sounds like it was recorded with the band playing in a bathroom, with two tin cans on a string: one in the bathroom withthe band and the other running out to the hallway with a radio shack microphone sitting in front of it. Catchy tunes but if i had it to buy over again I'd probably just d/l essential tracks like I Can't Be and I Don't Wanna Be Learned/I Don't Wanna Be Tamed and spend my hard hustled scratch on a better produced Ramones album like End Of The Century or Pleasant Dreams+music
Oh so beautiful....there's nothing else like it+P+I can't explain how powerfully this album moves me. At first listen, I was disappointed. There was no "Night of the Swallow," no "Moving," or other rousing songs that make me want to dance, alone, in the night.  Then, I read someone's review which spoke of listening to this album in a dark room alone. I made time for this album. Time alone for me is scarce, but I missed Kate and made room for her. We cooked together, went on long walks, even went running once or twice. I fell in love with "Sunset" first. The flamenco guitars, the rhythm picking up, the multiple sky images. I listen to this and feel one with the sky. It is such a positive, beautiful album. Listening to it feels like a religious experience.  This is not party music. It's not for socializing either. I had a good friend over and I just wanted to tell her to stop talking so I could soak in this beautiful, beautiful music. Kate's voice is softer here. She wears her motherhood comfortably, and it shows, yet she still has that incredible vocal range.   I had thought that there was no surprises left in music for me. I was wrong. That doesn't mean I like all songs equally. I listen to the songs on the first disk (especially while running), but it's disk 2 that captured my heart. "Sunset," then "Nocturn." Then, sweet "Aerial:"  "I want to be up on the roof I've gotta be up on the roof Up, up high on the roof Up, up on the roof In the sun."  I am trying to say that this album is a visceral experience. You have to live it, immerse yourself in it, give yourself over to it.  For those of you disappointed with it, I recommend giving it another chance. Especially listen to it outside. I think you might yourself similarly entranced as I was.+music
Better then Trouble+P+I liked Trouble but I think this CD is a little better. I like the musical arrangements better  this time around. The addition of John Medeski and Chris Wood give the music a deeper more full sound. Trouble sounded mostly like Ray playing an acoustic guitar. Where Till the Sun Turns Black really has some excelent backing musicians. Lyrically I like both about the same. I say to get both discs they have alot to offer.+music
Listen to it and love it+P+Guys, if you've got feelings for Tim, you're gonna love this one. If you know anything about honest to God country music, this is what you look for. This guy is extremely good and his music fits+music
Dumb Franchize Boyz+N+Dem Franchize Boyz drifted around the ATL music scene and dropped a number of independent releases, but then their song "White Tee", while not necessarily becoming a major hit by Billboard standards, did give them some brief attention. But that's nothing compared to the popularity they've received thanks to their latest album, On Top of Our Game.  I personally don't see what the big deal is about this album. Before I listened to it, I thought I would be annoyed by all the snap music, but it turns out that the problem isn't necessarily the music itself, but the below-average lyrics that all four members of Dem Franchize Boyz put on wax. I never was that impressed by "I Think They Like Me" (an obvious single because it's censored), but the thing is, that's actually the best song on the album.  Many of the songs feature all-too-familiar subject matter, like cars ("Ridin' Rims"), bling-blingin' ("You Know What It Is"), and hardcore sex ("Freaky As She Wanna Be" -- and why does Trey Songz keep wasting his talent like this?). The choruses can get a little uncreative too: "Don't Play With Me" has "B, don't play with me" while "Stop Callin' Me" has "B, stop callin' me" (by the way, calling the latter song wack would be an understatement). And "They Don't Like That" makes me wonder if they were reading our minds.  The production also tends to get repetitive; when I heard "Suckas Come and Try Me", I felt like singing: "I think I think they like me!" And the remix of "White Tee" is unnecessary, especially because they mention their white tees in just about every song on here. I'm also starting to think my brother was right when he suggested that D4L and Dem Franchize Boyz are the same group.  The only thing more annoying than the group's rapping is when Damon Dash shows up on "Bricks 4 the High". No, he isn't rapping; he's instead talking -- no, not talking; WHINING about severed ties with Jay-Z and Roc-a-Fella (*sigh*...is he still talking about that?). In the end, while I wouldn't call this the worst So So Def album ever (Young, Fly & Flashy Vol. 1 gets that honor), it's pretty darn close. If this is Dem Franchize Boyz at the top of their game, what does rock bottom look like?  Anthony Ruper+music
Moneen is On This CD!+P+I have not heard this CD yet but...Moneen is on it and Moneen rocks my world. So check this CD out because Moneen is on it+music
Disappointing+N+..these 3 have worldwide status and have produced some amazing tracks so I can't understand why they put this out. The album lacks quality, imagination, energy, and inspiration. There isn't one G funk influnced track on the album but a lot of slow/mid tempo stuff. I've tried listening to this twice and managed skipping the whole CD in a short space of time. To you Gangsta listeners out there, don't waste your money....i ain't gonna go on any more about this album so if you don't believe me..buy it+music
If he is following Bright Eyes, he has a lot of maturing to do+N+First of all, this album mirrors Bright Eyes in so many ways, it's almost ridiculous. He sings about photographs, NBC, drinking. Bright Eyes song Old Soul Song is all about developing a photograph. Let's Not Sh** Ourselves has Conor yelling about NBC, ABC, and CBS (two of which An Angle has in Change The World) and Bright Eyes sings about drinking in about 1/4 of his songs. Also, Kris has mastered the Bright Eyes singing style. This is not a negative thing, it's just very similar.   But as for the album itself, minding the bright eyes comparision, it is about 3 miles away from a masterpiece. That being said, at least it's on the road to a masterpiece, albeit far far away. Songs like True Love and A Way With Words are fantastic and shine on the album. Songs like White Horses and Green Water have an strong energy and really keep you interested in what else Kris has to offer. But too many songs just leave the listener bored and asking "when is he going to stop singing about getting drunk?" Songs like Born in a Bottle and Angry Drunk are pretentiously long and lyrically boring. Going back to Bright Eyes, the only reason that songs like The Big Picture work is because the lyrics are so brilliant. Kris doesn't have this lyrical ability yet.   However, I am excited about the future of An Angle. I think in the next coming years if Kris can mature a little, both musically and lyrically, he'll make an album that's brilliant. An album like Bright Eyes' "I'm Wide Awake It's Morning" (which I believe is his best). Maybe he should just lay off the drinking.+music
You had to be there+N+ALL THE BEST SONGS ARE ON OTHER ALBUMS.  This is an audio recording from multi-media presentations.  Much of the material is geared around visuals and Anderson's stage personnae.  This is like listening to a television broadcast of a football game without the picture.  You get the general idea what is going on, but you miss a lot.  It is not like listening to a football game over the radio, where the broadcasters explain what you aren't seeing.  Without the visuals to go with this CD, many of the stories and jokes come up flat.    This CD set is about 4 and a half hours long.  It was taken from several years of Anderson's live shows that eventually became the United States.  Each CD more or less covers a specific "tour".  Her back up band changes from CD to CD.  You can tell that as time goes on, she gets more famous (and maybe has more money) she is able to add more to the shows (and her backup band gets bigger).  The sound quality is amazingly good.  It is sharp and crystal clear.  There is almost no audience noise, which does help create a good atmosphere for her stories.  About 80% of the material is spoken word.  There is some music.  It is probably less than 45 minutes of the total 4 and a half hour production.  The recordings come from early in her career.  She later redid most of the best material and put in on other albums.    I would suggest getting her other CD's.  Or if you want to see her performance art work, I would suggest searching out the Home Of the Brave VHS tape (I don't think it has been released on DVD).  Don't get the Home of the Brave CD+music
An alternative view+N+This came out when I was 12: it would have been far too 'difficult' an album for a young whippersnapper and I was only vaguely aware that the Bunnymen existed at that time. In my early teens I bought a few Bunnymen singles and Ocean Rain; now, 24 years later, I'm trying to fill in the rest of the Bunnymen jigsaw.   After a week of repeated listening, I'd say you can try on this album in either of two ways. Either, you judge it by its stand out songs, which are far and few between: if you can listen half a dozen times and manage to hum more than 2 tunes afterwards, you're doing better than me.   Alternatively, you can put it in context: appreciate that this was a pretty original approach at the time and marvel at the uncanny proto-U2 sound, (which I have to say does precious little to endear it to me). If you're interested in exploring music history largely for its own sake, it's worth hearing in order to understand how we got from Joy Division to U2 within a couple of years. However, if like me you think both Joy Division and U2 are vastly overated, this really isn't going to do much for you.   It's determindly bleak, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but this also captures the Bunnymen at a stage before they got a knack for melody: only 'Over the Wall' and 'A Promise' deliver a decent hook. I've seen Heaven Up Here described as a work of 'rare beauty'. It can also cause a tense, nervous headache.  If you're interested in the early 80's British underground scene, then of course you should hear it, along with the other Bunnymen albums. Compared to the lush Scott Walker-esque Ocean Rain, though, this is half-baked and less than half-rewarding.+music
The most overrated album in history!+N+Never a Beach Boys fan I had to listen to this much hyped album after hearing rave reviews. What a dissapointment. I just don't get it. &quot;God only knows&quot; is indeed a masterpiece, but the rest of the album is  filled with boring music that does nothing for me. I've tried multiple  listenings to make sure I'm not missing anything, but the plain truth is  that this album stinks. I was expecting some deep music as described by  some Beach Boys fans, but the best use I can get out of this album is using  it as a coaster. In a word, BORING+music
It's a joke+N+Very bad selection of songs, most of them you alredy have in others Bee Gees collections like number ones or the record.  It would be much better if the producers choice new songs like country lanes, or tears and remaster them.   Any real fan can make a better list+music
Scarling surpasses Jack Off Jill+P+This proves that Scarling is an original and creative band, far surpassing Jack Off Jill. All JOJ fans can be sure, that Scarling is no JOJ reborn, but is it's own band, inovative and brain-tickling. What a refreshing break from the norm! ~Mirlin Popla+music
Now wait one minute !+P+Now, I know I'm not the only one that realizes that critics barely know what the hell their talking about. I must admit that the first time I heard this album I was not that thrilled by it. But the more I heard it, it quickly became one of my favorites. I think this album is very underated and quite brilliant. I believe that this album allowed Prince to develope as an artist in a big way.+music
Great!+P+Simply put, this is a classic. The album is basically perfect and not one of the tracks are 'fast-forward-able'. Black Thought gets better with each release and the band seems to get tighter and tighter with their chemistry and sound. The guest appearances are great too. This is the album that clearly defined them as the pioneers they are+music
Super Happy Funky & Energizing!!!+P+Every time I listen to this album, I have to jump up and down!!!  Lot's of fast tempo beats and super fun lyrics!  I highly recommend it+music
Unbelievable+P+First off to avoid any conflict of interest claims I admit that I an a huge Rod Stewart fan. That being said, I just wasn't interested in hearing him do the old American classics(which I also love). I just didn't see how he could do them justice, that is, until I saw his DVD "Live from Royal Albert Hall" in which he did several of the songs from his first "Great American Songbook". I was just blown away. These songs were now his. I went to the computer to order one of the CDs but my wife talked me into getting all three and I am surely not sorry. I believe that there are very few CDs available with no weak tracks(there are some) but here are three that just don't have a weak track(IMHO). He has made all of these great songs his. My all time favorite song is "Stardust" by Hoagy Carmichael. I had never heard a version that I thought could top his, until now. If you love the old standards you should really give these 3 CDs a listen. They'll melt your heart!!!+music
What's become of the Great American Songbook?+N+This is a collection of the cream of the cream of the Great American Songbook by a rock'n'roll singer who contributes nothing at all to American culture. This rate #1 is to express my deep deception about the successful album series.  Over exposed material which has been treated so many different ways by so many different vocalists with artistry should be treated respectfully.  I am not a dictator but I would vote for a Law that would impose respect for some art expressions which represents the treasure of American culture.  More than that, the series success reflects lack of understanding of the music context by people who should search for entertainment in a more valid and truer way.  That's the deal: there is truth missing, there is a sensation of a money-make production. Mellow and arrangements, neglectable performances, lacking creativeness. To be completely forgotten some years ahead.+music
Lots of dusty folk songs about a hard life they love--Live+P+Disc 1.  Buskers who have been together long enough to tighten up, play inside each others' moves, and develop a distinctive style all their own-dusty folk songs about a hard life they love.  Subdudes come to mind.  They document life on the road, in a beloved Australia, and their personal lives in up-close personal terms.  Striking phrases of lyrics repeatedly grab my attention. They fans love them and they love entertaining them.  Disc 1 is a revelation.  [72:04]  Disc 2 offers more of the same.  Maybe too much of a good thing all at once-the distinctive style gets a little claustrophobic.  And yet, I want to hear more.  Watch for last track.  [68:15] +music
Puts the Dead back in Dead Prez+N+This is typical political hip hop. Rants, slander, and completely moronic and asinine conspiracy theories. All accompanied by weak beats, bad lyrics, and terrible performances by M(oron)-1. This political rap garbage needs to die out and it makes me happy to know this junk flopped. Save your money and buy Ghostface's new album. This will be surely headed to my list of the year's worst albums. Big Big Big Big Thumbs down+music
yuck+N+Sounds like every other I'm such a sensitive sad male garbage that is flooding corporate radio stations. Boo hoo.  The bravado of these people to take a beautiful song (all is full of love) and puke on it.  It really makes me sick to my stomach+music
Lil Jon - Lil Talent+N+Okay let me get this straight.  If I wear dreadlocks, throwback sports apparel, big sunglasses, put some radiators in my mouth, act drunk, and scream lame unintelligible raps I too can be a big star?  Alas, there is no accounting for taste or the lack thereof.  Scuse me whilst I look for a bridge to leap from+music
bonus DVD is a DUD+N+I grew up listening to Bob Dylan, and was really looking foward to his his new DVD, Modern Times, and was really disgusted when i tried the bonus DVD in two dvd players i have,and lent it to a friend to try,and neither one of us could get it to play.I should have returned it,but after my friend tried and failed to get it to play,as stated,i was just disgusted. I desided not to order any more music DVDs from Amazon.I must say that the  music on the first DVD was great,starting with Thunder On The Mountain,it was good to listen to some new Dylan.+music
Brave New World+P+Laurie Anderson recently applied for and was hired as kitchen worker at McDonald's hamburger joint near her studio in Manhattan. Huh???...yes it's true, and she recounts her McDonalds experience in her new performance piece, "Happiness". Laurie Anderson can find beauty in strange places. At Town Hall, eight short days after the collapse of the Trade Towers, Laurie found beauty in a terrifying place. She performed "Love Amoung the Sailors", from her Bright Red album and the lyric..."There is no pure land now, no safe place...If this is the work of an angry God, I want to look in his angry face..." ; becomes a prophetic statement of iron willed resolve. "Let X=X" takes on a new meaning as we, the listeners, are placed in an aisle seat of a burning plane.  George Bush talked about "wanted dead or alive" and "hunting down terrorists like dogs" and Laurie Anderson talked about the phenomena of flaming birds in the sky after the American planes became guided missles from hell. Now, one year later as Sadam becomes the ghost of Osama, I look to Laurie Anderson's concert at Town Hall as a defining moment in a Brave, New World. Laurie Anderson (not Rudy Guliani) is New York's first citizen and the heart and soul of this planet, Earth+music
Prince Serves Notice To The World On This Seminal 80's LP!!+P+Man, what can I say about this album but CLASSIC!!  Prince was 23 when he dropped this one and forever served notice to the world that he was a different  kind of kat and that the whole scape of the pop world as  we had known it at that time was going in HIS direction!  Never one to conform or confine himself to any one  particular musical genre, he delves into new wave & punk  (Dirty Mind, When You Were Mine), then grooves us with the nasty but infectious "Do It All Night"... Then he goes into the album's only slow jam, the lamenting "Gotta Broken Heart Again", which is a classic to true Prince fans who go all the way back with him!  Then Side 2 opens with the punk-funky "Uptown",  which truly captures the vibe of the times of pre-aids, experimental, ambisexual, free-lovin'  late 70's / early 80's america!-- Which is the world that I came of age in!  (I was 16 when this album came out and it  seemed that Prince was reading my mind!)  Then at the end of "Uptown" there's a cool  synthesizer effect that swooshes us right into  the classic gut-bucket synth funk of "Head",  which is self- explanatory!  Then, at the end of that, the same synth swoosh  takes us into Prince's tabu tale of incest as a streetkid  of 16 who lives (albeit antagonistically!) with a half sister of 32 who is determined to teach  him her warped view of the facts of life or else  "Put him on the street again!"-- A punked-out, rockin', fast-moving piece  that caused quite a stir back then! Then the synth swoosh takes us to one of my  all-time fave Prince "Party Til' You Pass Out!" jams.... "Party Up"!! This song sends this classic album out with a bang!  The "Dirty Mind Tour" of late '80 and early '81 was  quite a spectacle to behold! Prince broke all the  taboos of sexuality, fashion, staging and just brought  a whole new energy to the game that just caught  you on fire!  He was the opening act (at that time!)  for then "supposedly" notorious Rick James (RIP),  whose "Fire It Up" tour was all the rage!  But to those of us who were lucky enough to see it,  it soon became apparent that Prince's flame  made poor Rick's look like a bic lighter! After about 3 months of what was supposed to be  a 6 month tour as Rick's opening act,  tired of being upstaged, Rick James fired Prince from  the  tour and harbored a bitter resentment of him which  lasted up until about a year before his death in 2004  when he had to finally acknowledge that Prince Rogers Nelson was indeed a true genius and a force of nature!   If you don't have this album in your collection,  you're short-changed 4-real!+music
I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself either+P+Excellent, excellent, excellent!  I love this raw sound of the White Stripes that doesn't sacrifice the melody.  Jack shows he is one of the best rockers out there (and Meg, well, you gotta love Meg!).  Standout tracks are Seven Nation Army (which sounds like Salvation Army), Ball and Biscuit (I love to crank up the solos!), I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself, You've Got Her In Your Pocket, and even In The Cold, Cold Heart (You go Meg!).  Yes, the drums are choppy in places, but it works well with the White Stripes and you gotta admit - there is no one else like them.  They are original and are here to stay+music

disappointed+N+I bought this CD based on the reviews for my 2 yr. old. Some songs are okay but the lyrics on some of the others do not make much sense. My daughter was scared by the way a few songs turn from a soft tone to a loud shout by the end of the song. ("There's a Little Wheel A-Turnin In My Heart" and "Pig on Her Head"). I really didn't like "I'm a Mess" which sounds like a heavy-rock/rap and also scared my daughter. I would recommend instead Karyn Henley's CDs which I found to be the best out there for the toddler age group (3-5 yrs). She tells stories between some of the songs which really engages my daughter. The songs are wholesome and innocent+music
Way Overrated+N+Out of this whole CD, I could only pick about 3 songs that I liked.  This CD is very disappointing and some of the songs were down right annoying.  The best songs on here are Everything Part I, II/ Bow Before The King and Victory.  Past those songs, there is not much because I can't bear to listen to the rest. Those two songs get 1 star each+music
fun, but not appropriate for kids - violent lyrics+N+This CD is fun and musically intriguing, but not appropriate for kids... one song talks about "what can you do in a case like that but stamp on your mother, and your toothbrush, and on everything that's helpless." Another talks of being an immigrant to the country and says "and they beat me, and they banged me, and they left me on the ground." And another says "I'm a great sharpshootress. There is nothing that I can't shoot in the eyes, or the ears, or the teeth, or the fingers." Musically it's fun and goofy and intriguing, but I was appalled when I realized what I was encouraging my young child to listen to. +music
Should have changed name, simple as that.+N+This band claiming to be hopesfall is not! There is only one original member left, they should of changed their name with the release of atypes, no question. Atypes is a disgrace to the people who grew up with hopesfall in NC! I would have respected them if they changed their band name+music
An ode to the 90's+N+How can a group fall as far as they did?  "Who Can You Trust" and "Big Calm" were both classics (dispite the fact that they sounded totally different from one another).  Now with "FoF" it just went down hill...and never came back+music
I wanted so badly to like this.+N+I really couldn't wait to get this CD.  I wanted so badly to like it.  But - it is just too bluegrassy for me.  Every single song.  It would be great one or two songs, but every song gets old.  Plus, the recording quality doesn't seem that great.  You can barely hear the words, and most kids want to sing along.  Jenny Jenkins is a fun song, and Shenendoah is hauntingly beautiful, but For the Kids and NO! are way better CD's+music
Innovative musical hybrid+P+This CD re-release of their 1981 album has been substantially enhanced by the addition of many previously unreleased tracks. It opens with their masterpiece Wheel Me Out, an eerie and evocative piece with addictive beats and strange interpolations by vocalist Liz Weiss.   The hit title track is a funky rap, Where Did You Heart Go? a mellow soulful ballad with great sax and Tell Me That I'm Dreaming a complex piece with many samples and unusual vocal arrangements.  Oh Mr Friction has a jerky rhythm, meandering saxophones and rap-style vocals, whilst Carry Me Back To Old Morocco has an innovative instrumental mix and fun lyrics, reminiscent of their James Brown song. It's An Attack with its delicious sax patterns is closer to a rock song but with a jazzy edge, whilst The Sky's Ablaze is a spoken poem with minimal instrumentation.   The additional tracks provide a wider perspective on the virtuosity of this unique band whose music remains hard to categorize.  My favorites are Christmas Time In Motor City and the dub version of the title track.   The list of vocalists and instrumentalists on this innovative album is quite phenomenal. Was (Not Was) certainly contributed to making the early 1980s a very interesting period in popular music.+music
This Is One Common Project that Made Absolutely No Sense       +N+I am a Common fan. I have all of his projects and go out of my way to get all the music that he is featured on or artists that he aligns himself with personally. If he's on it or likes it, its alright at the very least. Or at least thatw what I thought.  This Album was indeed eccentric to say the very least. Unfortunately, what many do not realize, is that just because it is different does not make it good. This album is not good. The same socially conscious message is there for the most part and that is the only reason I dont give it a one. The Production overall is horrible and though the message is the same, the lyrics are not quite as sharp. His worst effort clearly.  Some cat on this page said that it is better than Can I Borrow A Dollar and One Day It'll All Make Sense........he's on some extremely potent narcotic drug to say that. He cannot beleive that himself. That is the most single ridiculous critique of a solid Hip Hop album that I have ever heard. Nothing personal, but I by no means agree with him and neither would any other head who has heard either of the albums. He's CRAZY!!+music
Favorite DCFC album+P+When you listen to a cd, why do you listen to it? Simply because it sounds cool, or you enjoy how it relaxes you, or it fits a certain atmosphere? If that's how you listen to cd's, don't bother getting this album. I wouldn't want you to. This album is best enjoyed by those who listen to something because they get the feeling inside of it. I don't know why so many people here call this album pop and lighthearted. I completely disagree. The lyrics are not particularly dark, as opposed to maybe, lyrics from Alice in Chains' "Dirt", but they aren't exactly happy either. I absolutely love them. "Sleep Spent" is a great song. There is a lot more to this album than everyone seems to let on. The key to DCFC's music is that it takes a lot of listening before you actually get it, and the emotional value begins to sink in. I have been listening for three years, and just in the last six months or so, has the meaning of their music, the emotion behind it, the depression, sadness, and confusion finally begin to show themselves through the tone of Ben's voice and the guitar riffs. I'm not suggesting this is a depressing album, in fact it's rather comforting. Most of their albums are.+music
the new rubbish+N+its a good thing i downloaded this for free. because aint no way in hell i'd buy it+music
self-referential bs, and not of the good kind+N+I've probably listened to "crane wife" several dozen times (one of the perks of working for a hipster clothing retailer) and after rolling meloy's lyrics around in my head for a month or so i can honestly say that he has created the pirate-prog rock song cycle of the year, which somehow is not as cool as you'd think it might be. what i really don't understand is the slavering fanboyism this band seems to inspire within some "intellectual" music fan circles. just because you need to use a dictionary to decpiher meloy's overblown dickensian narratives doesn't make them well-written or intelligent. instead "the crane wife" is the newest addition to the recycled 18th Century story sketches meloy doesn't seem to be able to depart from. maybe i'm just too picky but lyrics such as "Produced my pistol, then my saber to make no whistle or thou will be murdered" from "the island" come off as extremely silly, especially when filtered through meloy's extremely nasal delivery. the "crane wife" titled-tracks produce some interesting images, but ultimately lose their effectiveness due to meloy's weakness for 10-dollar-words. overall, the whole album sinks under the weight over over-writting, over-singing, and over-playing. meloy and co. should put down the dickens for a little while and read some william carlos williams.    +music
Very disappointing+N+I was extremely disappointed by this album. It just didn't grab me at all like Fallen did. It has no outstanding tracks or anything much memorable. I guess Nightwish has spoiled me. Before, Evanescence was about the only female-fronted band I cared to listen to. Now that I have discovered Nightwish, Evanescence just seems useless. Sorry, but I just don't care for it+music
Stay away from this album+N+I put one star because it's the minimum, if not, I would've gave it zero stars. This CD can be reviewed in so few words... here are some: NO!!! Don't Bad Stay Away from it I told you, NO!!!  In short, no music from the movie is here, and the music that is here... well, it might as well not be here, and it would it be better that way.   Summary: NO!!! don't get this CD, use the money in something else, get a hamburger or somethin+music
HELP ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!+N+When brian goes to his first race in the eclipse there is a song that starts "tell me whats the secret im missing and im...." i would really appreciate it if someone could tell me the name of the song and the artist. Thanks.+music
"HISTORY IN THE MAKING"+P+If I were to rate the packaging, I would have to agree with the reviewer who complained about the way it was made, I've had the discs fall out several times myself.  But it's a beautifully packaged and recorded document(in its appearance and sound) that I listen to constantly.  One problem I have when I look at the roster of talent, is I'm reminded or our own mortality; so many of these people are now dead, and the era that followed can never replace what was here. That could be good, though, they all sound so alive here, enhanced by one of the best bands ever to grace a stage.  As an aside, I wonder why people call a death  "passing away," or just "passing." They didn't "pass," they died; there's no shame in saying it. Richard Manuel, Rick Danko, Paul Butterfield, Muddy Waters, Carl Radle, and Pop Staples are all dead; go ahead, say it. I don't think they'll mind. Nobody flinches at the word "suicide" when talking about Richard Manuel, but let Rick Danko peacefully drift off in his sleep, and he "passes away." These things have always puzzled me.  Back to the music; it's all good, so much talent crossed that stage that night, the audience had a real treat. The Band's songs cover such a wide spectrum of topics, and I understand the guys resenting Robertson's appropriation of the writing credits, but these are men who have definitely walked the walk, and because of that, they are certainly able to talk the talk. You can hear the heartbreak in Rick Danko's delivery of "It Makes No Difference," and the effects of the hard life in Richard Manuel's voice in "The Shape I'm In," and even more so in "Acadian Driftwood." His voice here is hoarse and ragged and PERFECT. Levon Helm summed up Manuel's demons quite well in in The Band's "Authorized Biography," and in his book, "This Wheel's On Fire." He said "That's between him and his Higher Power, and I've always tried to keep from having too much of an opinion about it." He is still shaken over it this many years later, you can see it in the video, because here, he just clams up, takes a big drag on his cigarette, and looks off somewhere into the distance. I can see in him a sense of betrayal by one of his closest friends, and the knowledge that it will always hurt.  This is relevant to "The Last Waltz," because there was a sense of brotherhood with these guys, from the beginning, all the way through, until huge success started to splinter that element. They were so good, and to watch this, knowing that these five will never grace a stage or studio in this form again, has the feeling of ending, of winding down, and being forced to say goodbye when you don't want to say goodbye.  Even though the sequencing is out of order, and there were a few omissions from the show, it's still a magnificent document of one of the greatest live performances of the era, one of the best+music
the fall of the beastie boys!+N+this ablum mad me loose a lot of respect for this band. dont bull this . get some of there earlier stuff+music
waited too long to get it+P+i didnt have the most remote idea that i was going to like this album this much. My only experience from the band was Clint Eastwood and recently Feel Good, which even though i thought it was great i wasnt too crazy about it.But i recently watched the whole Demon Days album played at the Manchester Opera House and...oh man! i was totally blown away! the performance waas amazing, i totally loved the songs, and all the energy that is coming from that stage makes you get up on your feet and start singing too. God! i wish i could have been there!i had to buy  the cd, love kids with guns, dirty harry, last living souls. Even the soft and mellow songs are amazing. I was talking to a friend when i started watching the DVD and i had to put the phone down.if you like something different, away from the ordinary, catch Damon albarn this time+music
like wow man+P+When I think of Greg Dulli, I think, why isn't this guy in more cigarette commercials? Also people have told me that I look like him, so I always want to check out with my doppelganger is up to. In the 1990s, Greg Dulli carried the weight called the Afghan Whigs and challenged everyone's attention largely on the force of his personality. That is so me. Outside of Kurt Cobain, Dulli is the only real charmer from ten years ago. His music was honest and cool and had R&amp;B and Motown sophistication. Dulli now peeps his head over the fence with Blackberry Belle. Dulli pissed his territory with songs about love and suicide in a style of a smooth operator. His voice is more confident than ever.  His new outfit seems more musical than the Afghan Whigs which were limited to their usual rock and rock paths. This is like when Nick Cave left the Birthday party to do much more stylish music on a bigger scope. I think Barry Adamson and Kid Congo are available for employment. I look forward to more records and shows+music
Good job Bebe and Joel... sorry, Ann.+N+A not bad recording of this, in my view, poor and rather over-rated show. Amazing orchestration and the performances of Bebe Neuwirth and Joel Grey stop this recording from falling in the gutter of musical tattle. The cast is nothing to get excited about quite frankly, although Bebe Neuwirth is a real treat as Velma. I wish the same could be said about her co-star.     Reinking, with her voice similar to the noise of clattering shovels, manages to (allbeit in the "Broadway-darling" style we have grown accustomed to) take awfulness to great new heights. The only thing that is good about her performance, quite frankly, is when it stops... reminiscent of that blissful moment when people stop playing bagpipes. Having said this, her acting is great, giving the character of Roxie depth and meaning - however ancient she portrays her. This is something Gwen Verdon tried and failed at. On balance though, Reinking's badness outweighs anything else, sadly.      Neuwirth with her "older" style of voice and singing makes her seem to own the role of Velma Kelly here, although she does over-do the older-portrayal sometimes.       Joel Grey lights up this recording with a superb performance and with much ease. On the whole, this isn't the best recording if this show I've heard, but its certainly not the worst.  A good buy if you know the show well, but, apart from that, steer clear for now.   +music

Three Cheers for Artistic Bravery+P+I grew up in the 80's, during the heyday of great dramatic metal bands like Iron Maiden and Queensryche. Now that I'm older (and a professional musician myself with years of classical training), I can recognize the cheesiness of the bands that I loved when I was a kid. But I can still listen to a lot of that material and appreciate the musical and poetic ambition, the theatricality and the grandeur that the bands of that day were earnestly striving toward.  I got "Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge" for free, and I probably wouldn't have even given it a listen if I hadn't been so intrigued by the cover art (which it turns out was done by the lead singer of My Chemical Romance). I'm embarrassed to say that I just associated this band with legions of mindless teeny-bopper fans and I couldn't even imagine liking their music. In retrospect, I see that that is an insult to the band and to its fans (who are clearly on to something).   It's been a long time since I've been excited about a rock band. The last five or six years have been discouraging ones for mature pop music fans. Maybe it's just me, but it seems like, in the wake of September 11th, 2001, we've been awash in nostalgia acts: The Strokes, The White Stripes, The Killers, The Scissor Sisters, Jet, Gnarls Barkley, Franz Ferdinand and the like. These are acts that deliberately attempt to evoke another era, not only with the sound and composition of their music, but also by the way they dress and even by their bands' names. It's true that pop music has always mined the past for inspiration, but these "retro-parody" acts, as I call them, shamelessly attempt to recreate a specific musical sound of an earlier time without bringing any stylistic innovation to the artistic process; the music could easily be mistaken for material recorded 20 or 30 years ago. And while I actually like some of the work being produced by these bands, I feel that this approach represents the worst kind of artistic cowardice, for it allows the artist to hide behind a veneer of irony. Like foam trucker hats, this kind of art mocks the style while copping the style at the same time. The artists puts nothing of himself into the art, and therefore risks nothing. In a day and age when real life seems dark and complicated, it's easy to understand the appeal of retro-parody music; it transports us to an imaginary time when life was simple, even simplistic, and when nonsensical music reflected that simple-minded aesthetic.  The more I listen to "Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge", the more I admire the sheer audacity of this record. The first time through, I couldn't shut it off; the album is a RELENTLESS attack of high-energy pop/punk, replete with rhythmic drive, wailing guitars, infectious hooks and lots of screaming. Even so, I thought the album might be a bit much for me- a little over the top, a little too dramatic. But I was intrigued by the lyrics, which seemed to be trying to tell a story, so I went online and poked around and found out that "Three Cheers" is in fact a concept album that tells the story of a man who must kill 1,000 evil souls in order to be reunited with his lover. I also found an interview with the band where they explained that they intended "Three Cheers" to be completely dramatic, theatrical and totally over-the-top; I'd say they succeeded on all three counts.   I realized that My Chemical Romance is a kind of anomaly in today's pop music sphere. They represent the rare breed of artist who is willing to take a huge risk for the sake of making an original artistic statement. No one out there is doing anything remotely like this; while MCR might sound stylistically similar to other bands out there, I think it's pretty safe to say that this is the only band making big, dramatic, SINCERE concept albums (in the line of "Operation:Mindcrime" and "Seventh Son of a Seventh Son"). I emphasize the word "sincere" because I think it's hugely important to the MCR phenomenon. While retro-parody acts mimic and mock the style and dress of 70's and 80's bands for a cheap thrill and a quick buck, My Chemical Romance clearly recognize that the great music of those decades was written with sincere intentions, and this is manifest in MCR's own music, which reflects the influence of their predecessors without ever sounding quite like any of them (you'd never mistake My Chemical Romance for an 80's or even a 90's band).   The fact that My Chemical Romance is hugely popular among people half my age (I'm in my early 30's) almost turned me off to the band. But I'm starting to realize that this kind of musical snobbery is self-defeating, and when it comes to pop music it may be that teenagers are sometimes more likely to recognize a good thing. Pop music critics, most of whom are my age or older, naturally fawn over the retro-parody acts, as these bands validate, by obsequious imitation, the music of the critics' own youth. But while the critics live in the past, I'm not surprised that MCR, whose lyrics sincerely and directly reflect the moral ambiguities of our own troubled times, have found many loyal young fans.  When you think about what this band is attempting on "Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge", it's actually pretty amazing that they pull it off. It would have been less surprising to see a band with this kind of grand artistic ambition simply fall flat, getting bogged down in solipsistic lyrics and ornate, melancholy music. But that doesn't happen here, because these guys have the talent, the wit, and the chops to make it happen.   The music, in fact, is probably the most surprising thing happening here. Forgetting for a moment the concept, the hype, the theatricality and all the rest, no one can dispute the fact that there is a high degree of musical talent at work on this album. Sure, the songs are basically formulaic- most good pop music is. But the songwriting is solid, accomplished and unique. The single "Im Not Okay", for instance, with its carefully-plotted and infectious vocal line, could almost have been ghost-written by a professional songwriter; but the quirky lyrics mark it as unmistakably original, an irresistable anthem for a new generation . It's easy to lose sight of MCR's strong compositional skill under all the screaming and the eyeliner, etc., but, to me, that makes it all the more admirable- the fact that the musical artistry of this band is never thrust in your face as something to be admired; it's just quietly at work, the motor driving this mad machine.   Not only are the songs remarkably well-crafted, but the execution of the songs is impressive, too. The sound of the band is incredibly tight, with dual guitars dominating the music texture. The lead singer does a lot of screaming, but also a lot of really excellent singing. He has a semi-obnoxious, but clear and strident voice, and a pretty wide vocal range. Forceful and propulsive, the album is pretty much a shot of musical adrenaline from start to finish, with a short interlude (track #8) that works to break up the texture a little bit. The only thing that prevented me from giving this album a full five-star review is the fact that tracks #11 & #12 tend to lag a bit, not in musical energy, but simply in content; they seem somehow like slightly meandering, B-level songs that might've been cut if the album were longer. But track #13 brings the record to a satisfying conclusion.   My Chemical Romance is a genuinely talented, skilled and honest band making an all-out attempt to deliver bold, artistic statements with each album; for this, I think they should be commended. Whether or not you like their music is entirely up to you, and I don't think a distaste for this type of adventurous stuff necessarily reflects badly upon the individual listener- just give MCR props for being artistically courageous+music
A REALLY REALLY!!! good album+P+I'd first heard of Lupe Fiasco on a track off of Kanye West's album "Late Registration" called "Touch The Sky" i said to myself man this guys good. As 2006 rolls around I kept hearing his first single "Kick,Push" on the radio I knew I had to get this cd when it came out. When I opened it and first played it in my truck OH MAN it was like opening your first present on christmas day. I couldn't stop playing it from "Real" to "The Emporer's Soundtrack" and the track that makes you think of the special girl in your life "Daydreamin" featuring Jill Scott, this is album you should DEFIANTLY add to your collection.  +music
Let me hear that again.+P+This is generally regarded as Public Enemy's best album.  It's easy to see why, because it does feature many of their best songs.  Like "Bring the Noise", "Don't Believe the Hype" and "She Watch Channel Zero".  Believe the hype+music
You eatin off hip hop and I hope you choke onthe gimmick!!!!!!!!+N+When are we gonna start boycotting this bubble gum pop bull S%%T! Lil john is one of the worst emtertainers on this earth. His flow is rough and terrible and he wastes beats on a regular basis. I guess all of the zombies and sheep won't appreciate me dissing this retarded muppet but someone has to stand up and say something. This album is a just like a vicious string of herpes infecting the youth of many nations. We need some hip hop penicillin like KRS ONE, Mos Def, and kwel+music
An Open Book+P+Loreena McKennitt's music will evoke other artists such as Enya and Kate Bush (when she's in full Celtic mode).  McKennitt seems a bit more earnest in her seeker stance, and there's nothing wrong with that.  It does probably mean that she may not reach everyone, especially those listeners who are less of a mystical bent.  There is precious little irony or skepticism here, so it pretty much helps to be on the same spiritual page as the artist herself.  Or at least to be able to temporarily to suspend your lack of belief.  I did after a few listens, and I found myself coming back for more.  New Age Music has its own kind of "hooks," and it is unlikely that once having heard the exotic arrangements here that you will be able to get them out of your head very easily.  Her European hit "The Mummer's Dance" is particularly haunting.   Unlike some of the reviewers below, I have to recommend this album with a few caveats.  It may be hard for fans to realize that this really WON'T be everyone's cup of herbal tea.  But then what is?  Although I can think of one or two people I wouldn't bother playing this for, if you like your music Romantic (in the original sense of the word) and your lyrics appropriately diaphonous, well, you can't do better than Loreena McKennitt. +music
Stop trying so hard+N+Brandon Cruz is trying to recapture something he never had. His credibility as an artist. Why else would he redo the songs written by Kyle instead of writing his own? Kyle toucher was the backbone of Dr. Know! I am utterly amazed at how Brandon can take truly amazing songs and butcher them beyond recognition.I recommend &quot;The Best of Dr. Know&quot; if you want to hear these songs as they were intended+music
Forever tacky?+N+Contrary to the concert of praise surrounding Lang's virtuosity, these memories have little to do with music. Is fingerbreaking pace, music? The scherzo of Chopin third sonata says it all: it's all about how fast Lang can play, not at all about what Chopin's music means. The score -written by the decidely stubborn Chopin- doesn't acknowledge Lang's change of tempo: there is no such thing as the slow part in the middle. Once again this music shows how well out of his depth this virtuoso is and how much hype, marketing and fashion of the day are propping these automats. I'll take the impetuous Argerich over this anytime: at least she is genuine. Her scherzo is organic, fluid. A recent CD by pianist Svetlana Ponomareva displays similar qualities and although in the obscurity as much as Lang is in the sun, she follows Chopin's score in a meaningful and sensitive way. Check the soundclip on her website [...], compare with others on amazon, listen! +music
The True King Of The South!+P+Lil Wayne has truly developed and grown over the years and this cd is only a taste of what's to come.Lil Wayne is one of the best rappers in the industry right now.He's the best rapper out the south(behind Mac)!He has a unique flow and some really diverse lyricism.Tha Carter 2 is a instant classic and it was the best release of 2005 in the Hip-Hop/Rap category!Lil Wayne is on top of his game,as he released 5 solo albums,3 group albums,most recently a duo album with Baby and has a numerous amount of mixtapes.If you haven't cop this cd yet,then you are truly missing out on a great classic!Keep bringing that fiya music Weezy F Baby+music
Definitely a buy!!!+P+One of 2005's odd gems, this is one of my favorite new bands. I can't really explain this album, just know that it is very strange and beautiful+music
seventy-one long minutes+N+"Raw?"  "Energetic"?  "In your face"? I honstly can't understand how anybody could think the stuff on ISM is any of those things. Energy level is close to that of "The Trinity Sessions", but this band doesn't have the self-discipline - or the vocal & instrumental skills, for that matter - of the Cowboy Junkies, so they go on & on & on & on & on ... meandering dweebishly forever.   Capsule description - high-pitched personality-free vocals that are not IMHO improved by the very free application of reverberberberb, against a background of lethargic mush. Coming soon to garage sales all over the country+music
4 stars+P+Outkast has always been an unbelievably creative and experimental group. Arising from the south, which is typically plagued with no-talent wannabe-emcees who can't seem to keep their platinum teeth off each other's rectum, they manage to always provide conventional and beautiful music. Their dope debut Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik was just a mere introduction to their skills, and would only pave the way for their untouchable classic known as ATLiens. On this superb sophomore LP, Outkast gave us an unbelievable grouping of introspective and thought-provoking music, with their own P-Funkish beats. Their experimentation only continued on their third album Aquemeni, which is yet another superb album. On this one, Big Boi and Andre 3000 experiment with some new sounds, go for some new creative subject matter, and slow down the tempo on a few notes. Their most recent album, 2000's Stankonia, showed how dynamic they were, giving us a mix of unbelievable, up-tempo party jams, feel-good music, and of course, the signature introspection. 2003 promised Outkast's return, and they indeed delivered.   Firstly, Speakerboxx/The Love Below are two albums packaged as one. Speakerboxx is Big Boi's album, and The Love Below is Andre 3000's solo effort. Each member of Outkast basically star on each album and provide their own musical landscapes and styles. They each released a single, one per album, hence making this feel as if it is two different albums, and in fact it is. Therefore, for my review, i will review it as two separate albums, to keep the comparisons separate throughout the majority of the review until my conclusion. Keep in mind as you read the review, before i begin, that both albums are VERY DIFFERENT, and i will review this with an open mind and as a true fan of Outkast, which i am... enjoy...    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Firstly, i will review Big Boi's album Speakerboxx. Big Boi's disk is loaded with the typical Outkast sound, keeping the experimentation level on a minimum. Big Boi has always been a dope lyricist, so i look forward to listening to this album with high hopes that he hasn't fallen off. The guest list looks pretty impressive, including some big mainstream names, and a couple of lesser known names. Still, Big Boi is the star, and he has proven in the past that he can carry the mantle. Let's hope that the same applies here.     Track List & Rating: "Speakerboxx"   1 - Intro (NOT RATED)  2 - GhettoMusick (3 1/2 Stars)  3 - Unhappy (3 Stars)  4 - Bowtie f/ Sleepy Brown & Jazze Pha (4 Stars)  5 - The Way You Move f/ Sleepy Brown (4 1/2 Stars)  6 - The Rooster (3 Stars)  7 - Bust f/ Killer Mike (4 Stars)  8 - War (4 Stars)  9 - Church (3 1/2 Stars)  10 - Bamboo (Interlude) (NOT RATED)  11 - Tomb Of The Boom f/ Konkrete, Big Gipp & Ludacris (4 Stars)  12 - E-Mac (Interlude) (NOT RATED)  13 - Knowing (4 Stars)  14 - Flip Flop Rock f/ Killer Mike & Jay-Z (4 1/2 Stars)  15 - Interlude (NOT RATED)  16 - Reset f/ Khujo Goodie & Cee-Lo (5 Stars)  17 - D-Boi (Interlude) (NOT RATED)  18 - Last Call f/ Slimm Calhoun, Lil Jon & The East Side Boyz & Mello (3 1/2 Stars)  19 - Bowtie (Postlude) (NOT RATED)      Big Boi's half of this double album, known as Speakerboxx kicks off with a skippable intro, which then leads us into "GhettoMusick".   The synthesized beat immediately kicks in, making you think that it would be some sort of up-tempo techno track. After a bit of the beat playing, we get some quick, danceable, party music and Big Boi kicking off a flow. The sound of the song is fast and smooth, perfect for those long high-way drives. Big Boi sings for the first part, and raps for the latter part. I like to consider this an introductory track, experimenting with techno, R&B, and hip-hop elements. As a sidenote, id like to say that i am a huge fan of experimental music. I love it, which is why i enjoyed the most recent experimental musical albums such as Phrenology by the Roots and Electric Circus by Common. When classic, well-respected artists decide to cross into new styles of music, its always interesting and fun to me, and those with an open-mind.   "Bowtie" features the southern, P-funkish elements which make Outkast who they are. Featuring some slamming trumpets, that typical Dungeon Family singing, and some nice guitars, Big Boi drops some pretty dope lyrics about a certain female who can't seem to get off his mind. The track might seem a bit commercial, but its a pleasure to listen to due to the lyricism of Big Boi and the dope production done by Jazze Pha (who is typically a commercial producer, but has his moments). Big Boi proves on this track that he is indeed still a dope rapper, and has yet to fall off.   "The Way You Move" is Big Boi's lead single.   Big Boi's unbelievably creative lyrics adds some nostalgia, taking us back to the groups' extraordinarily light-hearted work found on Aquemeni. The production is one of those pieces that will be stuck in your head for ages to come, with its pounding trumpets. The background R&B/soul vocals only add to the song, giving the song an unforgettable, seductive feeling to it. Big Boi's mic presence is unforgettable, and this is an ideal lead single for Big Boi.   Killer Mike joins Big Boi on "Bust". The melodic production is dope, and the background vocals are reminiscent of some of the silly singing found on D-12's debut Devil's Night. Killer Mike and Big Boi drop ill introspective verses, reminiscing about the past. The production is, as expected, loud and pounding, but also melodic and listenable. Immediately with the first listen, you can tell this is an Outkast track, and a damn good one at that.   "Church" has the incredible makings of a classic, but is shut down by seemingly annoying and overabusive production. The subject matter revolves around Big Boi questioning his religion due to the problems surrounding not only himself, but the entire world. Big Boi mixes introspection with some creativity and heart, backed by some thought-provoking lyrics. Lyrically and Subject-Matter-wise, this track is dope, but the production and organization needs a lot of work. As i said earlier, youve got to have an open musical mind and be a fan of true hip-hop lyricism and elements in order to fully appreciate the experimental sounds found on Speakerboxx.   Skipping ahead we arrive at "Flip Flop Rock". A commercial Jay-Z joins Killer Mike and Big Boi on this dope introspective collaborative crew joint. Big Boi touches on street violence, racism, and oppression that is seemingly killing the blacks of this country, as well as the other kids in the streets. Big Boi's introspective lyrics and political views are interesting, and add a new twist to those who doubted how ill of an emcee he is. The melodic hook is one of those dope ones, but soon Jay-Z appears on the track and gives us some egotistical, somewhat materialistic lyrics. I dont understand all of the hype over Jay-Z's Black Album due to the fact that Jay-Z is nowhere near showing me that he is going to change, and turn underground again. His verse on this song is very commercial, and leads me to believe that his so-called "final" album might just be a repeat of other washouts he's had in the past. I sure hope not... because the heads deserve a LOT more.   Its interesting that the Dungeon Family themselves provide the first true classic on Speakerboxx, that being "Reset".   Cee-Lo and Khujo Goodie from Goodie Mob join up with Big Boi to give us the dopest song on Big Boi's disc. The slow-tempo production and haunting background vocals provide an amazing atmosphere, and a somewhat nostalgic trip back to the days of the classic ATLiens, where Outkast gave us a classic-filled album of this caliber. Big Boi, Cee-Lo and Khujo drop some memorably DOPE introspective verses, touches on the evils of the world from government, to racists, to life itself. The overall feel of the track is unbelievable, as it is a true classic.   Speakerboxx is nowhere near being as good as any of the previous Outkast albums by themselves. Its obvious to me that Big Boi fits a LOT better with Andre 3000 than without him. This album, unlike his partner's disc, stays true to hip-hop and retains the traditional Outkast sound for most of the tracks, along with a few new soundscapes and experimental sounds. This album incorporates lots of guests, but the majority do a great job and manage to keep up with Big Boi. A lot of the songs are bangers, and it stays at a great level of quality, but nowhere near the classics that they have put out in the past. However, Speakerboxx is a pretty dope stand-alone album with its share of hits and misses.   3.75 Stars      -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Moving On, we now arrive to Andre 3000's somewhat solo effort, known as The Love Below. This is about as farfetched as Andre has ever gone in his career. Experimentation and Eclectic music is the name of the game here, as Andre gives us some unique musical landscapes, touching on every single musical style thinkable, from jazz, to soul, to R&B, to hip-hop, to rock, and beyond. As i said at the beginning of this review, i am a huge fan of experimentation by artists who have already proven themselves, thus i fully respect Andre's decision to explore his creativity as he has done on The Love Below. Staying true to hip-hop is something that i treasure, but Andre has proven in the past that he is capable of doing that, so i will review this album on a completely unbiased level.

The song captures an unbelievable early decade style of mo-town jazz, which im sure older musical fans will be thrilled to listen to. The piano melodies and trumpets give the song a very Tom Jones-like feel, where singing was the main operative. Of course, Andre 3000 isn't just an ordinary artist, and i consider him one of the true innovators of not just hip-hop music, but all sorts of musical styles. Fans of the traditional Outkast style might shun at this, but for once, listen to Big D: It helps to have an open mind.   The album continues with "Happy Valentine's Day".   Kicking off with a thumping bass kick, drums, and claps, we immediately get some funky guitars. Immediately you know that Andre decides to experiment with a funkish style of music on this track, with a tiny ounce of R&B and Soul. Andre's singing talent is off the charts, and i truly believe his skills are largely underrated. The background singing vocals give the song a unique, early 70s soul feel, with some funk. When it comes to subject matter, Andre stresses the importance of "Valentine's Day" and how love makes the world go round. Forget your typical rapping here, Andre once again sings, and does a damn good job of it.   Andre 3000 goes to pure R&B/Soul with "Prototype". The song title doesn't exactly sound like it would be a love song, but it is. Throughout the majority of the song, we have a nice soulful vocal display by Andre, along with background synthesizers, guitars, and pianos to add to the mood. The slow-tempo feel of the song gives it a relaxing atmosphere as Andre shows off once again his vocal skills.   "She Lives In My Lap" is an unbelievable display of honesty, even though its not exactly the same opinion that I have. Andre deals with the fact that he seemingly cannot stay in a relationship because of the mere fact that he keeps females and enjoys their company hoping to get into their pants. The subject matter is honest, yet shallow due to the fact that Andre can be easily critiqued for not giving a f*ck about a women unless she f*cks him. He admits it on an honest level, and behind an unbelievable mix of vocals and production. However, i wonder if he was actually telling the truth, or if he just wanted a little bit of controversy and/or needed a song idea. Who knows?   Up next is Andre 3000's lead single, entitled "Hey Ya". The fast tempo, guitarish beat giving the track an amazing light-hearted feel. However, besides the excellent, fast tempo production, Andre 3000 spits fire with his amazing vocal display. The song has a very mid 50's sort of quirky feel to it, making it one of those songs that many heads are afraid to admit they enjoy. Me? I love it. The beat is tight, the singing is amazing, and its difficult for you not to enjoy this melodic musical medley. I feel as if Andre chose the perfect lead single, just like i felt Big Boi did on his album.   "Roses" and "Behold a Lady" are eerily similar love songs. Both songs feature some seductive, R&B/soul vocals directed to a woman. Keeping the familiar Outkast P-Funk, mixed with new forms of music and nice melodies is something that Andre has seemingly perfected the art of doing this merger. The second track of the two is a much more up-tempo track, with a tiny bit more seductiveness to it, and some more appeal. The synthesized melody is different than the last, proving that the only familiar parts would be the seductiveness of the vocals and Andre's choice of subject matter.   The Love Below hits a speed bump with "Pink & Blue". I appreciate the elceptiveness of the album, as long as it makes sense. What we have here is a cadre of sounds put together in a fast pace, making the song sound like a complete mess, and almost unlistenable. Thusfar, this is the only extremely weak moment on either album.   Skipping ahead past some of the average moments of The Love Below, we get to the closing track, strangely titled "A Life In The Day Of Benjamin Andre". Believe it or not, Andre does something on this track which he has yet to do... and thats RAP!!!! Unbelievably enough, Andre ends his disc with what brought him to the fame in the first place. Production-wise, its pretty simplistic, with drums, a clap, and some weird background effects. This song feels a lot like something that was pulled from ATLiens, due to its simple production and song concept. The subject matter is creative as f*ck, as Andre uses his "art of storytelling" to summarize his entire life into one day. The song has no catchy hook of any sort, but that doesn't matter due to the fact that Andre gets personal, even touching on his relationship with Erykah Badu. A fitting close to Andre's disc.   The Love Below is eclectic, unique, and at times just plain bizarre, but its primarily good. The musical variety is shown, and Andre's maturity and growth as an artist is something to give praise about. His disc is filled with mainly good or great songs, and pretty much only one flaw. Old-school Outkast fans probably wont dig it too much unless they have an open mind, and most likely neither will backpacker heads. However, i truly believe that this is an album not only for hip-hop fans, but for fans of all music respectfully.   4 Stars     -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------     In listening to Speakerboxx/The Love Below as a combined album, i often wondered if Big Boi and Andre 3000 could really separate and keep apart without losing a tad bit of the quality. I mean, lets be honest, they are an unbelievable duo and their different points of view as well as rhyme styles create a wonderful landscape of lyricism and music. Apparently, they indeed prove that they can. I honestly had no clue what to expect from this album except that i honestly trust Outkast to give us good music, and im glad i did. I always walk into an Outkast album with an open mind set, and i always walk out with a smile knowing that they have yet to make a bad album.   The question on many fans minds is: which album is better? Well, in my own personal opinion, Andre 3000's album is slightly better and much more consistent this time around, and the music is unbelievable. However, Big Boi's album is much more true to hip-hop with lyricism and such. My conclusion to this is that i highly appreciate that Outkast gave us 2 discs this time around, but i believe that they belong together in order to give us the true classics which they are more than capable of. Their experimentation is great, and this album will always be treasured by their fans, but i do believe that their part should only be temporary. It was dope how its 2 discs for the price of one, and thats even MORE the reason for me to reccomend Speakerboxx/The Love Below. It is a dope album loaded with stuff to please everybody... so get yourself a copy as soon as you can.   Overall Rating:  4 Stars +music
great album+P+I don't really write reviews but I wanted to throw in here that this is a great album, because there are so few reviews of it.  If you liked his first you will like this to; I don't find either one any better or worse.    Also, watching that video they've got on this amazon page, he seems to be pretty great live.  But really, there's not much else to say: If you liked his first, you won't be disappointed by this one. +music
Pretty good selection of songs+P+Wow - this cd set has it all!  I particulary like the 4th cd and play it all the time for my 3 month old.  You'll definitely enjoy hours upon hours of kiddie music+music
Baaa baaa, music for sheep (0 stars)+N+Emo noisemaking and Christian themes. The two worst elements of our society combined in a package filled with talentless musicianship. Face it kids this is a fad. A really pathetic fad. Disco was a fad and they has thousands upon thousands of drones listening and participating in the Disco scene. The same happened with Hair Metal and Nu-Metal. Those scenes are completely dead and gone and so will this one be one day. You will look back on this period of your life tied up in this fad in embarrasment of your blatant stupidity. As I always say in my reviews, this is trash and should be treated so accordingly. This band should take their Emo wrist cutting lyrics to heart and kill themselves for the better of humanity.+music
With deeper listens...+P+....I have found that Incubus' masterpiece "Make Yourself" is much more of an obscure Progressive Metal album than a Nu-Metal album. Take some deep listens into this album, and you will see that the musical progression of each song fits perfectly into the moniker of Progressive Metal,with a lot of funk, Hip Hop and Nu-Metal tossed into the mix. Each song progresses with perfection and every note played is placed in just right. Even Brandon Boyd's amazing vocals are progressive, as is the concept of the album, which is making yourself out of your own ideas, thoughts and beliefs, not letting the Government, Authorities and the world shape what you believe and feel. The guitar riffs are intricate and amazing, as is the funky bass lines and the tight drumming. The DJ adds much atmosphere and ambience to the record as well. Brandon's vocals are superb, having a wide range and deep metaphoric lyricism. I took this album for granted ever since I first picked it up, but in the new perception that I am in now, I appreciate it much more. I feel that it takes time for the true goodies hidden in the compositions of this album to come to the surface, and a face value listen won't reveal anything beyond a great "Nu-Metal/Rock/Funk" record. I think this is Incubus at their finest(which many would argue with, citing "Science" as their best. True, I feel that Science is amazing as well and shows elements of Progression, but its "Make Yourself" where they reach their pinnacle). Do yourself a favor and pick this album up, if you can get past the whole Nu-Metal Stigma, you will find a true gem that is worth many repeated listens+music
Nina Persson and friends+P+Nina Persson's "debut solo album" (as described on the promo sticker) began life in Sweden in 1998, the same year as the Cardigans' Gran Turismo. It was completed in America throughout 2000 with producer Mark Linkous from the excellent Sparklehorse, during time off from the Cardigans, which had clearly taken on a life of its own, not entirely of her choosing.  A Camp was born in 1997 after a meeting with Niclas Frisk, who co-wrote most of the songs and plays on several of them. Boyfriend Nathan Larson (from Shudder To Think) also plays on all but one of the tracks and co-wrote the opening song. Frequent Flyer sets the mood of the album as it opens with eerie samples, theremin sounds, thuddy drums and Nina's gorgeously bittersweet vocals over an engaging melody. In fact the tunes retain a high standard throughout and the quirky production (though mainstream by Sparklehorse standards) is never less than complementary and interesting. Angel Of Sadness is a stand-out song although I Can Buy You made a first class single. Although the album consists mostly of original material, a few stray covers shoe-horn their way in - the Replacements' Rock 'n' Roll Ghost; bizarrely, Restless Heart's old US hit The Bluest Eyes In Texas; and Walking The Cow, one of the best known songs of cult singer Daniel Johnston, whose 2003 album Fear Yourself was also produced by Mark Linkous. A Camp manages the delicate trick of being unmistakably, instantly belonging to Nina Persson whilst at the same time being quite distinct from the Cardigans. May her future projects be as successfu+music
Pure form of Art+P+I've been a fan of the Cardigans ever since their first CD release in USA and when i've heard that some band members were doing solo I was very anxious to hear them.  I think that Nina's CD is art in its purest form.  Each song is carefully put together like a collage to form a trully unique piece.  I found my self experiencing different moods as I listened to each of the songs.  Some other very good songs were actually not released on this cd.  Songs such as &quot;Charlie Charle&quot;, &quot;My Misery is my Mystery&quot;, and &quot;What the hell are you crying for?&quot; but dont worry you can still hear these songs.  For those of you who don't know Nina has a special website for her CD its : http://www.acamp.cjb.net/.  There she has an option of listening the unreleased songs.  I hope this review has helped you in some way+music
More Carpetbagger BS+N+Wow, another buncha poetry school dropout pouting girls clutching "banjers" and "gitars" wearing old dresses and ripping off Appalachian and southern culture while the ripping off is good. Tune in next year and the BGTs will be putting out a Calypso record. Another one for the "No Depression" poop pile+music
Not What I Wanted+N+The Title of this CD threw me off; the description and the first review didn't help either.  The primary reason for buying this CD was the song "You Are My Sister", but this version is a duet with someone that can't sing. I can't tell which CD has a version of the song as seen on Letterman. Disappointing+music
Thom's Tourettes+N+Ok first off I love radiohead -pablo honey up through the electronic swarms of Kid A, as well as the avant-garde Amnesiac. So I guess I am confused why I DONT like this...  it's boring? it's like white bread, flat and blah... and with no real substance? Thom isn't covering any new territory here lyrically, or melodically.  The electronics don't supplement his voice either... each song opens with inessential spastic ticking of naked techno beats...then a layer more or two before Thom chimes in with a droning melody that sounds like he's dragging his feet over routine tones.   I'm left understimulated and quite unimpressed. I even question Thom's concept of quality... Surely he knew that this was subpar... nevertheless it was packaged, shipped and is displayed on shelves at the right eye level to lure dollars- all because of name recognition. We learned our lesson with George W. Bush, let's not relive it in the vein of cult music.  If only I had an Eraser, that I could wipe this disappointment from my memory+music
very disappointing+N+I bought this CD because it got a lot of good reviews, and the description sounded like something I would enjoy. However, it turned out to be an atrocious CD. It is very repetitive and monotonous throughout. The songs pretty much all sound the same. There's little melodic variation, and the vocals have basically no range. The lyrics are extremely uninspired. I'm glad I bought this used at a cheap price. I don't know if I'm going to give it away or just throw it away; it's that bad.+music
A must have for your child+P+I can't believe someone would not enjoy this CD. My 2 kids ( ages 1 and 2 1/2) love this CD. Sometimes it is the only thing that will keep them happy. I will admit, if you are new to Laurie Berkner, it seems a little boring at first. But, after listening to it a couple of times, it is incredible. the words are so easy to learn and the tunes are catchy. I don't even mind if they are trapped in my head all day (unlike the other kid songs we have). We also have We Are the Dinosaurs, and love that one, too. I can't wait to get Laurie's other 2 CDs. I tell everyone about Laurie Berkner, she is a true gem+music
What is this?+N+We all have different taste and I am trying to consider this. But to me this is just another artist who had a strange idea and we are bying it and help him to live a good life. Nickelodeon and even the Disney channel featuring him. My little girl and I listened to two songs that they played on the Disney channel over and over.Malti is the song she really started to listen to. Honestly. The only reason why that song is so great is Barbara's voice and singing ability. Dave can't sing and shouldn't even try to sing in Spanish. The tune is catchy and we find us humming along. SO I ordered this CD. What a joke. Most of the time you can't evne understand what he is saying and it is not as if he came up with new songs. He has the known children songs for the most part and just puts his own twist on it. But it is not entertaining for little ones.My daughter keeps asking: What is this? Till Malti comes on and then she and I are relieved and hum along with joy and glee. Thank you Barbara for saving this song. I even bought another CD thinking perhaps I just got a bad one and the next are better. I am disappointed with that one as well. So you take a song like Somewhere over the rainbow and put a new rythm on it. Wopee. I like it but it isn't worth it to me and I admit I have no idea or clue who this artist is and where he came from and what his background is but honestly.. he is overrated and sold. There is a song with Cheryl Crow on it. Okay. SO I am thinking this will be fun perhaps. Only to find that I want to shake him and her for again not putting some fun and step and pep into a song. I guess I am not a alternative and don't appreciate the earthy balance the musicians bring to the music. I want some rythm and clap your hands together and sing along type of music for my children. This type of stuff is something a teenager can appreicate later on only that the songs are too young for them at that time. My children have NO clue what this is about and can't figure it out. And we listen to everything from Disney to Classic, to Broadway. YOu name it. So we are not just Sesame Street CD lovers. But this music is a joke. No talent. ONE tone of voice and as if he forgets to open his teeth while singing. Barbar saves this CD but what a waste of money for ONE song. DON"T BUY IT. And all these people who fall for it.. grrrr. It is like a art gallerie. Everyone stands in front of the picture that shows a green dot. And they come up with tons of explanations what it may be and how fantastic the artist is. And in reality he is sitting back and chuckling because he just ran short of a painting and spilled his paint brush while cleaning it. Give me a break. Shame on Disney and Nickelodeon to fall into this as well. And taking out great singers and shorten real talents opportunity. WOw, guess you can tell I am not into it. ;0(  Explore, again.. everyone has different taste. But I just don't get it, nor like it. I find it horrible.   +music
holy whack!+P+this album good. me like very much.if you no like it, go f*** yourself. if you no like it, you suck more then me english. Actually, my english is not bad at all. This album is great. The beat can be memorized until doomsday and Eminem kicked a**. But Bizzare stunk,except he was pretty good on one track. But Bizzare's crappy voice and flows does not screw up this album. Go buy this album now. When you hear it, you will go crazy over it. If you don't, the Devil is ready to welcome you into hell.+music
what were they thinking?+N+I can't believe some of the songs on this soundtrack...they are horrible pieces of S$#!?*&%#!#$!There are a couple good ones,but its not worth spending the money on for the c.d,not even at a used price.I can't believe they did'nt put "Low Rider" on the soundtrack,how cheap is that+music
the escalator +P+the escalator and the man stand at the bottom summed up the album even before i had the pleasure of listening to such beauty and intelligence in my entire life time of listening to folk rock music this has affected me the most i can't tell how much..  i know it's an clinche but.it left me speechless i didn't know whether to cry jump up and down with merriment of..just sit quietly and seep in the beauty i had just been laid next too me.  all them emotions from a voice guitar and a trumpet at the end of broken arrows   how do you say can that happen? because this guy has talent. to transmit an beauty and vibrance over to the listeners ears  in my mind you have to be in tune with yourself to fully appreciate the album.    we all have these emotions in us to appreciate this album  on another level and i have and i won't be turning back it changed my life this afternoon.. the escalator only goes up..    +music
Awful, Awful,Awful+N+One great ballad, Evermore Without You, doth not a musical make. That song is stunning, slightly pedestrian lyrics not withstanding. The rest of the show is simply dreadful. Some is downright irritating." A secret, a secret.....", that line plays on the nerves like a rat gnawing on the fingernails. Horrible. I have a secret, stay away from this ridiculous mess. The plot is ludicrous, and the performances dull. They all sing it like they know how awful it is. And Michael Crawford has reached a new low in his mediocre career.  Hopefully someone like Barbara Cook or John Barrowman will record Evermore Without You, so the world can appreciatte it without having to go near this embarrassing trash.  Sir Andrew, c'mon, surely you can come up with something better than this+music
Mediocre Rapper Takes Over The World!+N+First off, Kanye West is about as mediocre a rapper as it comes. He looks plain, sounds plain, and if it wasn't for the controversy that surrounds him, everyone would be like "Who Cares?" But while he sings about Jesus and lives like he is a prophet, there is no substance to him and his music. Lame beats, hypocritical lyrics, this is the core of what is wrong in secular music today. His interviews show him as arrogant, racist, and unlovable, but it is selling his music and that's what he cares about. So while his rapping voice is mediocre and his rhymes are abysmal and his life is lukewarm, he is sure to sell records galore and people will adore his hypocrisy (and their own hypocrisy). So let's be real for a second, because I am about to give you the best CD you will hear in years - it's a mixture of rap and rock, with (real!) beats, acoustic guitar, splashes of piano, and a voice that can sound like Chris Martin of Coldplay one second and then rap like LL Cool J the next...buy today Mat Kearney's "Nothing Left To Lose." The best CD of 2006 and without an ounce of hyprocrisy while being true to himself+music
Hideous Arrangments !!! - Stay clear. 1 of Dylan's Worst !!!+N+I'm a huge dylan fan - and collector  (I have around 120 or so of his albums, bootlegs, shows etc.). This is one of his worst ever - if not The worst - the only redeeming feature - the singing is not bad - even good on afew tracks. Docendo Discimus is dead right - spot on criticism - I could/t have said it better myself - so I won't try. anyone, IMH, who gives this album more than 3 stars is of his rocker..+music
And People Buy This? +N+One of the most ridiculous pieces of minimalist trash out there. It just goes to show you where a lot of time, a lot of money, popular culture, and a twisted world view have landed so much of American. Don't waste your time or your money on this.+music
To be honest...+N+Not the best score I've ever heard. Certainly not bad, some tracks were very nice. Unfortunately, a good deal of them are too action-oriented for my liking, or simply boring. The best piece of music from the film, the beautifully haunting female chorus played over the spider pit scene (best part of the movie!), is sadly nowhere to be found on this disc. I don't doubt Howard's talent as a composer, but the music for King Kong, sadly, doesn't have the same bite as the movie.+music
Adds most of the missing pieces of the puzzle+P+The first Band box-set, "Across the Great Divide," was a disappointing ripoff, so this is long overdue.  And it's also worth the wait!  Others have criticized this set for having nothing completists won't already have.  I disagree.  I've been a serious Band fan for about a decade, and there are rarities on here that I'd never even heard of until now.  So for all but the hardest of hardcore fans, this is a welcome surprise.  Not perfect, but close enough.  If the accompanying book is correct, even the Band members themselves had forgotten about a couple of the previously unreleased tracks.  As for the rest of us, if there's a mid-60s recording you've heard of but never heard up to now, chances are it's here.  The 1964 single "Uh Uh Uh"/"Leave Me Alone" - which was considered "lost" a few years ago - is here, and it sounds terrific.  All three of the 1965 Atco sides are here (only one, "He Don't Love You," was previously available on CD).  The studio recording of their cover of Bobby Blue Bland's "Honky Tonk" was an especially nice surprise for me; I'd heard an extremely low-fi live recording of it before but didn't know they'd ever officially recorded it.  There are a few surprises among their better-known work as well, notably the newly restored coda in "To Kingdom Come."    What is less satisfying is the selection of previously released tracks.  I know no box set is ever going to satisfy all of a given act's fans, but the previously-released portion of this set seems particularly haphazard, especially the recordings with Ronnie Hawkins and Bob Dylan.  Where is "High Blood Pressure," the only Hawkins single on which Robbie, Levon, Rick, Richard and Garth all played?  What about the myriad still-unreleased Basement Tapes that are rumored to exist?  (There are a few new releases from those sessions here, including a great early version of "Caledonia Mission," but if the rumors are true it's still a drop in the bucket.)  And why does every Band best-of have to include the supremely overrated "It Makes No Difference" and omit the beautiful "Hobo Jungle"?  Minor complaints, I concede, especially since anyone who likes the Band well enough to shell out for this collection will probably also have most or all of their original albums anyhow.  The DVD is a great addition as well, particularly the Saturday Night Live performances from just a few weeks before The Last Waltz.  Seeing the guys play together at that late date is almost surreal for those of us who know, er, the shape they were in, if you will.  If you want everything, this will get you close to it, at least+music
Laid Back EC, Living and Loving in South Florida+P+I have to confess that, while I love Clapton, his albums are often a hit-and-miss affair.  And I can't say I am a fan of the numerous recent blues tribute albums he has put out lately.  For me I enjoy his work with Cream, his guest work, his first few albums, the one he recorded with The Band, a few older live albums, and bits of the Phil Collins-produced record in the early 80s.  After that it's a fall-off, but I am thankful for all the great music he has turned out over the years.  I have been listening to 461 a lot lately.  It holds up exceedingly well.  The groove is laid-back, with solid musicianship and expert song selection.  It makes for great road music, especially "Willie and the Hand Jive," "I Shot the Sheriff," and the classic closer, "Mainline Florida."  The ballads are beautiful, too.  There is not a weak track on the album.  There is a consistent tone, an aversion to excess and a concentration on the note and harmonic "fit" that makes this album an overall winner in EC's catalog.  As someone who used to party in EC's old house at 461 Ocean Boulevard in Golden Beach in the early 80s, let me say -- you did it (and us) proud+music
Sour Cream+N+32 years ago I was so stoked that Clapton was finally coming out with a new album, I walked five miles to Deorsey's Records in Lewiston, Maine the day that it was released to buy this much anticipated record. The still near virgin vinyl remains in my LP collection and has only been played once. Once was enough. Heroin robbed a true master of his creativeness, inspiration and technical ability. Sad.+music
Ahhhhhhhh refreshing+P+Like crackin open a cold beer. This is hip hop ya'll. This what needs to be on the airwaves. This whole album is listenable. No poppy fluff here. Just a dope MC paintin pictures with words and not videos. How dudes like JOC D4L and franchize boys sell records is still beyond me. Support real hip hop and buy this. You wont regret it+music
A very Good Debut album+P+Sheryl Crow has become one of my favorite artists. Several of my favorite songs appear on this album. Run, Baby Run opens the album in good form. Leaving Las Vegas is next. Strong Enough is probably my favorite song by Sheryl ever. I love the acoustic guitar. All I Wanna Do turned out to be a major hit for her and probably launched the career. I Shall Believe is another great song. This is a must for any fan of Sheryl Crows+music
I think he needs a pad and a pen.+N+As another person mentioned, I am no where near a bow bow hater. I remember feeling some type of way about liking him when he was younger because I seldom dig commercial rap. So now he's all grown up and doing his thing. He had a couple of hits.  One day I'm online reading about this guy hating on Will Smith and I later learned that this guy doesn't even write his own music. WHAT?!  Are you kidding me. No matter who the remarks was to, one cannot disrespect another rapper when they don't even write their own music. After hearing that I was just done. How can you rate his music when he is not writing it? What are we rating his sound over the music because he has no connection with it. I think it was just ok. "Fresh as I am" was hot. I was really feeling that sound. I like ok, he's all grown up and showing people what he is made up but again later I learned he didn't write it....lol..that'f funny. Is this how Jermain Dupri feels? Can the real rapper please stand up+music
give me a break+N+Normally, I am very open to listening to new music -especially scenster/indie-hop - and when, months ago now, I'd heard about the Bravery I was intrigued. I turned on the radio here in San Francisco to the best indie station on the planet and kept my ears open. I remember hearing a song and thinking, "wow, the Strokes' new song is amazingly good." Then, when the announcer stated that the song was in fact performed by The Bravery, I was horrified.   Simply stated: how are these guys NOT the Strokes? Sorry, but they sound exactly like them... but not as good. Lyrically, they are not as original and the lead singer does not have the same passion or enthusiasm in his voice as the lead singer for the Strokes.   However, lucky for the Bravery, people are actually buying that they are a unique and catchy band. What a joke+music
IT'S BEEN WELL OVER THIRTY YEARS AND I+P+I HAVE HAD IT SINCE IT CAME OUT IN 1973, AND ITS' STILL AS GOOD TODAY AS IT WAS BACK THEN. WOW THERE ARE CERTAINLY ARE A LOT OF REVIEWS WRITTEN ABOUT THIS RECORD.IT IS HARD TO DESCRIBE THIS ALBUM, IT'S NOT QUITE JAZZ, IT'S NOT QUITE "FUNK", IT'S NOT QUITE "FUSION" MUSIC, IT STANDS ON ITS' OWN AS SOMETHING ELSE.  KIND OF A COMBINATION OF ALL THREE.  AT THE TIME, KEYBOARD INNOVATIONS WERE REALLY COMING INTO VOGUE AND HERBIE REALLY KNEW HOW TO EXPLOIT IT ON THIS ALBUM.  BETTER THAN HIS LATER ELECTRONIC STUFF, WHICH WAS A LOT MORE COMMERCIAL.  OTHER CONTEMPORARIES FROM THIS TIME INCLUDE CHICK COREA, JAN HAMMER, GEORGE DUKE, AND TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, STEVIE WONDER. +music
A very good collection..more than just the 4 singles+P+Boyz II Men made it huge in the 90s by pairing up their tight harmonies recalling classic Motown groups (Temps and Tops) with more up-to-date rhythmic tracks incorporating samples and other hip-hop stylings. This album broke them into superstardom as their followup to "Cooleyhighharmony", placing 4 songs into the charts for the Philadelphia group.   HIGHLIGHTS: This album pretty much divides into 2 'sides': The uptempo side (before "Khalil") and the ballads afterwards. Most of the biggest chart tunes fall in the 2nd half.  Part 1 has "Thank You" (the only up-tempo chart hit), an infectious number riding a Doug E. Fresh sample. "Vibin'" is a nice midtempo groove though the lyric's  pretty lightweight (We're just vibin'/dancin' the night away/Groovin'/Vibin'/non-stop until the break of day). "I Sit Away" is a Tony Rich tune about drowning in self pity that stops short of being maudlin. (This and "Nobody Knows"..is Rich clinically depressed or what?)   In the "slow side", Babyface's "I'll Make Love to you" set a record for the length of time at #1. "On Bended Knee" (from Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis) and "Water Runs Dry" (another Babyface composition) also made some chart action. The group shows off their sterling harmonies on the Beatles classic "Yesterday" and they pull off the true feat of not embarrassing themselves on a rock classic. It's a wonderful rendition.  LOWS: "All Around the World" is Boyz II Men's rewrite of Ricky Nelson's "Travelin' Man" more or less, but not nearly as memorable. Considering how pivotal it is to the album, "Khalil" is a pretty blah track. "Jezzebel" is a dull overlong affair. "50 Candles" includes the lyric "Holding your body like a plastic molding"....'nuff said.   BOTTOM LINE: There are enough hits to make this a mini-greatest hits all by itself, but the extras like "I Sit By" and "Yesterday" make this one worth owning. Recommended for R&B fans+music
When R&B was something special+P+With the founding father of R&B groups New Edition doing the solo thing in the early nineties and Boyz II Men still a year or so away, Troop was the premire R&B group of 1990. The songs Spread My Wings, All I Do Is Think Of You and I Will Always Love are some of the best songs to come out of early 90's R&B and the boys earned their spot in R&B in my opinion+music
DISSAPOINTING+N+HE SOULD KEEP WRITING RYMES FOR OTHER PEOPLE I LOVE RBX AND THE WORK HE DOES WITH OTHERS BUT ON HIS OWN NOT SO GOO+music
Fantastic CD+P+Michael Buble is phenomenal.  Song number 5 HOME is a choker-upper at our houses, but we all love it and sing it out loud.  Right now our family is separated by miles - but not for too much longer - the CD has tremendous sentimental value in our homes already and we will still be singing it I'm sure when we are all reunited again+music
Awesome Soundtrack!+P+The National Treasure soundtrack is one of my favorites. It's up-beat, and fast-paced, and very energetic. It has an interesting mix of orchestral, techno, and rock music - put together in a very creative way. It doesn't have many of those moments of miscillaneous chords wandering around everywhere like alot of soundtracks I've heard do. The only thing is that there are only a few themes and they are repeated a lot. So, listening to it TO much may get you tired of those themes pretty quickly. Other than that, I've REALLY enjoyed listening to it - and I highly reccommend it+music
The Trouble With Tributes+N+The trouble with all-star tribute albums to past superstar artists and bands is that oftentimes they are done purely for money, attention, and a sense that certain of those artists can one-up the artists being paid the "tribute" to; and often, the results don't come close to measuring up to the originals.  Such, I'm afraid, is the case with the 1993 COMMON THREADS album, where Nashville artists give their props to that renegade bunch of desperados who occupied the Hotel California for most of the 1970s, the Eagles.  The brainchild of Eagles manager Irving Azoff, who saw how revered the band had become amongst the Nashville hierarchy of the Nineties, COMMON THREADS also functioned as a charity album, whose profits went to the Walden Woods Project, of which Eagles drummer Don Henley was a particularly prominent supporter.  Were it not for that one particular aspect, COMMON THREADS would be as much an aberration as a lot of other tribute albums of its type.  Even as this album already stands, however, and even though it caused hell to freeze over and the Eagles to reunite, the artists here still fall well short of what the band originally did.  What seems to have happened here is that each of the artists got so caught up in the idea of doing songs from the Eagles' massively successful catalog that they thought they could get off by copying almost note-for-note and by arrangement what the band had done; one listen to Travis Tritt's version of "Take It Easy", and Vince Gill's take on "I Can't Tell You Why" seems to indicate this.  In other cases, they sound terribly anemic, as in Clint Black's version of "Desperado", where he sounds like second-rate John Denver (and I think John Denver could have done this far better than Clint Black).  And hearing faux-Eagles wanna-bes like Little Texas doing "Peaceful Easy Feeling" and Diamond Rio doing "Lyin' Eyes" is no substitute whatsoever for the real thing.  The womenfolk don't have it much easier either.  Lorrie Morgan simply sounds out of place on "The Sad Cafe", seemingly not having any idea about the song's mournful inspiration; and Tanya Tucker's toughness on "Already Gone" is quite dull.  Suzy Bogguss' take on "Take It To The Limit" is a bit better, but it won't make anyone forget the Randy Meisner-led original. And Trisha Yearwood's version of "New Kid In Town" is okay, but she sounds like she's trying to do it the way she thinks her idol Linda Ronstadt would, and it's not totally successful either.  In the end, the inability of contemporary Nashville artists to really understand the Eagles lies in the fact that there is a very wide gap between the Eagles' sound of the 1970s and the way contemporary Music Row does things.  Though classified as "country-rock", the Eagles also mixed in elements of bluegrass, surf-rock, R&B, disco, and even Tex-Mex a time or two, styles that are largely alien to contemporary Nashville.  As Linda herself, around whom the Eagles originally formed in 1971, has said, it is a part of the diverse spectrum of California music: "California music is a real hybrid, very specialized, and it doesn't have anything to do with Nashville."  This is something that I'm not sure these artists really understand, and why I can't give this album a better rating+music
He's not quite there yet...+N+Apart from some reasonable songs (One Wish - Track 4, War is Over Track 8), I really didn't feel like this album was all there. To be honest I haven't really taken the time to listen to most of the tracks & in hindsight I wouldn't have bought this CD. His talent is clear but a little more tweaking at the studio may be warranted!+music
Scraping the bottom of the barrel+N+As if Toxicity wasnt mediocre enough, this just takes everything that was once good and dumps all over it. Where do we place the blame? Is it Darons poor songwriting skills? Or maybe its the dropping of the once thrash-driven riffs and drums in favor of a more accessible MTV-whitewashed corporate music that everyone and their parents would eat up? Or maybe theirs just no more soul left in a once killer band that was a breath of fresh era from all that nu-metal garbage that invaded the radio and TV?   Whichever one you choose, this is not the SOAD we all love, this is an unoriginal rehash of Toxicity. Oh wow, they have an anti-government song? So what, who hasnt made one of those. And anti-war songs? Travel back to the 60s, they were chock full full of them. Everything I hear is uninspired and downright lazy. Its also unfortunate that Serj got sidelined by Daron "I wish I had talent" Malakian, for he literally tries too hard to make interesting songs, while coming out in the end as those annoying kids that have ADHD in your classroom that are just seriously not funny.  Maybe im being to harsh, but you would be annoyed too if a once great band betrayed their pre-Toxicity fanbase in order to get more money and exposure, and in turn seem hypocritical to their lyrics.  You want to get good music, get SOAD's self titled, its their best and the only one that wasnt corrupted by the capitalist pigs known as MTV. +music
Awesome Instrumental!!!+P+I have been addicted to this CD for months. I heard one of the songs on the NEW AGE satellite channel and thought I'd give the CD a chance. The entire CD is awesome. The music reminds me of Enigma, Deep Forest, and Medicine Woman (except no fruity bird sounds). Sure enough, as I checked out some stuff about Kevin Wood, it said his influences were: Enya, Patrick O'Hearn, Deep Forest, Sacred Spirit, Enigma, and George Winston. If you like the sounds of those musicians, you'll love this CD. The piano pieces are exceptional and every song has a good rhythm/beat. If you take a chance, ENJOY+music
if not for us eccentric music fans it would be totally forgotten+P+What a shame. Such a good debut album yet no one even knows who they are. Jay Ferguson is one of the luckiest or most talented artists. He achieved success in 3 forms (Spirit, Jo Jo and Thunder Island solo). This is a great, gritty, greasy, soulful southern rock album.   I would like to see a modern band do a cover so as to resurrect this quality band. How about Metalica doing Run, run run?+music
A Happy Sacrifice+P+I gladly sacrificed two of the four speakers in my car to this wonderful, wonderful treasure. What more can I say+music
I Wish Dylan Were Young Today+P+My favorite song on this record is "Subterranean Homesick Blues." I keep picturing that video in my mind of a very young Bob Dylan, flipping those cards to the beat of this song. "115th Dream" is another song with those great lyrics that only Dylan can write. He is certainly a poet, there is no denying that. I Love it's Alright, Ma." But every time I hear the version on this early record, my ears subconsciously hear all the the applause that you hear erupting during the live version on "Before the Flood" when Dylan shouts out, "Sometimes even the President of the United States must have to stand naked." That song worked then. It works now. We need a young troubador to help us find our way in these troubled times. But, I suppose nobody listened then, so I guess they wouldn't listen now. Still, I'd like a young Dylan today raging against all the injustice that abounds+music
TALENTED+P+I'M FROM FLORIDA AND DIDN'T KNOW WE HAD THAT MUCH TALENT HERE. IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE I BOUGHT A ALBUM THAT I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE I HAD SPENT 15 TO 20 DOLLARS TO HERE 1 SONG THAT I LIKED. I ROCKED T-PAIN'S ALBUM FROM BEGINNING TO END. RAPPA TERNT SANGA PROVES THE U DON'T HAVE TO STEAL, KILL, SELL DRUGS, HAVE SEX, OR BE THUGED OUT IN EVER SONG TO INTEREST PEOPLE. . .+music
Probably the most stimulating relaxation CD I've ever heard+N+Points for the concept, but this CD kept me awake!  The crashing waves are loud and distracting, even on low volume, and the music frankly a little depressing.  I actually found myself getting agitated listening to it.  Then again, I had some of the worst nights' sleep ever during a vacation in Belize in which I camped on the beach for a week.  Oddly enough, Gibson's Ocean Sounds works better for me, probably because there the waves are gently washing up on shore rather than smacking into rocks.  If you are used to ocean sounds then Natural Sleep Inducement may work for you, but if you're landlocked like me you may not find it as helpful+music
I'll give it half a star...+N+this CD Deserves 1/2 a Star Because i did enjoy whipping it out the window of my car into a nearby bicyclist....It was pretty funny.  Otherwise this record was worthless+music
Funk Is on the Rise!+P+I have been reading some of the reviews online for this CD and I am wondering for the P-Funk haters with the state of black music on the radio what do you people expect? I like this double CD because George was going for the old & new sound of today's overproduced and water down sound.The songs I really liked were "Bounce 2 This" a funk jam for the ages,"Inhale Slow","Never Ending Love","Su,Su,Su","Something Stank","Viagra","Paradigm","Gyspy Woman","Whole Lotta Shakin",and "Goodnight Sweetheart,Goodnight".There were some songs I didn't care for songs like "I Can Dance" which went on for too long and "Butt-a-Butt".I wish Mr. Clinton would brought some of his trademark characters to this CD:Sir Nose,Starchild,Dr.Funkenstein,the monkey,The Horny Horns,etc.In short,this is a very good album better than the pervious P-Funk albums in the 90's.This CD is a good start+music
Reviews less than 5 just don't get it...+P+Ever walk around, read the newspaper, watch TV, and basically see so mch stupid stuff that it takes all your willpower not to go off and bash everything? Thankfully, Black doesn't care whose feelings get hurt, so we're all benefitting from it. Hilarious stuff, man..+music
sick boy?+N+is this a cover of Social D's sick boy?  and if youre looking for a good album, get one of theirs+music
At Last was disappointment +N+Turns out I purchased this cd for one song.  I was very disappointed with the rest of the cd.  The song At Last is wonderful but one song is not worth the price of the entire cd+music
SAID IT BEFORE AND I'LL SAY IT AGIN'+P+If you've never bought a Country CD in your life, Make this your first. It is haunting. I defy anyone to play this just once. I always repeat it at least 3 times.    The Man is the most potent proof that one can reveal the age of one's soul through his music. As flat & shallow as the most electronically plumped pop crap on the so called country charts today, is Hank Williams III deep. Next to III, His Father may as well be a fat drunk in a seedy karaoke bar. This young man does his Grandpa proud & them some. He seems possessed of the spirit without having to struggle to invent an identity of his own like his father before him to step out of big Hank's shadow. III steps into the shadow and lights it up like a state fair on the 4th of July. It is all there. It has skipped a generation but it is in the marrow of his bones. In fact he's a damn good living argument for re-incarnation if you ask me. Haunting is a word that is in my mind every time I play my copy of one of his albums. But this isn't for someone looking for a fair impression of Grandpa as his father once did. I myself find myself listening to III then putting on a bit of Grandpa & after a few songs I'm hungry for this all together new phenomenon. The dimensions he reveals & the music he creates in doing so. It's not old fashioned country, nor rockabilly, punk, rock or anything that I think can be pigeon holed. It is as new a form as the bop with which Charlie Parker once rocked the Jazz world. Hank III's versatility is beyond description. Surrounding himself with a posse of daredevil side men who are as hot, versatile & inventive as he, Hank III will have you banging on the Internet for more discs & cursing his woebegone label for holding him back. So talented & so obviously deep a well of humanity is this young man that it would come as no surprise to me if someone, someday mined a great acting ability from that well. The distant mournful look in his eyes within the innocent childlike face belies any image of less to which any reviewer of poorer soul may point.   He is at once, dark, mournful, childishly cocky, sexy, raw & miscieveouly playful. He has a facet for every emotion a listener can possibly need expressed through music. You will put him on when you're blue and end up cheered, you will put him on for a good time & end up haunted long after the album has reached it's end. He comes across as the kind of guy with whom any fun loving man would like to roll one, go out & get plastered & any woman would want to hole up for a stormy few days in shack with a guitar & couple of bottles of J.D.   I pray he can get by & be happy without ever selling out to the industry & falling into the same crap mold of all the big Nashville/Hollywood stars who pass for country artists today. Listen to this Boy & every country record, tape or cd you own that isn't his, his Grandfather's or Patsy Cline's will gather a thick layer of dust before you put them in a giveaway box where they belong. He will surely leave you with an allergy to sequins sharp black suits and Grammy winning, bleached white teeth.   There was Hank Williams & There is HANK WILLIAMS III. Don't need nobody else & if ya do, you must have a tin ear, shallow life, black heart and a deep dark hole where your soul oughtta be.   Hank Williams JR. -- Do yourself a favor old man & retire. He has come -- no thanks to you!+music
One Of My Favorite Hip-Hop Albums..+P+I love this album.. every track fits perfectly.. this is good hip-hop the way that it's supposed to be done. I don't know which track I would consider my favorite since overall I like every one but I would say that the beat to T.R.O.Y is just plain out awesome one of my favorites of all time. If you want some hip-hop look no further check this out.   You will not be disapointed.   Justi+music
Pete Rock & CL Smooth+P+This is a very enjoyable hip-hop album that was a breath of fresh air when it sppeared. Although it lacks a super-duper classic tune, it is strong on 90 percent of the songs. The only problem for the artists who recorded the album is, it is so good, there isn't anything else to say at the end. How can Pete Rock and CL Smooth do any better? This is their 'Invisible Man' so it did not shock me that they did not record much after the release of this gem. CL Smooth appears to improvise at times on this album and doesn't sound rehearsed (much rap does). Pete Rock's beats are superb. Don't waste your money on sex rap or crime rap; get this one, and learn+music
KIDZ BOP MUST DIE!!!!!!!!!!!+N+Who keeps coming out with these CD's? Who is crazy, stupid, retarted, and idiotic enough to make so many Kidz Bops!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? They KILLED My Immortal which is my absolute FAVORITE song that was ever written on the face of this earth!!!!!!!! The adult who sings the leads on Toxic sounds like somebody's grandmother being eaten by giant mutated brocolli. I'm serious--and I don't even like Britney Spears. Who is buying this crap?  THE TERROR MUST STOP!!!!!!!!!!!!+music
A Little Country, But Still a Rocker+P+What a change for Bob Dylan. First he was a folk singer, than a hard rocker and now it seems he'd turned direction, going a bit country. However, don't make any mistake, just because he's got country musicians, this is still a rocker and it's one of my top five favorite Dylan records. "John Wesley Harding" is sort of a western ballad that will have you stamping your feet. "As I Went Out One Morning" is a country rocker with a message. So are many of the other songs on this record+music
Classic album -- TERRIBLE remastering+N+First of all, I want to make clear that I think this is a phenomenal, 5-star album.  This review is for the remastered edition of the cd only.  If you already have the original cd release of this, hold on to it.  That one has problems, but it at least sounds true to the original album.  This remaster is an atrocity.  The drums dominate the mix (sorry Cozy -- I don't love you THAT much), while the vocals float in the background.  Worst of all, you have to strain to hear the guitar in many parts, with the synthesizer far more prominent.  Whoever remixed this is an idiot.  Evidently, they think that Ritchie Blackmore was the LEAST important person in this band.  I assume that most Rainbow fans would disagree--with no disrespect to the rest of this legendary lineup.  Rainbow Rising is classic rock for people who enjoy guitar, not nu-metal for people who want to demo their subwoofers.  It should have been mixed that way.  Beyond the sound of it, all these Rainbow remastered re-issues are a rip-off in every other way, as well.  No liner notes.  No lyrics.  No bonus tracks (not even the inclusion of "Jealous Lover" with Difficult to Cure, which was on a cd single at the time of the album's release).  These re-issues are the worst I've seen from any band.  Compare them to the Deep Purple anniversary remasters and it becomes obvious how much more could have been done with these.  In my opinion, this is an insult to the diehard fans who are purchasing these releases for the third or fourth time (lp, first cd release, Japan import cd, and newly "remastered" version).  If you don't have this yet, you should buy any version you can find as quickly as possible, because you've been missing out.  But for anyone who already has a previous release of this cd, you should just save your money+music
Musically Fit+P+As a musician, I find &quot;Not Guilty&quot; to be of a very high standard, musically. Calvin Rodgers is awesome and unmatched on the drums. The musicians kept the Groove in the pocket. This is a very professionally done project and it is an example of a &quot;More excellent way&quot; of ministering the Gospel in today's world.I listen to the CD daily. Who said that we cannot play Jazz, R&amp;B, Rap, Hip Hop etc etc? Yes, &quot;IT'S POSSIBLE&quot; but the difference here is The Anointing; Lyrics to point folks to Jesus, and Music, saturated with the God kinda vibe played in the vernacular of the man on the street. Pastor Kee, you are a trend setter. Keep up the good work. So Folks, go out there and purchase a copy today. It will change your life+music
Boring! +N+The first song is okay... the rest are incredible boring. This album is completely unoriginal. I regret buying it.+music
An ozzy osbourne rippoff, don't buy+N+Have U heard "let's go" from from this poser who thinks nobody has ever heard crazy train from ozzy osbourne? He completely killed a really cool part of that song and replaced a really hardcore song with somthing dumb like "Let's Go!!!!!" and other dumb rhymes. I never understood why rap did this. Think of me as white heavy metal trash if U want but at least heavy metal people play guitar and rappers use mics and rap about things nobody cares about. Heavy metal people are experienced with their fingers while rappers like Trick Daddy use their palms (think about that for a minute) now if U like trick daddy I have no problem with that. I would also have no problem if they did a cover for crazy train from ozzy but I get pissed if they start ripping off giutar riffs from him. I'm more of a heavy metal type of guy but I like SOME rap. Listen to Eminem, Ludicris, or Lil'John if U wanna hear some rap with original Ideas+music
Bad Title, Good Music+N+Although I do not agree with the message this CD is trying to get across, I will say the music is great. I think Rock Stars/Celebrities should quit pushing their views on easily persuaded 16 year olds who think of Rock stars as idols. It seems people in this world don't make up their own mind anymore, instead they are manipulated by the "Loud-Mouth Minority." Get your facts straight, but in the meantime, enjoy the great music. 2 stars for good music, missing 3 stars for the stupid message they are pushing forward+music
A great performance+P+I have a very special care for this Vivaldi's work.  Somehow, life has made me aware of many forms of interpretation of this very concert. Yesterday I was listening to it and I was aware of some details that made me look for it.  I simply knew that the director was asking for wonderful new sounds that are not often to be found in the average performance of this masterwork.  Often, my favourite version is the one of "I Musici". Yet I wasn't too surprised to find it was Osawa the conducer of this amazing version.  I had had the chance of listening to previous works by him and I realize how he manages to make a classical always present.  If he is the director of this record, no doubt, it is worthwile+music
Relation to other comments+P+A few points about the bad reviews sitting in here...  Master Shake shurrup you should be slapped about the room!!!  Mathew Braxmeier --- Generic Emo??? I bet you have never listened to Emo in your life man... Clueless Whiner!!! And as for a title lenght... What would you preffer? Something short n catchy for you like 'Wannabe' By the Spicegirls??? Did you buy the album or just search for sum bands you probably knew you wouldnt like so that u could moan about em???  And as for Jane Doe --- HHHMMMM there is the 'old favourite' Nirvana... WOW that would be amazing for sumbody to not like Nirvana thesedays... Granted they did write a few good songs... Heck even spawned Foo Fighters after the death but jesus samuel christ!!! Ive yet to meet sumbody thats not in love with them...  And before you sit there and say... Aw i bet he hasnt heard anything other than smells like teen spirit and come as you are... Wrong! I have every album... I just choose not to listen to them to fall under the typical Category of Anotherone who goes with the crowd...  As for Black Flag, Sex Pistols and The misfits... Wow a little bit of taste from someone who has yet to have a little bit of variation in her taste!!! Move with the times Jane... All great bands in their time just as Fall Out is a brilliant band of this time!!!  Every song just as catchy as the next with this album... Yet to hear how they can sound the same as AFI, Greenday or Panic!  Anyone who wants to whine send them my way... Im sure Jane will i noticed the only 2 reviews were complete and utter moans...   Buy this album... It is sheer genius!!!  At the same time check out these bands guys...  - Hoobastank (New album out) - Jimmy Eat World - Stiff Little Fingers (Amazing Punk band from late 70's still going at the moment and touring soon) - Flogging Molly (Irish Punk) - Three Days Grace - American Hi-Fi (New Album) - Yellowcard (Amazin Band) - Papa Roach (Still Going Strong) - Panic! At The Disco - 3 Doors Dow+music
R&B singer or Rapper+N+I've been down for Monica since the beginning; but now I am FINISHED, I love Monica's voice, but whats up with all these singers wanting to be rappers...WTF!!! I want the soulfoul Monica from the first CD, "Sideline Ho" ARE YOU SERIOUS!!! again WTF!! Could someone please come out with a soulful mature CD, cause this one aint even close.+music
Barry ManiLOW...real low.........+N+How did this guy ever get a recording contract? Not only is his singing style shmaltzy, but his voice is grating, whiney, and nasally. Besides being a self-admitted atheist and homosexual, he is a terrible singer. Very handsome, though. He looks like a cross between a giant mosquito and a Kangaroo who got into somebody's eye shadow and makeup kits. What an overrated wierdo. This guy had to have friends inside the industry. Manilow singing Tony Bennett or Bobby Darin is akin to Cedric the Entertainer playing Cary Grant or Clark Gable. In drag, no less+music
"Hits" the Spot+P+"Hits" is a collection of 16 songs from Phil Collins solo career, from 1981-1998. I'm a big fan of Genesis (both Phil Collins' and Peter Gabriel's), and Phil's "Groovy Kind of Love" was playing on the way home on my first day of school, so I'll always have a soft spot for this collection, and though it's missing and has room for a couple of the hits I would have liked (like "Don't Lose My Number") I have gone through a couple of copies of this one.  Phil really has a warmth and honesty to his love songs that's pretty unique. His earthy voice, matched with the particular production he prefers, captures and evokes the 1980s pretty well too. That's not to say he's just 1980s ballads. He also sings of contemporary issues like in "Another Day In Paradise" and "Both Sides of the Story", and does interesting descriptions of character in songs like "In The Air Tonight" and "Take Me Home". There's a good mix of all that here. Phil's voice can get pretty powerful, on "I Wish It Could Rain Down" for intance. He'd come a long way from quietly singing "For Absent Friends" (one of his first recorded songs, featured on the 1971 Genesis album "Nursery Cryme").  He's a great drummer too, always had been, and even then he's not afraid to play around with a drum machine, which were seen to some as a bit threatening in the 1980s, from what I've read.  The bonus track on "Hits" is a version of Cyndi Lauper's "True Colours", with some backing vocals by Babyface. It's pretty laid back, fits in with the hits, and I'm glad to have it. The booklet folds out into a mini-poster with the vague impressions of his solo album covers (as painted on this CD art) on it. On the other side, there are credits for all the songs, which were interesting. I had no idea both Sting and Phil's old friend Peter Gabriel do backup vocals of "Take Me Home", and I wouldn't have known unless I read it here.  There's a 2 CD Phil Collins compilation out there called "Love Songs", and while there's some good tracks, and some interesting bonus and live stuff on it, it's all slower and sentimental, and doesn't really show off Phil's versatility as well as "Hits". Plus, with this compilation, there are songs from soundtracks and non-Phil Collins albums (like "Buster", "Chinese Wall", etc) that you won't have to go hunting round for, as they're all here in one place.  Genesis' "Turn it On Again: The Hits" would go well with this one, as it has Phil's other hits like "Invisble Touch", "I Can't Dance" and "Follow You, Follow Me". Recommended. Four and a half stars+music
Major Let Down+N+I really enjoyed the first two books albums, I bought Thought for Food almost immediately after the Lemon of Pink because I enjoyed it so much. I found their sound to be quite original with an interesting balance of emotion and humor along with the balance between electronic and acoustic music. So I was really disappointed when I heard their new album. This record is clearly intended to be their breakthrough, with far more vocals and regular song structure and less expirementalism. The record even reuses some samples from old albums which was really annoying. This album lacks the interesting, unexpected twists from their previous works, and as a result comes off as generally bland and sometimes even cheesy. If you want a Books album, please check out the other two first+music
false information!  said new, but wasnt+N+they said the cd was new. that it was still in its shrink wrap and everything. instead, they sent me an old, delaphadated and used cd.  it had many scratches on it, and one of the tracks wouldnt even play+music
Hello Mediocre+N+I've been a Beastie Boys fan since I was in 8 years old. I played the cassette version of License to Ill until it did nothing but make a squealing sound in my head phones. And until a while ago I would maintain to anyone that EVERY Beastie Boys album was great, cool in its own right and an evolutionary step forward by some of hip hop's most talented artists. (Get to the point. I know, I know.) But I had never really owned "Hello Nasty' myself. It was the only one of their albums I hadn't picked upon release. Until recently.  Now, upon closer inspection reveals that there really isn't a stand out track on the whole album. "Intergalactic," "Body Movin'" and "Super Disco Breakin'" may have been pseudo hits but they don't really stand out from the rest of the album, which feels like mostly filler. Decent filler, though. There are a few stinkers: "Song for the Man" (It's cool when they try to do new things and the lyrics are interesting, but this track is utterly skippable) and Dedication (following House of Pain's shout out track lead is indulgent and just plain boring to listen to).  Like their previous two LPs, there are a few decent instrumental track that break up the album. But in general the whole album seems to pass unnoticed. I listened to it 4 times in a row while at work an couldn't really discern any standout track. But for what it's worth, I wasn't annoyed.   All in all it's cool to hear the B-Boys make a cohesive album with a unique sound, but it's not mind blowing. I'd recommend it for serious fans and people collecting all their CDs. It's certainly won't detract from your collection and there will be a time you'll want to listen to it. But I wouldn't expect to find yourself picking it over Paul's Boutique, Check Your Head or even To The 5 Boroughs (awesome, by the way) for that matter.+music
Just 'cause you're in a movie doesn't mean you're great singers+N+The Cheetah girls are so full of themselves. I recommend the Cheetahs girls to 5- year olds+music
And then he composed himself...+N+Let me start off by saying that after extensive therapy, I feel that I'm finally able to write this review.  I've been reading some of the other comments on this board and all I can say is that I've never been an advocate of hindering people's right to free speech...until now.  I just got finished listening to Jeffery Gaines's version of In Your Eyes and I have two burning questions that just won't go away.  First of all, where is it that the other contributors to this board buy their smoke?  And secondly, why didn't Mr. Gaines just cover Peter Gabriel in gasoline, strike a match, and call it even?  On the other hand, I must agree with a few of these people on one point: this version of In Your Eyes evokes emotions in me I never thought I had the capacity to realize.  I honestly can't say I blame anyone who finds their eyes welling up with tears when confronted with this towering monument to mediocrity--I had the same experience myself.  And as for those wisened souls who feel this version has some measure of value and, in fact, &quot;blows Peter Gabriel's version out of the water,&quot; here's a thought for you to tax your proton-sized brains over: a nuclear bomb can blow many things out of the water, but that doesn't make it a good thing to inflict on innocent people.  But if, after considering this, you still arrive at your original conclusion, there's only one course of action I can self-respectingly recommend. Take your own life.  Do it now before it's too late+music
This band was so far ahead of it's time . . .+P+that you will discover them very soon - buy this disc!  Seriously, I had vinyl of both of these releases in college and as CD's took over replaced my vinyl with this.  It's pure psychedelic power pop done right, combining sing along hook happy elements of the Beatles, ethereal layered guitar work with background electronics that really put it "out there".  Front man Mitch Easter of course played a hand in putting REM at the forefront of college radio and it's unfortunate that his excellent work with Let's Active never really made it into the mainstream consciousness.  Those who have heard it know.  Buy this, love it, and then move on to Big Plans for Everybody+music
All garbage doesn't sell+N+In today's rap market the hot commodities are the albums that have the most materialism, disrespect to women, and "gangsta fairytales". Well Shawnna's album has all of the above and her sales are poor. So what does that say for Shawnna. She can't even sell in a market that caters to commercial BS!!!!!! This album is garbage, Shawnna is chi-town garbage and needs to find a new occupation. I suggest her finding either the nearest strip club (since she is from the chi I suggest Arnie's in Harvey!) or find the nearest porn studio for a more productive career+music
IMPRESSIVE+P+This is a very good dance album with amazing lyrics and beats! i remeber when i first saw the "Dancing Queen" video on Disney Channel when i was in 5th grade and i was truly captivated by them! AND THIS IS AN AMAZING DANCE ALBUM for the fisrt 7 songs  My Favorite songs  Mamma Mia (Gimmie Gimmie Gimmie) a man after midnight Super Trouper One of Us Voulez-Vouz S.O.S  1.Mamma Mia-10/10  2.(Gimmie Gimmie Gimmie) a man after midnight-I LOVE this song it is just one of the most amazing songs to dance to.10/10  3.Super Trouper-AWWW this is sucha sweet song with dance- i LOVE the beat.10/10  4.One of Us-GREAT lyricz 9/10  5.Voulez Vouz- a really great song to dance to, with amazing beats and rythms, My 2ns favorite song on this album  6.S.O.S-REALLY GOOD 10/10  7.Dancing Queen- THIS WAS MY ULTIMATE FAVORITE SONG EVER(back then) now i dont think its all that great, but i still love the video.  After these seven songs the album just gets pretty lame. BUT TRUST ME- THESE SONGS ARE WORTH IT  Final Grade-9/10    +music
Open your ears, people.+N+This record blowz. The tunes last forever -- one verse after another, same crap melody over and over, no drama, no nothing except the old ennui, which I guess is what appeals to some folks. And Lenny couldn't manage to sing in tune for more than three consecutive notes. He's improved somewhat over the years, but you all really need too look up from your "Fleurs de Mal" once in awhile. Poetry is poetry, music is music, and while Leonard's poetry may speak to you, his music sucks+music
White Bread Christmas? Indeed.......+N+I've always thought of Diana Krall as a sellout. I've been told that she was not a singer by choice, that record execs saw dollar signs and "encouraged" this mediocre pianist to sing. They were lucky that Krall has a nice voice quality and sings in tune, and can swing in a very middle of the road, 2 levels above white bread kind of way. But as a performer, she comes off as an emotionless robot. Her overall delivery is a droning monotone. Every song is performed the same way, in a husky, lilting, and ultimately boring as hell manner.  Since Norah Jones has effectively blown Krall out of the water in terms of sales, what could they think of as a comeback? How bout a Christmas album! Nothing says sellout like Christmas. And I actually like some of those songs, but to be honest, I'd rather sit around and sing them with my friends than listen to Krall sleepwalk through this set of traditional tunes. In fact, I'd rather go Christmas Caroling in the Gaza Strip than listen to this unimaginative, boring, lifeless collection of performances.  OK, maybe I'm being too harsh. But once a tool, always a tool. Krall is too much part of the machine, so if she did have an original idea, I doubt there would be anyone in the company that would let her try it.  Some the arrangements on this disc have nice orchestration, but overall sound very functional, commercial, and bland. Which fit perfectly with Krall's bland delivery. Even when she tries to emote on Mel Torme's great composition " The Christmas Song", it sounds disingenuine.  I think of Diana Krall as a product. When a business school grad goes to work at a corporation, they come in with profit as their goal. So whatever product they want to market and sell to the American public, and hopefully the World market, they want to have the most widespread appeal possible. Diana Krall is the Coca Cola Sugar Water of music. Sugary Sweet, a buxom blond with very little nutrition or substance in her artistry. But the vast public wants a CD, i mean, product, that they can put on at a dinner party and basically talk over and say, " We love jazz! Here's our Diana Krall CD." Diana's pose on the front cover says it all. Pretty and all dressed up but just lays there lifeless. It's almost a pose of defeat. Even sellouts have their limits+music
Barbara Cook Disappoints+N+I was very disappointed in this CD.  I like her and have been a fan for years.  I think the piano accompaniment didn't do her justice either.  I listened to half and couldn't be bothered to finish the rest.  I was so disappointed, especially since I had read such good reviews of it+music
DIS ALBOOM RULEZ!!!!!!!!!!!!+N+DIS ALBOOM IZ SOOO HAWT AND SEXI!!! CHINGY IZ DA BOMB!!! PLZ BUY DIS!!! ITZ ON MTV SO IT MUST RULE!!! CHINGY IZ DA BESTEST RAPPER EVA AND HIS MUSIK IZ SO AWSUM TAT IT MAKES MEE SCREAM!!! MEDAL MUZIK LIKE IRIN MAYDON AND SIPULTORA SUK EXCEPT LIMP BIZCIT AND LINKIN PARK!!! OMG CHINGY RULEZ!!!                                          All of that was untrue! Chingy sucks and he's the worst rapper ever!  P.S. Iron Maiden and Sepultura are amazing and Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park suck+music
It sucks man,but rap is dying out like Basic Cable +N+Rappers like this piece of S***,him and Nelly,all that southern bull is the reason rap is flockin,one of theese days 50 and Ja are gonna end up like big n pac.What i do is,i be honest is i listen to rap and rock,also thats played out if you want to wath thoose new bands and there videos watch Fuse,but anyway i may be  laughed at n S*** but i listen to rap from the 90's and the early 2000's cause there aint jack S*** out there but bubble Gum M.C.,s.Anyway lets get back to Chingy,the only good major release he has is that Jackpot BullS***.Plus his F***** style is annoying he sounds like a chipmunk on Helium. Anyway if you like underground rap go cop some music from Aesop Rock,Murs,Wordsworth,MF Doom,but please avoid this S*** at any cause.   P.S. HAPPY NEW YEAR 2006!!!!!!!!!!!!+music
the first review/kagemusha+P+well, this is the first time for a review, and i was recomended to this review. so here it goes.First of all wow!!! i mean wooow what a score, Bear McCreary did a hell of a job on this project.  Its like a mix of all kinds of composers , like Harry Gregson Williams( from Man on Fire), Halo lot of cue`s, i could go on, and ofcause a danish group called Safri Duo.  If anyone of your guys and girls like this kind of sumption , then buy it now+music
Prince's Hip Hop Revolution+P+We had already seen an album with Hip Hop infleunts on "Diamonds and Pearls" from 1991, this album from 1992 commonly called The Symbol or just Prince & The Power Generation is the album where it eventually sounds like a band performing together, and not a semi-solo album like "Diamonds". They also go one level further with even more hip hop sound then on any other album.  "My Name is Prince" samples his old song "I Wanna Be Your Lover" among others in the beginning, the song itself is a catchy hip hop infleunted song with both raps and samples. Prince also raps here and he's loud as even before. With lyrics such as "My name is Prince and I am funky,My name is Prince the one and only" it may sound ego-centric but with all the things he's done and experienced he got the right to.   "Sexy M.F" was a song that the radio didn't want to play cause of it's explicit lyrics and (title aswell). On MTV is became a massive hit but it was highly censored. It feaurures guitars and classic horns. "Love 2 the 9's" is a middle paced slow jam, still with hip hop sound though. "Morning Papers" is anothe ballad, but more relaxed. Great lyrics like "If he poured his heart into a glass, And offered it like wine ,She could drink and be back in time for the morning papers". "The Max" is a funky hip hopish number where NPG show it's potential. "Blue Light" is a slow paced song with reggae sound somehow. "Eye Wanna Melt With U" Is also funky explicit song about sex. "Sweet Baby" is the opposite, a very emotional ballad about love.  "Continental" is a up-tempo song with horns where NPG once again show what they got. "Damn U" is a slow trendy ballad. "Arrogance" is only 1.35, and sound more like a funny number then anything serious. "The Flow" is also a funky song that feaurueres horns, pretty typical for this album. "7" was one of the biggest hits from this album, a middle tempo odd number that does't really fit in here. "All 7 and we'll watch them fall, They stand in the way of love, and we will smoke them all, With an intellect and a savoir-faire" It's aparently about a man from the bible that will never grow old. Ditto with "And God Created Woman", a beautiful ballad perfectly suited for a Prince album. "3 Chains of Gold" is midtempo mini-opera that goes on for over 6 minutes, it's part soulish falsetto and part guitar solo's. Very Unique. "Sacrifice of Victor" is a funky song that portrait Prince as a civil rights activist and goes back discussing the riots after Martin Luther King Jr's death.  Overall, this album is much more focused then the last one and here most songs are either funky hip hop sounding ot smooth ballds. It doesn't feel like a solo album anymore and NPG get's much more space then on any other album. The lyrics are exceptionally on point here and the rock opera on "3 Chains of Gold" is one not to miss. Although it was messy There were more natural hit singles in "Diamonds" though and this "Symbol" album get's a little repetitive at times, on the other hand it's proves that Prince was able to melt into the early 90's hip hop revolution and do it with class. 4/+music
Waste of money+N+I was very eager to buy this CD. I have the CD Elixir and I love it. I saw and heard fourplay in Atlanta and they were awesome. However, this CD has too much computerized music. Too many sythensized voices. Very predictable. In my estimation, a bunch of tracks to play on smooth jazz radio stations or in an elevator as mindless filler. I didn't care for this one at all+music
A DREAM WORTH WAITING FOR+P+A dream is what your heart makes. And for years we've been dreaming and wishing that Cinderella would make a comeback. And thanks to the magic of Disney, our wish has been granted. (Please do not mix up this Cinderella with the punk-rock band of the same name. This is music; that is a mess.) We are happy to see (and hear) that extra tracks, including two demo recordings. And though we understand Disney's marketing techniques, we do wish that the added performances by Jim Brickman and Kimberely Locke would go away. Maybe if we close our eyes real tight and chant those three magic words. All together now: bibbidi-bobbidi-boo ..+music
Murs is top notch.+P+When your drowning in the world of trendy, here today, gone tomorrow rappers... Murs is a breath of fresh air.  I like every track on this album, as well as 3:16.  Usually I pick up an album, like a few tracks, and listen to the dope tracks and that's it.  I wish it were a little longer, or contained a few more tracks.   Still a dope album though+music
POMPOUS, SELF INDULGENT DRIVEL!+N+Just like the Beatles, Led Zeppelin in most peoples eyes can do no wrong. Sorry they can and this along with 'in through the outdoor' is a band so full of self importance that they can serve up drivel like this and go platinum. I mean if any other band served up psuedo raggae(d'yer maker), a funk James Brown catastrophe (the crunge), half finished songs (dancing days, the ocean)and a complete mish mash of ideas (song remains the same) it would be career suicide, not Zeppelin though. I find their arrogance on this quite breathtaking. Sure 'no quater' and 'over the hills' are great, but Jesus doesn't Plants warblings and hippy drippy lyrics grate after a while. Mind you he never was that great when compared with say Paul Rogers or Ian Gillan. The only saving grace with this is one of the greatest cover designs ever+music
Classic *****+P+a perfect album. start to finish. i don't know what more to say. 5 stars for Neko+music
Dick needs to get some....+P+I was laughing hysterically when I read Dicks review of John Lennon, I looked at the other things he reviewed - aprox. 10 albums, and he was bitching about them all, gave them all one star, so the only albums he reviewed were the ones he disliked....oh yeah except for the BEEGEE's, he likes them. lol So forget peace and love and understanding- its all jive talking. +music
Inner thoughts from a hollow man.+N+Imagine no possessions?  Fine, then you get rid of your jewel encrusted luxury palaces.  Imagine no religion?  Fine, if religion's such a "crutch", then you forsake your million dollar drug habit.  Imagine no countries?  Fine, then you move from England or America to Africa or El Salvador.  The world will be as one?  Fine, then you act like an adult and don't abandon your wife and child when they need you the most.  John Lennon was a text book phony.  He was a grown-up with a child's brain who ordered the rest of us to live a life that he wouldn't.  Maybe if he didn't squander his days snorting cocaine through one hundred dollar bills he would have recognized how utterly ridiculous he sounded.....then and now.  The utopian dreams of the 60's are history, and they were destroyed by none other than Lennon himself-an unscrupulous fantasy peddler who selfishly preyed upon the optimism of a generation.  His blatant hypocrisy was so obnoxious that the very thought of his music makes my stomach turn.  Thank you very much.  -DW. +music
Fun listen... more fun the second time, even more fun after that!+P+I'm a recording engineer by trade.  I sit in little rooms with no windows and big speakers listening to the same song for 15 hour stretches for weeks in a row.  Every now and again a record will roll through that is actually fun to make.  This sounds like one of those recordings.  Whether or not the players took this seriously or not will only be known to them and the production team, but the presentation comes across as if it was just a bunch of talented friends hanging around a studio and having some fun making music.    With a great cover version of one of my absolute favorite Hank songs, the album might have been able to leave one or two songs in the can... but rip the album to an iPod and those songs can be the right breath of fresh air as you're driving.  The audio quality and production decisions of the recording should also be noted.  Yeah, there are some notes of questionable tuning but the their presentation is so believable the record would not have been served if those notes had been corrected.  Matt Marinelli captured the sounds with perfection, and didn't over process or manipulate it later [or so it seems!!].  The record works for me in a big way and I for one am exceptionally happy to own a copy of this recording [a client for whom I'm going to start a project in a few months sent me the copy as a kind of template for the way he'd like his project to come out... if we get 1/2 way there then that is going to be one damn fun project!!]+music
great Cd+P+I bought this CD for my grandson and he just loves it. I enjoyed it too. Just loved all of Trace Adkins music on the CD+music
A few good bands but WAY to much emo/screamo+N+This is an okay compilation however its far from the best. If your looking for good punk music you wont find much of it here. Heres a list of the bands i thought were pretty good  The Offspring  Pennywise  Strung Out  Strike Anywhere  MxPx  Millencoln  No Use For A Name  Street Dogs  Plain White T's  I really hate emo music, And it's not like a really really hate all screamo/hardcore music its just that i really don't wanna hear like 40 songs in arow of it it almost sounds the same.  Hopfully next year there will be some more punkish bands on the tour such as Propagandhi, Nofx, Desendendents,Pennywise, Rise Against, Black Flag, Anti-Flag...et+music
Classic Soundtrack+P+This soundtrack is a mix.  My favorite songs are some of the prototype 80's tracks: Danger Zone, Mighty Wings, & Through the Fire.  But it also has some great oldies like Dock of the Bay & Great Balls of Fire.  If you haven't seen this movie yet then go out and rent it.  Then pick up a copy of the soundtrack+music
50 Times And Counting...+P+I have owned this CD since the day it came out and I have not stopped listening to it.  I like all rap and hip-hop for the most part.  I love lyric, social driven rap like The Roots and Talib Kweli and Mos Def, but I also have no problem throwing crunk club ish in the deck like Three Six Mafia or Lil' Jon.  That said, this album completely blows me away and it seriously pains me that Obie Trice is so slept on.  This album is better than Second Round's On Me, most likely because he had more help from Em on this one truthfully, but still, both CDs are great.  I just wanted to write this review to do something to try to spread the word.  This CD is unbelievable.  My three favorite rap CDs of all time are the Notorious BIG- Life After Death, Eminem- The Eminem Show, & Obie Trice- Cheers.  I love the female-problem-driven songs on here like Lady, Hands On Me, & even Don't Come Down about his mama.  The lyrics are unreal and his style is unprecedented and fresh.  He is creative, witty, and his flow is downright cold, not to mention production is superb.  Please buy this CD+music
Get Down With Da Goblin+P+Profondo Rosso is probably Goblin's finest hour in the soundtrack department, though I think many would debate that Suspiria and Zombi might be a little better.  I won't go into the music, coz I can't imagine someone buying this cd who's unfamiliar with the film and the music from the film.  You do get your money's worth, this sucker is 72 minutes long.  My only complaint with this, and all the other Goblin soundtracks is that there are about eight billion different versions of the same song.  I know people like this, but to me it gets a little irritating.  The alternate versions aren't really all that different from one another(with a few exceptions)-at least not different enough to want to hear the song again when you just heard it one or two tracks ago.  I mean, do we really need that many versions of the lullaby song?  But on the other hand, I do respect the fact that Cinevox went out of their way to make this as complete as possible.  And considering you have to take out a loan to pay for these soundtracks, it doesn't seem so bad in the end.  What it really comes down to is-If you like the music when you watch the film, then you'll like this cd+music
ewwww....+N+I honestly hate Kidz Bop. I mean, Avril Lavigne is my favorite singer, and My Happy Ending is too good of a song to be wrecked by Kidz Bop. I mean, I sing in the shower better then these kids! Don't buy it. Borrow it from the library if you must.+music
The Duke Meets The Earl+N+I bought this album on pure speculation it was an Amazon recommondation and was uncharted waters for me. Owning around 200 blues albums with close to 100 of them being lps. I had never listened to either of these guys. Read the reviews and seemed like it would be a good venture. Received my cd figuring it would be like most blues albums and would take several listens before it would start throwing its arms around me. Wrong! This is one of the few albums I own that nails you right out of the box! It has been in my car stereo for around a month now and shows no indication of getting old.The first three tracks are non stop adrenalin guitar work with number three at just over 15 minutes just being a total piece of work. Smooth like a well aged whiskey. The final track with guest singer is one of the more haunting blues pieces I've ever heard. It's one of the few pieces I know that actually brings you to the edge of reverse blues and makes you feel bad this track is also in the 15 minute time slot too. All and all you can just let this cd run and it becomes nice back gound music to what ever it is you are doing. All in the way classical music does. I'd be surpised if any one really listening to this could give a bad rap! This is a real guitar players record+music
AWESOME!+P+BUY THIS ALBUM! Seriously, this is one amazing cd. Every single song on this cd is worthy of your purchase. I promise you will not be dissapointed+music
So Good +P+Man, this is a great record it moves and grooves and just suits you like a long motorcycle drive or a nice fitting glove.  Just kidding I don't ride motorcycles, but this music just makes me dance crazy with a pocketful full of soul.  It can't be helped how it revs the motor of your mind to jump on a motorcycle but the music is your engine, moving along the road and laughing the whole way cause the ride's fast and nothing stops it till you crash or run out of gas+music
It takes a while...+P+I grew up on Dylan... in fact, Dylan is my middle name.  I was very intimate with his songs from a very early age.  When I bought this album in the early '90s, I was still in high school.  At first, I remember thinking that his voice was gone.  I didn't think I could listen to the entire album.  I struggled through it and put it on a shelf.    From time to time, I forced myself to listen to it.  I don't know exactly when the change took place... I suppose I grew up a bit, musically.  Good As I Been To You started to take shape.  The guitar... the harp... the voice.  All of a sudden, it meant something entirely different.  It made sense.  It all came together.    Now, fourteen years later, I listen to this album at least once a week.  I will not hesitate to say that this is a great album.  But, for some reason, it needs to grow on you.  It builds up to some subtle crescendo.  Then, suddenly, it will hit you like a ton of bricks.  Dylan knew exactly what he was doing.  This is his re-entry into greatness after a few years astray.  The guitar picking is incredible.  His voice couldn't be more appropriate for the content.  If you need more proof, just look at what the (rare) vinyl form of this album can fetch.  I recently acquired the LP, and it is the most expensive one in my collection!  Those 'in the know' really know what this album is worth.  Give it a try... then try it again.  Let the guitar flow through you for a while.  Sing along.  Go ahead and try.  It's not that easy.  You'll soom see why this IS one of Dylan's greatest albums.  I say that as a hard-core Dylan fan, so don't take it lightly+music
Stunning...  Sheer intangible musical brilliance+P+I bought this album because of the opening track, "The Hollow," which, after listening to it online, I felt as if it was the most incredibly melodic rock song I've heard in a long time.  I also thought Maynard's voice sounded absolutely amazing on that song.    So I went out a bought the album about an hour ago, literally!  Every song is amazing!  Even though many of the songs are heavy, they have this highly ambient melodic feel to them, especially with Billy Howerdel's and Troy Van Leeuwen's guitar playing, which really shine all the way through on the album.  They use some very interesting guitar effects for virtually every song.    In any event, whether you are a fan of Tool or not, a fan of Maynard's or not, BUY THIS ALBUM!  I'll admit, I'm a fan of Tool, no doubt, especially the albums "Aenima," and "Lateralus," which both have some of the most incredible progressive metal music on them, but I almost like this band better.  I like the fact that APC is just about as heavy as Tool, more melodic, have a more polished sound, are more experimental and progressive (in my opinion) than most of what I've heard from Tool.  This is not to discredit Tool's work, of course, whose music has already been etched in the alms of metal and hard rock history, it is just to say that APC is another alternative.  Whether or not this is a "side project" of Maynard's or not, it does not matter to me, the band and album is flipping amazing in every which way!  FAVORITE SONGS: "THE HOLLOW," "ORESTES," and "3 Libras".  +music
Jesse in CA+P+Unbelievable songwriting! How could TJW go relatively unnoticed as he has been in the music industry? I just saw him in Los Angeles last week in a smaller venue and he tore the roof off the place!!! Just him, his Stratocaster & harmonica and a drummer. With the PA system set up right he sounded like a 5-piece band with just the 2 of them! One Hot July is probably his best effort to date in my opinion and now I'm currently in the process of purchasing everything he's ever put out!!! Buy this album and experience some of the best music ever produced+music
A baby band...................+N+The CARS were one of the most annoying, dumb, pathetic, lame, overrated, stupid, lousy, and awful bands ever came out in the 70's. Their lead singer RIC OCASEK sings horribly and sings like a baby. This greatest-hits album was a huge joke that each and every song is incredibly bad.  Their guitar playing is really bad. They are only recommended for loosers. Don't listen to the five star reviewers of this album and avoid CD's from the Cars, Nirvana, and AC/DC who suck. Listen to good bands like Foreigner and Dire Straits insted. ps.the cars are for babies!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!+music
Tropical Jazz+P+There are some great songs on this cd. Club Paradiso,&quot;Be Cool,Love Child,I Found Heaven,and the title track are my favs. It's smooth jazz with a tropical twist. Be Cool stars Dave Koz another one of my favorite smooth jazz artists+music
sorry Latinosoulboy ,U GOT IT WRONG+N+this is whats wrong with most of the smooth jazz genre.lame mechanical tracks thrown over a bed of programmed drums.Its time to get REAL and play it that way!!!!!+music
Great album+P+This is one of my most favorite Commissioned albums ever. Reason being is because Fred and Marvin are great singers and this was the last project they had together before their solo careers really took flight. I love this album, "Dare to Believe" is a classic. "I'm Learning" is one of my all-time favorites. "Love Is The Way" and "Come Home" are two blazing, bumping tracks that will get you bobbing your head. Then the album goes urban praise and worship on the last few tracks which is uplifting and spiritual. "Draw Me Nearer" is, vocally, Commissioned at its best. Another one to add to the collection+music
A Timeless and Smooth New Order Album+P+Of all the New Order albums that I own, I would have to say that Republic has been my favorite throughout the years. I enjoy listening to this album the whole way through, and with the order that they used to lay out the songs, you can have it on repeat and want to listen to it again and again.   So you can understand my interpretation of the feel of the album and why I like it, I will tell you that I enjoy this album because of the musical style it has, which in my opinion, has a timeless and smooth quality to it. Each song starts out brilliantly, and although it would go well on a pop radio station, it seems a little more mature and unique than your typical pop tune, using a fine combination of guitars, keyboards, and at times, a choir and a symphony. To describe the feel of each song, as each song progresses, you become more settled as the rythm and the background (almost a classical style-like music) resonates and blends with the guitars and keyboards even more as the song reaches it's climax. Bernard Sumner's vocals seemed to be most at home with this style. With Coldplay, Dido, Sarah McLachlan, Delerium, Balligomingo, and many others in my most frequently listened to category, this one definitely goes well in the mix... the mix for chillin. :+music
Wow.,  This stuns me in its mediocracy+N+This is truly one of the worst Goth and related genre compilations I have ever heard.  With the PARTIAL Exception of disk # 2, the songs chosen of even the best bands were among their worst or most mundane songs. It almost seems as if someone was given a list of bands and their songs and said 'pick songs to go on this album' they put up a list of songs up on a board and picked them by randomly throwing darts at it.  Great bands on disk 1, but again they picked some of the more mundane songs overall from Bauhaus, Legendary Pink Dots, Die Form, Christian Death (Disk 4) and some of the more classic favorites. Again- on disk 2 which showed the most promise for other than the utterly mundane they had poor song choices- for example they chose 'Drool' for Switchblade Symphony (which is a band I truly adore otherwise) which is one of their least impressive and mundane songs. Though they made it clear by the intro this was not just 'goth' music, but supposed to encompass Industrial and Darkwave as well, I was stunned at how little Gothic and Darkwave music there really was- and was perplexed as to why they bothered putting metal-related bands on like Two Witches and several others on the compilation. A few good songs scattered on disk 2 and 3, but why pay for 4 disks of music with some to a few good songs on each, when everything worth listening to could have just gone on 1 album? Hours of boredom listening for a few gems.  For a good compilation I would recommend the Goth Box and the Disease of Lady Madeline+music
Fun in Small Doses+N+AFI's debut album is a great deal different from their last few CDs.  There is no traces of Goth or pop punk here, just straight up old school punk with some truly hilarious lyrics.  The problem with this album is it's all the same, there's almost no variation, so it's good when you listen to just a few tracks (all of which are good) but put back to back it's impossible to get through the entire CD without a headache.  The two standout tracks for me are "High School Football Hero" and the Classic "I Want a Mohawk but My Mom Won't Let Me Get One". The music reminds me alot of MxPx's debut CD "Pokinatcha", but the lyrics are alot more similar to the Offspring.  Definitely a good CD if you wanna see where the band started and you're already a fan, but if you're new to AFI and want to backtrack from Sing the Sorrow or Decemberunderground I recomend either Black Sails in the Sunset or the All Hallows EP instead+music
Maybe even 5 stars+P+I have now retracted an earlier negative review. I have played it since and enjoyed it. I was overly critical. I do play it and enjoy it.  (ONE AND ONLY LOVE ALBUM) REALLY DOES BLOW THIS ONE AWAY THOUGH AND I PLAY IT ALL THE TIME (100 STARS)+music
continued brilliance+P+Whenever anyone lists Joe's best albums, this one always appears at the top of any list.  It really is amazing, with some of Joe's signature work, not the least of which is Summer Song, which has sort of become his anthem.  This is a powerful song that rocks nonstop.  The title track gets down in it, and the song Friends carries such an optimistic feel to it.  Joe is the master at delivering a message without saying a single word.  His guitar does the speaking for him, and it speaks beautifully.  War and Motorcycle Driver are another couple of hard rockers.  Cryin' is easy and more contemplative, and Rubina's Blue Sky Happiness sounds like a courtship song, something to be played on a warm spring day with your sweetie.  I'm not sure what the name The Extremist means, but if it involves Joe's mastery of the electric guitar, then the title sure fits him. +music
girly chick lit+N+god forbid i be so bold as to trash a classic.  and yes, maybe because of all the raving reviews from my friends and from the book's great reputation, i entered it with high expectations. - which the book however did not satisfy.  yes, it is a good comedic parody of the upper class of the time, a lampoon of the courtship ritual, and of course oh so witty, blah blah blah, but it just wasn't my cup of tea.  the main character was likeable, but that aside, i found it completely insufferable to read through, and absolutely painfully boring.  every subsequent event from the very beginning could be predicted, let alone the ending.  not that anything really ever happens - the entire book could be summed up with, "then they walked and talked and had tea and walked and talked and had tea, walked and talked and had more tea, then got married and lived happily ever after."  the entire novel was a headache of girly gossip and mental drama.  it would save more time just to watch a chick flick.  so if you're interested in the relationship fiascos of fictious characters, witnessing the agony over who's going to marry who (even though the reader could already predict the happily-ever-after match-making light-years in advance), then this is the book for you!!  if not, then i suggest picking up some dan brown.           +music
Alan Jackson Precious Memories CD+P+The is a wonderful collection of hymns.  Alan should do more acoustic work. Glad his mother was finally able to get him to cut the CD.  Sang most of the songs while growing up in El Paso.  Already liked Alan but this collection of songs shows he is blessed with talent.    Have bought 2 of these to share with family members.  My aunt who just turned 99, thought it was great. +music
Listen First+N+I wish I could have found a snippit of each song when deciding whether or not to purchase this album. Instead I relied upon the other reviews and my memory of 'Take On Me' and 'The Living Daylights' from when I was younger.  I decided to take a chance and purchase this album.  I listened to the album once and have no real desire to hear it again.  The music/lyrics stink (unless the listener considers hearing about broken relationships and lack of commitment to other people and oneself enjoyable).  I would definitely listen to any of Ah-Ha's albums/songs prior to deciding whether or not to purchase them+music
Great+P+Mirman's humor is an acquired taste, but once you acquire that taste, you will keep coming back and reveling in its deliciousness over and over again.  The problem with Eugene lies mostly in the fact that you have to appreciate utter absurdity in order to enjoy him.  I can enjoy it and I love the album.  Take a sample, if you like one bit, take the whole thing. Otherwise, wait awhile, Mirman needs time to truly live up to his potential which he gives us a peak at in "Florida" and "Shapes for Sale." +music
Should a comedy album feature pity laughter?+N+Do you remember the guy in high school or college who tried to be the class clown but failed miserably? Well, Eugene Mirman is less entertaining than that guy.  I'm not being sarcastic about the pity laughter... that's the most laughter here, and yes, this was recorded live. How the record company heard this and still felt comfortable releasing it is beyond me. Perhaps it's a tax write-off+music
A classic?+N+This just furthers my argument even more. Just because an album is more than 10 years old by a "legendary" group doesn'tmean that it's good or even a classic. This is classh** at its finest. I actually owned this album at one point when I was young and stupid. But i wasn't that stupid cause I got rid of it quick. You mean to tell me this album is derived from true creativity from ones heart. Lyrics that mean somethin. Thats what hip hop is all about and this is not a hip hop album. There is nothin creative about this album at all. Its a dance album for freaks. Now if you lookin at this from that point of view, then I guess this is a 5 star album. But for someone to call this a hip hop classic you have no idea what a hip hop classic is. You just don't. Damn can the state of hip hop be so f***ed up when anything by 2 LIve Crew can be considered worth owning, let alone being called a classic? If you give this 5 stars,then trash garbage rappers the likes of Chingy, Nelly, Trina, Khia, Camron, DFB, D4L. then your the biggest hypocrite typing reviews on amazon. 2 Live Crew in my opinion, lyrically is in the top 5 of the worst rappers in history. And they are just as one dimensional as your most hated rapper. If you don't believe me just scope out ALL their album covers and song titles. And ask yourself can you really call these bums artist. Seriously I cant get it through my head why somebody over the age of 18 would actually by this s***. I just cant+music
What the game's been missin?  Not you +N+Maybe it's just me and I'm expecting so much when I spend my money or a little bit of time listenin' to these new n*ggas. But I'm just not feelin' this s*it here. I fell asleep mid way through this album. I just can't seem to understand why these n*ggas is so one dimesional. I cant underdstand why people still supportin' these n*ggas. Not one track was tolerable. If dis cd belonged to me i would threw this s*it away already. Word of advice dont buy this.+music
Such a Let Down+N+I write from the perspective of a life-long fan. This was one of the first modern bands that I loved and I followed their every release from my preteen years onward. They seemed to never miss the mark creatively or sonically, and the increasingly strong imagination and coherence behind each record was only matched by the increasingly complex production. But on this release, they seem to have run out of ideas and melodies and passion. That hurts to say, but it is painfully true. I'll accept this as their auto-pilot record. The reason I give it two stars is because it makes me appreciate Yoshimi, an album I initially viewed as a disappointment in the shadow of the Soft Bulletin, as a proper album (albiet a lateral move)+music
What happend to the BTNH we used to know? +N+I love Bone, but you gotta admit this album is terrible. Bad beats, bad rhymes the whole nine yards. It seems like Bone went from Thug to Corny and thats coming from a true Bone fan. A truly wack CD put out by one of the best rap groups of all time.+music
Hey, Where's Crispy Critters?+N+No true CW MCCALL fan should stoop to buying any collection that would omit the classic singer/songwtiter/rapper's most seminal work!  Looks like I'll have to pass on this one and be satisfied with CW McCall's Greatest hits.  What a disappointment+music
Best Song Cycle Ever Written!+P+I believe that this is the best song cycle ever written and remains as one of my favourite Guettel pieces. The songs on this CD are extraordinary, extremely well written and cleverly assembled. I have also bought the sheet music which confirms his musical genius even further and also contains many songs not on the CD such as Prometheus, Jesus the Might Conquerer, Life is But a Dream and Build a Bridge, all of which are fabulous. This is a must for all music lovers! You won't regret it+music
they've finally dissapointed me+N+i feel like crying right now, literally.   i suppose that i saw this coming, even though i'd give anything to avoid it: the goo goo dolls have straight up sold out, and no other band could dissapoint me more than they could.  the goo goo dolls were the sole band that brought me through my teens, and probably had the single most early influence on my taste in music. no other band had the intensity, musically and emotionally, that these guys captured on their earlier albums (albums like jed, hold me up, superstar carwash, or a boy named goo for all of you who started with dizzy). the complete lack of words to describe the feeling a certain song gives you-- you know what i'm talking about- these guys had it in everything they did. had it, past tense.  their progression that critics tote as "maturing," alas, was the dolls slow descent into what they've become now. we (longtime fans) saw it and silently groaned to ourselves, not able to admit to ourselves that it was happening. it started with dizzy up the girl (with what, for or five singles? get serious). don't get me wrong, i enjoy that album, but only because it still has some of the magic that made the goo goo dolls what they were. the songs still felt real. gutterflower was the real omen; but at least the songs were still somewhat interesting, musically.  and so it comes to this, another great band ruining itself. trust me, i tried desperately to like this cd. desperately. but it doesn't feel real. the lyrics are cheesy. the musicianship is way below par (as compard to their creative ability and talent). the songs are forgetable and all sound the same. the only song i found somewhat enjoyable was "listen." (the only taste of real ggd i could find on this cd). (and only two songs with robby on vocals? its a shame. his raspy voice is beautiful.)  its hurts me immensely to say these things about john and robby. they've been my idols for more than half of my life. it feels like a part of me is dead. sounds cheesy, but the ggd have never dissapointed me. time to face up to the facts: they finally have. i guess all good things come to an end.  so if you want to hear some good music, go to the used cd store and pick up superstar carwash, and hear what this really great band used to sound like.+music
For What It's Worth+P+What a combination!  Releasing a soundtrack that would pit traditional southern critics of bluegrass against rabid White Stripes fans from Detroit!  I'm sure that Jack White isn't the only performer who is delighted with the controversy this album generated.  Musicians just love the music......it's the critics who need to take a hike.  This is a great album that showcases BOTH great traditional bluegrass AND well known rock musicians displaying a love of the human feeling that is embodied in bluegrass.  So.....quitcherbitchin and enjoy it for what it is.....a nice soundtrack to a movie that showcases bluegrass for a wide popular audience+music
I'm flying over+P+I love the last Five Years so much and so when this came out I got it immeadiately.  The song Over is so great I listened to it Over and Over (no pun intended)  I thnk no one does a ballad like Jason and I highly recommend the whole albu+music
Indie Masterpiece+P+There is no doubt that I would rate this as one of the best abums of the 80's and Sonic Youth's best abum. However, if you are not a Sonic Youth fan already, I would steer you to their olater albums first. This album is very atmosphereic. It changes moods from mellow and pensive to raging guitar riffs. It has an almost purposeful low-fi sound (think of early albums from Dinosaur Jr. or Guided by Voices). If you are not into experimental, indie rock, go to Sonic Youth's later albums like "Goo" or "Dirty". They are more accessible. ( I wouldnt say that they compromise integrity though) However, if you are a music explorer; someone who likes bands like radiohead, there is a reason that Sonic Youth are considered the godfathers(with apologies to Kim Gordon, the female bassist) of underground music. I defy you to talk to a person who loves indie rock who does not love this band, and particularly this album.+music
Love Letter+P+Stars - Set Yourself on Fire 5 out of 5 Stars  To take a cue from the great single that never was," Elevator Love Letter", from Stars' last under heard/appreciated release, Heart.  I humbly submit my love letter to Stars' latest magnum opus, Set Yourself on Fire:  Dear Set Yourself on Fire,  You've got some nerve, coming into my life under the pretense of eletronica and then making me feel something so strong. You grew on me. The last time I felt this way was when I first fell for The Beautiful South. Your interplay of male/female parts by singers Amy Millan and Torquil Campbell is unparalleled now. From the stunning propulsion on your namesake track through the cinematic sensuality of "The First Five Times", I feel you.  I know I've only known you for a few months, but I feel like we've been together much longer. I have a massive crush on you. You're all chill songs, goose bumps and couch dancing fun. You glide into the room with "Your Ex Lover is Dead, but your hopeful closing refrain ("Calendar Girl") is "I'm alive!" It's sadly beautiful.  You're an album, a collection of songs that come together to form something greater. Taken alone, your songs are great ("Ageless Beauty" and "Reunion"), but together they are unstoppable. Our time together is precious, there's no wasting it with any clunkers. You're listenable all the way through, good for driving, headphones, partying and maybe later...making out? It's inspiring, tragic, and heart warming. Your strings and horns are hot and the piano, harmonies and glockenspiel are your prettiest eyes. I'm riding this rollercoaster of mood swings, dancing and tempo shifts. "I am trying to say what I want to say without having to say..." Dare I say love, during wartime? It's 2005 and we're alive. You're the reason I listen to and look forward to new music. You're my payoff. What are you doing on Saturday?   --- Jeff Kami+music
Fun and Catchy!+P+People, honestly, who cares if Franz Ferdinand is today's best band or if this album is "funky" or not. This album is just good ol' fun music that's not at all watered down or lackluster. Just listen to this album and dance to it. Not every critical acclaimed album has to be a masterpiece.+music
A miserable, mopey masquerade+N+Someone here says "alot of indie snobs love Deerhoof". That's correct, and that pretty much speaks volumes. Here's another band with hip vintage equipment, boring song structures, alot of connections, and nothing to say. As if there weren't enough of these bands out there. Absolutely nothing of consequence is going on here: it basically boils down to a phenomenal waste of human and natural resources to make this band's CDs and release them to their 30 or so fans (mostly indie rock CD store clerks). It is also a waste of your time, and mine, giving them another moment of thought.  Extra points docked for the worst band name ever+music
Disappointed+N+As a long time Beach Boys fan who is in his 50's, I was rooting for Brian Wilson to pull this off.  Unfortunately, this is a very mediocre album and in places really grates on me.  My wife made me take it out of the player in the car.  "Good Vibrations" and "Heroes and Villains" realize the potential of the 60's versions and shine as the albums best cuts.  Most of the rest of the album is unlistenable.  It is Pet Sounds progressing to the next level (not a good thing) and almost sounds like a Pink Floyd "Dark Side of the Moon" wanna be, only 35 years too late, and not as listenable+music
THIS IS THE ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK!!!+P+Don't listen to the other reviewers this IS the original soundtrack for the film when Harry Met Sally.  Buy it and enjoy it+music
The Renaissance of Modern Music+P+Jazz, R&B, Rock, Soul, Funk, and Pop music had all existed before 1982, but when this album came out, it literally combined all the elements and paved the way for what music is today. From recordings to performances to worldwide sales and recognition, Jackson set the standards for it all. Hundreds of years from now, this will still be looked back on as quite possibly one of the finest albums ever recorded.  While Quincy maintained his masterful touch on all the recordings, Jackson lent his to the timeless compositions of "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'", "Beat It", and "Billie Jean", songs that have literally become signature songs of the 1980s, and showed the world just how musical Michael could be. Aside from those recordings, master songwriter Rod Temperton ("Rock with You", "Off the Wall", "Always and Forever") and R&B soulman James Ingram contributed their own unique tracks, as well. From "Thriller" to "P.Y.T.", every song here literally changed the course of music as a whole.  While some have maintained that there are far better albums in music history's catalogue, I have yet to come across any with as much quality, energy, diversity, and versatility as this one. A masterpiece+music
Great single, just NOT a great album+N+Most upsetting about PORT OF MIAMI is that being a big fan of the organ-filled "Hustlin'", I was hoping that quality-wise the entire album would stand up to that brilliant for single. Unfortunate for the somewhat fortunate debut (#1 on the Billboard 200 with 187,000 copies sold), the album to put it bluntly stinks.  Sure "Hustlin'" along with a generic repeat of Young Jeezy's massive "Soul Survivor" hit ("Cross The Line" which features nobody else by Konvikt Akon), are fine, but otherwise, Ross has more inhabitions than attributes.  While idealy Ross should compete with new standouts such as Southern rapper Young Jeezy or T.I., or even more less known names such as Slim Thug or Bun B, he doesn't make the cut against any of those artist. In fact, Ross's gravely vocals tend to grate rather than inspire, all except on the opening tracks such as the above par "Push It", "Hustlin'", "Cross The Line", or "I'm Bad".  Otherwise, Ross unfortunately falls on death ears.  It makes you wonder that if Ross were to ever release a sophomore album, would it be successful?  With such boasts made of him by Diddy and Jay-Z, mega hip-hop stars and talent-searchers, you wonder who dropped the ball with the excution of this star's album, which is terrible to say about any new artist.  And without a true single tall enough to stand against the incredible but minor radio cut (it never did really well despite fan support) "Hustlin'", you wonder if after an impressive debut and support if the only way for Ross is down instead of up?    No, I'm not putting Ross down, but I can't help but to say that I was expecting a meatier, Grammy worthy debut from Ross instead of the rather hit-absent PORT OF MIAMI.  Does he rep good for Miami? Sure, but hopefully a second round will make Ross more mature and more likeable than a rather bland debut.  2 stars for the album, 4.5 for killer single "Hustlin'", a sure to be rap classic+music
Omarion's Review+P+OMG When I heard he was comin got with an album after the whole B2K break-up, I was surprised as hell!. I brought it and love every single song except for "Never Gonna Let You Go" I dont like that song really. I love the album coming from a true B2K fan i thought it was gonna be like the same ol' B2K stuff but with 1 person but I was really surprised. He really matured on this album and I love it. Love You O   +music
buy Kelly's album instead of this+N+I never got through listening to this whole album... I bought it because I was a fan of Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guarini - but just hearing the first few minutes of Kelly's version of Respect, I lost interest.  I don't recall ever putting the cd in the cd player after that time. So if you like Kelly and Justin, buy their albums instead+music
Would the real Sting please stand up?+N+Is it just me, or do all Sting's new songs these days sound basically the same?  I've loved Sting's quirky, compelling - and not infrequently erudite - songwriting and music-making as far back as I can remember, from early Police through to 'Ten Summoner's Tales' - but every time I listen to one of the newer albums, I just get a feeling of wading through formless aural goo that refuses to coalesce into anything resembling a distinctive voice or vision.  I don't WANT Sting to make Part 2 of 'Turtles' or 'Summoner' (artists have to evolve and explore to be worth listening to) but I miss the clever playfulness of 'Englishman' or 'Heavy Cloud', the sombre poetry and sweeping thematic unity of the whole 'Soul Cages' album and the heartbreaking simplicity of 'Fragile' or 'Fields of Gold' - I miss the way the music and words *worked* together, and the way there was always one more thing lurking below the surface if you listened carefully enough, or a cleverer musical joke than you'd initially caught.    The point is, 'Sacred Love', 'Brand New Day' - and even 'Mercury Falling' - could have been made by ANYONE - there just isn't anything that separates these songs (okay, except maybe 'Desert Rose' and 'Thousand Years') from easy listening elevator music, nothing that makes them Sting's and not just another faceless product that exists mainly as background to a slickly edited music video.  Even the outrage seems carefully calibrated -'This War' is certainly no 'Russians' (even discounting the brilliantly quoted Prokofiev theme), and the extra verbiage is neither forceful nor intelligent enough to induce me to actually listen, as opposed to letting it play in the background.    On the plus side, I am looking forward to getting hold of the new album of Elizabethan songs - Sting certainly has the musical smarts to take on such a challenge, and I'm keen to see how he handles the delivery of the music.  But I'll still miss the old Sting - the one who could make me dive into a book to check a reference while simultaneously making music that always had something new to offer - and I'll continue to live in hope+music
The most loathsome song ever.+N+I don't listen to the radio much. In fact, it would be closer to the truth to say that I actively AVOID listening to the radio, whenever possible. But it seems that no matter where I go, I can't escape the constant airplay of Green Day's megahit "Boulevard of Broken Dreams."  I don't hate this song because it has a bland, repetitive structure, or because of the band's lackluster musical talents, or Billie Joe's grating vocals. Those are all valid reasons to hate "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" but my reason is my own: The lyrical content. Let's take a look, shall we?  "I walk a lonely road The only one that I have ever known"  Yeah, sure, whatever you say. Not only does Billie Joe have a wife of nearly twelve years, he also has numerous friends and MILLIONS of adoring fans throughout the world and was voted "Sexiest Rock Star" by Kerrang!, and suddenly he's telling me how lonely he is? He's probably never experienced one moment of true loneliness in his whole life! What kind of hypocrisy is this? The whole song is nothing but Billie Joe whining about how he walks alone and how he wishes "someone out there will find me" which comes out painfully contrived and insincere.  "Oh, you're overreacting," you say. Well, maybe I am. But the truth is, I am violently sick of bands churning out shallow, meaningless drivel with some mopey lyrics to try to make money off of people's misery; and it's not just Green Day, either. Bands like Linkin Park, Evanescence, Good Charlotte, Simple Plan, and many others all seem to be hooked on trying to parlay their so-called "loneliness" into their albums not because they really feel such emotions and wish to honestly express them, but because it sells albums.  Misery isn't trendy. Songs like this and countless others aim for your pocketbook by pretending to "feel your pain." These hacks aren't worth a dime+music
this is WACK it deserves no stars+N+I would like to know what type of people are writing these reviews and what state of musical knowledge they have i've never written a review but after reading what these plutocrates have wrote i have to respond this cd is on par with Ant and Dec its terrible she waffles on with an annoying high piched voice about english mcs sounding american then she tries to sound like a cracked out missy elliot who also is terrible she has absolutely zero talent and im amazed she has a record deal its borders on treason that shes allowed to hold a mi+music
oh+N+cocorosie sucks.  They can't sing.  And they really piss me off using the N word in their Jesus Loves Me song. +music
Over engineered fluff+N+BeBe and CeCe demonstrate great comprimise in this sad collection of &quot;gospel&quot; songs because almost every cut can also be interpreted as a secular love song.  Unlike a true gospel artist like Vickie Winans,  who has the ability to evangalize through her music, these performers seem  to be embarrassed about being inspirational.  This disc is for the bubble  gum Christian, not for the listener who takes his or her faith seriously+music
Lovely Lila!!!+P+Lila Downs is by far the most amazing vocalist of our time. I have all her CD's and can't wait until the next.  Her music and live shows are inspiring and moving.  She's a Latina who keeps it real and is proud of who she is, where she comes from and where she's been. I had the honor of meeting her and her inner beauty surely compliments her outer beauty.  Her talent is moving, and her humility inspiring.  I recommend this CD 100% as well as all her others.  Hear it for yourself... and catch her live performances when she's in your town+music
Best Punk Compilation Ever? I Beg To Differ!  ):&lt;+N+Let's get one thing strait: I am deffidently not a punk hater, and DEFFIDENTLY not an mtv loser fan. In fact, punk rock is my favorite type of music. But I did not like punk o rama volume 5. I just did not find it cool, catchy, or even ok. It sucked. The only songs I really liked were the Pennywise song and the Vision song(which is about being close minded, and I don't like people who are close minded), and the Pulley song was okay, though the singer's voice annoys the heck outta me. The rest is bland, unoriginal, and annoying. Even the Rancid song was annoing. Yes, you heard me right. Everyone's so-called favorite punk band's song was annoying. At Borders, I had the choice between this and AFI's All Hollows E.P. I now know better than that. If you liked this CD, fine. Just remember to buy good punk CDs from bands like The Distillers, Misfits, The Ramones, Offspring, Rise Against, and early AFI, out of respect for good punk+music
Hope you're feeling better...+P+This is the Santana &quot;best of&quot; for people who don't need a collection of songs that can be heard on any classic rock station within minutes of tuning in. The deeper tracks from Abraxus included here are more than worth while+music
A shoddy monument to a great artist's 80th year.+N+Five stars for the music but reduced to one star for content and value.    Value???  At around $135 this box set to mark Tony Bennett's 80th birthday year is obviously aimed at the hardcore Bennett fan / collector, rather than at the casual buyer.  With that in mind one is left wondering what exactly it was that Sony/Columbia thought they were giving to us that was so special?  What we have ended up with is a frustratingly mixed bag.  Firstly, the packaging.    The picture on Amazon seems to be an early mock up of the set, as the finished product is more elaborate.  The box is a cube covered in black velour with Bennett's signature embossed into the top.  The front of the box has a perspex panel with a pencil portrait of the singer.  Behind this is a montage of miniature album covers and photos, set slightly back from the panel to give a 3D effect.  Above this on the top front surface of the box is a small silver metallic plate with Bennett's signature.    In the base of the box is a ribbon tag which when pulled reveals a small, hard backed book of approximately 60 pages, again covered in black velour with another small silver metallic plate featuring the singer's signature.  Contents of the book are a collection of charcoal and pencil sketches by the singer and a collection of brief (and I do mean brief) hand-written personal comments on the albums included in the set.  All very nice, but as a fan of the music I would have prefered recording information, anectdotes about the original album releases, session details, etc.      At approximately 7.5" x 7.5" x 7.5", the box will be an awkward if not impossible fit on the shelf beside the rest of your CDs.  OK - so what about what we really came here for, namely, the music?  This is where the above mentioned frustration comes in.  Let's take it album by album.  First of all there are several already available CDs, but in digitally remastered form, some with and some without bonus tracks.  These are:  I Left My Heart In San Francisco - No bonus cuts but significantly improved sound quality over the previous release.   The Art of Excellence - No bonus cuts but significantly improved sound quality over the previous release.   Perfectly Frank - No bonus cuts but significantly improved sound quality over the previous release.   MTV Unplugged - Two bonus cuts ("Just a Little Street Where Old Friends Meet" / "When Will the Bells Ring for Me?") and  slightly improved sound quality over the previous release.  The Movie Songs - Two bonus cuts ("A Time for Love" / "The Shining Sea") and slightly improved sound quality over the previous release.  Then we have a selection of albums that come under the banner of "pointless" as they have already been available for some time, already previously remastered:  Cloud Seven - Same as the previous release with no noticeable difference in sound quality.  The Beat of My Heart - Same as the previous release with no noticeable difference in sound quality.  If I Ruled the World: Songs for the Jet Set - Same as the previous release with no noticeable difference in sound quality.  The Tony Bennett / Bill Evans Album - An even more puzzling inclusion.  Not a Columbia release, but recorded for the Fantasy label in the '70s.  This is the original Fantasy CD release, not even repackaged for the box set by Columbia.  It's just as if they bought a bunch of these from Fantasy and popped them into this collection.  However, and again frustratingly, this is NOT the 20 Bit remastered edition of this CD that has been available for several years but the non-remastered, sonically inferior release from the late '90s.  Perhaps Fantasy had a few thousand of these that they couldn't get rid of because they had been superseded by the remastered edition and unloaded them on Sony/Columbia?  Whatever the reason this is a slipshod inclusion in the set, to say the least.  Next is one album already previously released and remastered, but here in a slightly amended form.  I Wanna Be Around - No noticeable difference in sound quality, but with different bonus cuts from the previous release.  The previous CD release of this album included as a bonus, seven tracks from the "This Is All I Ask" album, a somewhat bizzarre and half-baked addition, as all of the  tracks from "This Is All I Ask" would have fitted on to the disc making a two-on-one release.  For the box set release we have three different bonus tracks "If I Love Again" (alternate take) / "Someone To Love" (alternate take) / "Indian Summer".  So - if you want all of the bonus material you have to hold on to your (now deleted) previous CD release of this album.  The next album again comes under the heading of totally pointless:  The Singles Collection - considering this box set is aimed at the hardcore Bennett fan and not the casual buyer (casual buyers don't drop $135 on a whim), another "Greatest Hits" variant is completely pointless.  Something tells me that the people likely to be forking over their hard-earned moolah for this box will already have everything on this disc, probably several times over.  Heaven forbid Sony/Columbia should have given the fans something so outrageous as a disc of rare and unreleased tracks instead of this, their umpteenth hits compilation.   Finally, two albums that finally deliver the goods for the fans.  Tony Bennett Sings for Two - Briefly available on CD many years ago but rapidly withdrawn for some reason.  This remastered version offers significant improvement in sound quality over the previous release.  When Lights are Low - first time ever relese anywhere in the world on CD (so far as I can ascertain).  An absolute gem.  More of this type of album -i.e. never before available on CD- is what this collection needed.  So - what do we have at the end of the day for the Bennett faithful?  One previously unavaiable on CD release and one long unavailable on CD album,  three albums in exactly the same form they are already avaiable in,  one album in an inferior version to what is already available, one album with different bonus cuts to its previous release, five albums with remastered sound (two with bonus cuts) and, finally, one totally pointless "hits" collection.    Considering that approximately thirty Tony Bennett albums have never had a CD release, many more are long deleted on the format and bearing in mind the considerable amount of unreleased material in the vaults, this collection is a completely botched undertaking, a missed opportunity and a pretty shoddy commemoration of the man's 80th birthday.  Just exactly who executive producer Danny Bennett and Sony/Columbia are aiming this box set at is a bit of a mystery.  If it is the dedicated fan, then I have to tell all parties involved in this release that we expect a lot more than two unavailable albums, a collection of already avaialble cleaned up recordings and seven -count'em folks- previously unavailable tracks for our $135.  Just what are the chances, I wonder, of Tony Bennett's back catalogue making it to CD before his original fanbase -or for that matter his newer devotees- are all in their graves?   This is a sorry monument to a great artist's 80th year.  (AFTERTHOUGHT: I'm still puzzled over the unusual number of discs in the set, namely, thirteen.  Not a dozen, not twenty. but thirteen.  Go figure.  You know what they say about the number 13 - "...unlucky for some...".  In this case the unlucky ones are Mr Bennett's fans.)                 +music
Petra doesn't want to grow up+N+Although Petra has a sweet voice, I felt her songs sounded juvenile and scattered.+music
Seperating the Tracks Would Have Been Nice!+N+I never really noticed the soundtrack when watching this show on television but I love the show so was a little surprised when purchasing the album that all the non sound bite tracks are American country music songs. Can't say I'm much of a fan of American country music so was just a bit disappointed. I think a great inclusion on this album though is the sound bites from all the leading housewife characters on this show and this alone is worth the price of the CD.   Was also disappointed that Danny Elfman's Desperate Housewives Theme is not a separate track and ridiculously has some hidden track attached to it. The Desperate Housewives Theme goes for 0:44 seconds then you have a break of silence for a while but still on the same track before at 1:01 a terribly sung summary of the TV show mentioning Wisteria Lane over and over again follows for a minute and twenty seconds. What ligic was there in not making this a separate track? You would then be able to memory it out on your stereo. I like listening to TV themes and I find this just ruins that track because you need to be near your stereo to press skip after 0:44 seconds. This CD is worth purchasing for the sound bites alone but I guess if you're just buying it for the theme song you'll have to wait for some other new TV theme compilation album to get the theme song on its own.   This album also comes with an excellent cover insert booklet with lots of great pictures of characters and scenes from the show.+music
I love the Legacy version+P+I am one of the people who got the album when it originally came out.  I had it memorized.  When it first came out on CD, I was disapoointed.  I had noticed that quite a bit of it was cut, especially the bit he talks about before the VSM.   However, when I found that the Legacy CD came out.  I had to buy it.  Boy, I have not been disappointed.  It is great.  It is even better because they have added some songs that were not even on the original CD. +music
Enjoying It+P+This is the kind of CD that you don't skip over any tracks on. You can't help but to knod your head and tap your fingers to each beat and imagine being in a small intimate venue hearing the songs being played live.  Most of the songs are kind of fast. Great driving CD.  Favorite Tracks: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 11 and you gotta love track 13 (also on his previous CD). +music
All Hype+N+I bought this album because I am so into Sigur Ros at the moment and it seems all the reviews I read say that "...if you like Sigur Ros you will like MBV.." Let me say this album is no where near a Sigur Ros experience. If  I could compare them to anyone it would be very early Cocteau Twins , though I must be clear I don't think the singer is anywhere close to the artistic sense and vocal talent of Elizabeth Fraser. It would be more palatable if the production value was higher....it sounds terrible. The sound quality is comparable to some old VHS tapes I have from the mid 80's that I recorded off the TV ( Then soaked in water for a few days!) .+music
Overpriced+N+WOW. 12 dollars for this CD. I must have seen this album in every stores 1 dollar bargain bin, and their wasn't one CD their was usually a big grotesque stack of them sitting thier+music
Hillbilly What?+N+ok, I bought this cd and it gets 2 stars one each for the songs "Believe" and "I'm Building Bridges". The other songs are horrible. Ronnie is the lead vocalist for a VERY good reason! They were very smart to get Vince Gill(the best!)to do background vocals on Bridge's. Save your money or you too will be adding this one to your yard sale!+music
This album is near perfect.+P+This and Dark Side of the Moon are the most balanced records Pink Floyd has ever produced.  Just the right amount of sax, synth, drums, guitar, and vocals.  The album is a little different than their ealier stuff as it has mostly a possitive sound to it, in other words don't come from the Wall listening to this without giving it some time.  The only thing in question really are the "A New Machine" tracks, which are certainly different, not something you would just jump into. Will you ever like them if you don't like them inittially?  Probably not.  But other than that, everything else is utter perfection for the style of music they represent.  Listen to this album a few times and trust me, you'll love it+music
Kind of a drag, really+N+Note to soundtrack producers: When we buy a soundtrack with a bunch of good songs, we want to hear the songs. Sure, a bunch of dialog scattered throughout is fine and fun, but not when it's cut into the music! (See the soundtrack to "Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back" for how to do it right.)  Basically, what they've done here, is try to create some new experience that isn't quite the movie and isn't quite the soundtrack. You don't get to hear the full versions of the songs as the artists recorded them. The beginnings and the ends are crossfaded together with snippets of dialog. It's like a soundtrack/radio drama hybrid with no plot. The dialog runs into the song, which runs into the dialog, which runs into the song, which runs into the dialog, etc., throughout the entire CD. On the first listen, you think, "Oh, yeah, Ed complaining that the zombie blew the call-and-response in 'White Lines.' That was funny...," but then you're kind of screwed for the rest of your life because the editors have mixed in the boys doing their, "...diggeda, diggeda, diggeda..." bit right into the middle of the song. If you truly want to hear 'White Lines' or any of the other tunes, you'll have to get them elsewhere. Sorry.   I'm not sure what the objective was with this disc, but if I wanted to relive the movie, I'd pop in the DVD. If I wanted to hear the songs, I would have liked to have played the CD, but that won't work here. The songs and the movie dialog on this CD are like Siamese twins sharing a single stomach. You get one, you get the other and there's no separating them. This is a bummer since they're good songs.   What I've got now is a CD novelty that I really can't use. I may trot it out once a year, but I'll be disappointed every time. Maybe I'll sell it on eBay..+music
Welcome, but Uneven, Comeback+P+It is difficult to rate and review 'Time Out of Mind,' Bob Dylan's start to a string of late Renaissance achievements.  The album, which is named after Mercutio's line before Romeo crashes the Capulets' masquerade ball in 'Romeo and Juliet, 'finds Dylan "Love Sick" with a world that has gone wrong and left him bewildered.  These subject matters are deftly taken up with the blues with his excellent new band and Daniel Lanois at the producer helm and Jack Frost just in the wings.  The highlights are hallmark.  Even though his voice has aged and is more gravelly, it does appropriately remind one of Leon Redbone, which suits his new endeavors well.  "Love Sick" is thick and bottom-line.  With some hefty guitar chords he sings his heart out.  Then, he comes up with "Dirt Road Blues," arguably the C.D.'s best song.  With what can be described as rockabilly blues, he and his band transport us to the Texas border for some hot chili.  "Starting in the Doorway" reminds us of his vintage work.  Sometimes this number gets as langorous, however, like the "...summer night..." he walks through.  Similarly, "Million Miles" is good blues, even if the title tells us much about the length of the destination.  "Trying to Get to Heaven" and the beautifully shimmering "Not Dark Yet," really hit the spot with two of his top songs here.  Also worthy of his latter legacy is the celebrated ballad, "Make You Feel My Love," which is as eloquent and substantial as his best love songs.  Also good quality can be found with the heavy "Cold Irons Bound".  This song lingers a bit too long, but especially the closer, "Highlands," doesn't come close to reaching the destination and isn't close to climbing to the heights of a classic like "Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands".    'Time Out of Mind' was able to capture enough attention by landing Dylan on the cover of 'Newsweek' magazine.  He deserved it anyway, but this album is a mixed comeback, providing some disapointment despite the hype.  In spots he delivers his old genius in a different venue, but 'Oh, Mercy,' before it, and 'Modern Times,' after it demonstrate that there are a lot of Dylan classics to be found more worthy than 'Time Out of Mind'+music
Solid+P+This is his weakest attempt but it is still very good and consistent throughout the album. Now why is it his worst because it sounds too commercial for me and that is my opinion and other people will say otherwise. I like almost every song here but I skip about 4 of them and the rest I can listen to all the way through. I recommend this album to fans of down south music and maybe rap fans in general but most rap fans probably never heard of him and most are skeptic but I recommend it+music
Not Even Worth "Rent"ing+N+It's tough not to surpass judgment on the ruinous film when attempting to evaluate the soundtrack of `Rent' because the big screen adaptation was as intolerable as countless nonsensical movie tie-ins that MTV used to excel at force-feeding down our throats.  But what exactly is missing from this recording?  Well, while it's hard to pinpoint, it is so easy to comprehend.  There is no joy - no hope - no struggle in the mechanized performances.  We don't experience the lyrics, we remain unmoved by the static orchestration - each musical number is executed as stoically as a soundtrack should not be presented - on stage, such enunciation and bombast is called for; in a film there is room for embellishment - and restraint.  Here, there is none - only aging players, too old for their roles, caterwauling mind-numbing denunciations and explorations.  What `Rent' lacks is a timeless score, despite its cult status.  While some tracks retain their original prettiness, more often than not we are assaulted with Jim Steinman-like pomposity from a cast that can't seem to project over the deafening drum machine.  If you must revel in `Rent', dole out the cash for the original cast recording.  At least there's Daphne Rubin-Vega.  My grade:  C-+music
Not as great as said by most+N+Yeah i read the reviews on how great this album is. Dont get me wrong its unique but that doesnt mean im gonna feel it. Im sure some underground head is gonna read this and trip and write a review dissin me. So let me tell you there is just as much fake ass artists in the underground as mainstream. So dont discriminate mainstream and underground. Give mainstream a chance. You might like it. I dont even talk about whats what anymore. I like Outkast, The Game, and some G Unit that doesnt make me a "a non true hip hop head". Oh yeah back to the album. I really didnt like it cuz it was borin and left me thinking about other things. Im mad that i bought this cd. I will give him a 2 star for effort though. Heed my words majority kids+music
Stick with the original soundtracks+N+Like other uses have pointed out, the music are NOT conducted by John Williams nor performed by the London Symphony Orchestra, and they do NOT sound the same with the music from the movies.  You are still getting a nice collection of music, but for the REAL John Willims music, you gotta buy the original soundtracks.  These products just don't measure up to the authenticity of the glorious works by John Williams+music
a mix of old and new...more new+N+This sounds a lot like 'Out of time', but not quite as good in some  respects. 'Pop song 89' is a perfect opening to the album, it moves along nicely and is pretty catchy. Other highlights include 'World Leader Pretend', with nice percussion and steel guitars.  There are three acoustic songs which began kind of a theme on the next couple of albums. 'You are the everything' to me has absolutely no melody and moves along rather boringly. 'The wrong child' attempts to utilise harmony vocals. They are completely out of key with each other. Another poor effort. The high 'OKAYYYY' parts are unbelievably out of tune. 'Hairshirt' is third cut in the same vein as the previous two. Same chordal structure without much melody going on anywhere. Clearly, the ballads needed to be perfected. 'Orange Crush' is a more catchy tune. Mike Mills can also be heard in the chorus and, at the risk of sounding controversial, he actually has a better voice. Much purer. Why he did not sing any lead until the next album, is just unbelievable. Probably the strongest track. The best way of summing up this album is that it consists of three types of songs... 1) The Pop songs - Pop song 89 (good), Get up (ok), Stand (rubbish), The bonus cut (ok and catchy) 2) The ballads - Mentioned above, all rubbish. 3) The rock songs - World leader Pretend (good - toes line of being a ballad also), I remember California (grundgy, not too bad), Orange Crush (very good), Turn you inside out (rubbish+music
Why?+N+Why? ...Words, Lover's Prayer, To Love Somebody...why? I was pleased to hear Juliet again but resinging Barry's leads is a mistake. Would have loved to hear the brothers together doing a tribute album to Mo instead. When I look at this album, all I can say is "Why?+music
Lil' Kim...notorious for making horrid music.+N+Biggie put her on the map. Why, i'll never know. So she sucked off the fame he gave her (not the only thing she's been sucking) Also, being a Biggie fan, the name of this cd (proving my point about Biggie) was offensive and disrespectful. This is not rap, this is pop. If you think this is rap, you need to get smacked with a "The Lost Children of babylon" album and learn real rap. Nothing but two dollar trash by a two dollar wh*re+music
Awesome!+P+Jesus &amp; Mary Chain have 2 sets of fans, those who like the feedback drenched &quot;Psychocandy&quot;. And the rest of us, who like everything after. &quot;Automatic&quot; is full of 50's - 60's guitar style rockers played in the JMC way. Perhaps, one little flaw is the drum machine. But you can't deny the sheer power of &quot;Her way of praying&quot;, &quot;Coast to Coast&quot;, &quot;Blues from a gun&quot; and the classic &quot;Head on&quot;. Without all the feedback, the songs really come out! They made it a point to stray away from &quot;Psychocandy&quot;'s sound alltogether and sort of reinvented themselves, pissing off their early fans. (Like the reviewer before me). The band made that very clear with the title of their next great album &quot;Honey's dead&quot; in 1992. Get it+music
Short changed+P+Excellent album, great songs, beautiful bluegrass voice and some really fine backing muscicians, so why am I left unsatisfied? The total total track length is only 34 minutes! Thats not good value for my purchase, most albums run for 40-50 minutes. Nice album - shame about the length+music
I didn't think that they could get any gayer..(is that a word? Gayer???)+N+Listening to this album is like receiving a LONG SLOW ENEMA. I still have no idea what people see in this much OVERATED band. I understand the comparisons to U2 (which, by the way, is a far superior band), but Pink Floyd?? Pink Floyd runs circles around this poor excuse for a band musically and lyrically!! Creep is their only good song.....There I said it+music
where is vnv, this is not vnv+N+I am very  dissapointed with this album, it has not the mistyc of VNV.  I suppose that this was only a mistake of these musician stars. I will wait the next release. +music
1-1/2 stars -- Dumb, dry and trashy+N+First things first: this compilation shouldn't even be called Jermaine Dupri Presents... because JD is only involved with two songs on here (he stars in "Gotta Getcha", and he produces one other song). Anyway, I'm not exactly sure what possessed him to put together Young, Fly & Flashy Vol. 1; whether he was just thinking about "the way we were", or if he just wanted to showcase some new young talent. Actually, maybe I shouldn't have said the latter, because it looks like JD dug up some of the most UNtalented people ever.  But things aren't very inspiring with the known artists, like when J-Kwon and Daz try to save "10 Toes". And I wonder how long ago that song was made because in it, J-Kwon says he's 17, but that's how old he was when "Tipsy" came out. I don't know WHY JD decided to dig up has-beens KP & Envyi for the dismal "Put Cha Hands Up" (that title even sounds like it came from 1997), and as for "I Think They Like Me", if it's really Dem Franchize Boyz' song, how come they're the only ones in there that can't rap?  Most of the rappers on here are unknowns, but in the end they really aren't WORTH knowing because even JD is a better rapper than they are. Miss B's "Grown Man" suffers from a corny chorus, and T. Waters' "Throw'd Off" is just plain wack. And Cato's lazy "So What" made me say just that. But the album's nadir is the title track, performed by Young Capone, Midnight, Champagne Shawty and C-Dirt. Not only is there lackluster production, but the guys' rapping is so bad that they make Chingy look like Rakim.  The only saving grace to this whole compilation is Bun-B's verse on the otherwise terrible "Kodak Moment". Unlike that title, though, this album isn't anything to remember. If Jermaine ever makes a Young, Fly & Flashy Vol. 2, I'll be the first person not to get it.  Anthony Ruper+music
Best of the Best+P+This cd is full of emotion, and a lot of fun!   It's like a great story in 10 awesome songs!  1. "Get Stoned" takes you back to (or reminds you of) your teenage years of love.  2. "How Long" shows the ache of a break up, and how much it hurts to have someone else with the person you love.  3. "By the Way" takes you to a place where everyone has/will be one day, wanting everything to be your way, and perfect.   4. "Nothin' Good About Goodbye" relates how hard it is to finally cut your love off, and how every time you try to end it, they just keep coming back.   5. "Bliss (I Don't Wanna Know)" about the way you try and try to make everything work out and how you really don't want to know it's the end.  6. "Better Than Me" is about the realization that you really miss someone but that they deserve much more than what you have to give.  7. "Room 21" a great song about a day at a bar that leads to a great night!! 8. "Lips Of An Angle" a very emotional song about two people that were in a relationship and are still there for each other. they still wish they were together. 9. "Homecoming Queen" a song about a girl that is missing, someone that everyone took for granted!  10. "Shoulda" very great song to end the cd with! it is about not saying those 3 little words and wanting to change it!!   This cd is a must buy!!! no matter what kind of music your into.. it is an awesome cd that relates to everyday happenings... it is the best that rock has to offer!!! +music
Intens, hard-rocking, original.+P+Up till now my favorite Chris Whitley album was Dirt Floor. There's another favorite now; this latest album by the late great floor-stomping singer is raw and rocking with a twist. The hard drive works to perfection in combination with a souring violin. Buy this CD and if you do not own a copy of Dirt Floor buy that one tw+music
An excellent CD!!!!+P+"Looking Up" is absoulutley wonderful! Every single song is great. Gregg Karukas is simply smooth jazz finest musician. This CD is extremley enjoyable and creative+music
Hellogoodbye scores with Debut CD +P+Hellogoodbye has recently become one of my favorite new bands. They have a unique emo sound , with a touch of techno . The best tracks on their Debut " Zombies! Aliens! Vampires! Dinosaurs!", in my opinion are their first single " Here (in your arms)", " Baby , It's Fact" , " Touchdown Turnaround (don't give up on me) " , and " All of your love" . Their lyrics are just plain catchy , and their songs vary throughout the album . Some are loud , and some are soft love songs . Out of all the songs on the album , I can totally see Touchdown Turnaround as their next single . It's a great song , with really fun lyrics . If your a fan of Bright Eyes , you'll like this band . For some reason , they remind me of them in some songs . It's a fun CD that can be played over and over again.+music
Boring+N+I cant say i especially like any of the songs on this album. All of them are incredibly repetitive.   If you like aphex's repetitive stuff, buy it, otherwise buy one of his better albums, like Richard D. James or Drukq+music
NOT THAT GOOD+N+I AM DISAPPOINTED OF THIS CD BECAUSE FRED HAMMOND AND RFC IS OFF THE CHAIN BUT THIS CD IS NOT. I REALLY WOULDNT RECOMMEND IT BECUASE THEY HAVE DONE BETTER AND THIS CD IS A WASTE OF MONEY. IF YOU STILL WANT TO BUY IT THEN YOU CAN BUT I REALLY DIDNT LIKE IT. THERE WERE SOME SONGS THAT ARE GOOD BUT THE REST ARE WEA+music
Scott's Review [jassiel2001@hotmail.com]+P+Commissioned. One of the greatest groups of all time. Really gives it to you with this album. With lush flowing ballads such as,&quot;Do You Still Love Me&quot; and,&quot;Crucified With Christ.&quot; This album also gives you bangin' joints such as,&quot;Irreplaceable Love&quot; and, &quot;I Can Love Agin.&quot; This CD gives you all that you need, and will really help you with your walk with Christ. This is the year 2001, and I still rate this album(done in 1996)number one out of all my music I have at home. In church or out of church, I encurage you to buy this album. You wont be disapointed+music
A 'Real Good' and 'Intimate' Live Album+P+When the Corrs deliver it 'live', they deliver it real good. Whether it is 'covers' or 'originals', it is as good a live album as I have heard. The intimacy with the audience is evident and all the songs stand-up well 'live'. In my view, this is the best 'Corrs' album out there. Bono pops up on two tracks as an added bonus+music
The Good Stuff+P+By far, this is AFI's greatest release, period, if you don't like it, go kiss Raf. "No Dave Party" is an effing great instrumental track, if ya don't know where it is, ya better start looking for it. Every single song on this album is perfect, this is my favorite album of all time. This is the last album with the classic line-up and how fitting that it's their best, no? Geoff went on to play in Tiger Army, he left them and is now in HorrorPops. Geoff's bass playing is superb on this, the Good Stuff to say the least. Mark's guitar playing is pretty good, and Adam's drumming is the fast stuff. Now, good old Davey, the DXH. People will complain and say "He sounds like he's on elium" and that "His voice is too high". Well, the man was 20 when he recorded this, what d'ya expect? The lyrics are really good too, if you look closely, it's got some pretty good straight edge stuff on it. Then it's got the typical outcast, teen fury stuff. If you're a pissed off teenager and dig the real hardcore stuff-7 Seconds, Minor Threat, Black Flag, etc.-not that fraudcore Atreyu, From First To Last crap you should get this. So yeah, best album ever, buy it.   JX+music
Go buy a Sinatra album+N+Every singer has his song, on this album Robbie nails Beyond The Sea and the rest of the songs suck.  Louis Armstrong nailed Mack the Knife and Frank Sinatra nailed It Was A Very Good Year.  Robbie William does not have the depth these singers have to pull off these songs.  Sorry.  Hope you did not purchase this album.  You can get the Finding Nemo soundtrack for half the price and it has Beyond the Sea on it+music
Different?  NOPE, its the same stupid Cold.+N+Yeah, this is metal madness!!  Scooter delivers such gruesome lyrics and vocals, the two guitarists do psychotic shredding riffs and blazing solos, the drummer does machine gun double bass at 400 miles per second!!  Metal is revived!!  As you can see, I'm joking.  Scooter has little baby squirel nuts, hence his super weak and annoying voice.  His lyrics about "I hate my parents, my daddy touched my privates" tripe is nothing new, and nothing pleasing to the ears.  The guitarists are very bad, they're downtuned and they only do powerchords and don't solo (because they can't).  The drummer is very basic, nothing special.  Bass?  Can't hear it.  Want the best album of 2005?  Go for "Ghost Reveries" by Opeth.  Opeth cares about music, Cold only cares about fame and money.+music
What's become of the Great American Songbook?+N+Oo God, one more time!  This is a collection of the cream of the cream of the Great American Songbook by a rock'n'roll singer who contributes nothing at all to American culture. This rate #1 is to express my deep deception about the successful album series.  Over exposed material which has been treated so many different ways by so many different vocalists with artistry should be treated respectfully.  I am not a dictator but I would vote for a Law that would impose respect for some art expressions which represents the treasure of American culture.  More than that, the series success reflects lack of understanding of the music context by people who should search for entertainment in a more valid and truer way.  That's the deal: there is truth missing, there is a sensation of a money-make production. Mellow arrangements, neglectable performances, lacking creativeness. To be completely forgotten some years ahead.+music
Dear hipster: why read this review -- you're going to buy it anyway+N+When I saw the Futureheads at Chicago's Empty Bottle in 2004, it was a revelation of jumproping vocal harmonies, savage guitar abuse and anthemic absurdity. The band's self-titled debut album was just as exciting. The Futureheads have barely stopped touring since, and it shows. All of their technical craft remains evident on News & Tributes, but there are few if any memorable moments. The songwriting just isn't there. And believe me: the band knows it. At this year's Pitchfork festival, they played perhaps three songs from N&T, choosing to lean on the older, tighter, hookier material. Want a great new rock album? Go Buy the Tokyo Police Club EP. +music
Beethoven Rediscovered!!!!!+P+I was curious to listen to David Zinman and the Zurich Orchestra after all I had read in  the CD guide books and magazines. This is my sixth full cycle (Karajan 1963 and 1977, Klemperer,Bernstein/VPO and Toscanini) and these days is definetely my favourite. Zinman brings new life to the symphonies- period. The Barenreiter edition may play a role in the freshness of the music but the passion of maestro and orchestra makes you feel as if you are present in the music hall, being a spectator of a live performance.  The first symphonies were the greatest surprise for me, and I can now see the maturation of Beethoven, where as the older approaches interepreted these pieces as small "Eroicas". There is no doubt there are better interepretations of individual symphonies out there - ex. Carlos Kleiber on the 5th, Klemperer on the "Eroica"-old style or Furtwangler on the 1952 recording of the "Choral" - but this fact can not overshadow what I find as an excellent set at a great price+music
Brilliant.+P+Ineffably singular.  You think you've heard these symphonies before, but the combination of a smaller orchestra and period instrumentation with ur-text orchestrations makes these recordings a revelation.  Not the least of the set's pleasures is Zinman's respecting of the real tempi called for in the scores - at times a tad faster than they're usually played - which strips the music of the ponderous heaviness that too often creeps in.  One reviewer loved the whole set except for the Fifth, and I can understand why - the Fifth here sounds unlike you've ever heard it before.  I'd say, having listened, that's a good thing.  The best bargain in classical recordings this year+music
That Does It... I'm Bout To Drop Me A Album+N+This is a good example of rap today.  You don't need to be a MC to land a deal, or even know how to rhyme.  All you need to do is come up with a dance move, make songs about your damn clothes and how you party all the time and your on.  This ain't right man... it just ain't right !!+music
what were they thinking?+N+I can't believe some of the songs on this soundtrack...they are horrible pieces of S$#!?*&%#!#$!There are a couple good ones,but its not worth spending the money on for the c.d,not even at a used price.I can't believe they did'nt put "Low Rider" on the soundtrack,how cheap is that+music
JLP's last really good disc+P+1977's "Enigmatic Ocean" was indeed a tough act to follow, given the improvisational and sonic brilliance of one Allan Holdsworth on guitar. So, instead of trying to replicate that disc, Ponty wisely leaned more in a rockier/funky direction for "Cosmic Messenger", knowing that NOBODY could match Holdsworth's unique contributions or even get close.   What results is a collection of songs that retain a lot of the characteristics of Ponty's earlier efforts but a bit leaner and meaner sounding. Of the 2 guitarists, Peter Maunu definitely comes up the most distinct sounding with his soaring melodic bluesy rock sound. What I really enjoyed though was the huge punchy sounding rhythm section of drummer Casey Schurrel and bassist Ralphe Armstrong (I especially loved Ralphe's huge thick growling fretless tone here, deeeeeelicious!). Allan Zavod provides all the appropriately spacey textures with a bank of synths. Have to admit though I would've loved to hear more acoustic instruments as well to balance it out, as it was a bit synth/electronics heavy.  As for the highlights, "Ethereal Mood" is beautifully hypnotic with not much more than acoustic violin, chiming acoustic guitars, fretless bass and tablas, very beautiful haunting melody. On the funkier/rocky side, "Art of Happiness", "Don't Let The World Pass You By" and "Fake Paradise" come out swinging.   The one low point for me is the ending tune "Egocentric Molecules" (corny title BTW!), which sounds more like a mathematical exercise more than it does music. Not one of Ponty's better compositional moments in this Owl's opinion.  Overall, a solid album worth having, but not groundbreaking by any stretch. After this, JLP would seem to just keep making the same record over and over again+music
The second star is for persistance+N+While not quite as bad as some of the stinkers which were to follow, this is another terrible effort by the so-called fab four. Yesterday is instantly forgettable, Dizzy Miss Lizzy sounds like it could have been written in the 50's and Ticket to Ride is an insult to my ears quite frankly. As usual, I did enjoy Ringo's excellent drumming and I liked the song Act Naturally. For shame! +music
Inner thoughts from a hollow man.+N+Imagine no possessions?  Fine, then you get rid of your jewel encrusted luxury palaces.  Imagine no religion?  Fine, if religion's such a "crutch", then you forsake your million dollar drug habit.  Imagine no countries?  Fine, then you move from England or America to Africa or El Salvador.  The world will be as one?  Fine, then you act like an adult and don't abandon your wife and child when they need you the most.  John Lennon was a text book phony.  He was a grown-up with a child's brain who ordered the rest of us to live a life that he wouldn't.  Maybe if he didn't squander his days snorting cocaine through one hundred dollar bills he would have recognized how utterly ridiculous he sounded.....then and now.  The utopian dreams of the 60's are history, and they were destroyed by none other than Lennon himself-an unscrupulous fantasy peddler who selfishly preyed upon the optimism of a generation.  His blatant hypocrisy was so obnoxious that the very thought of his music makes my stomach turn.  Thank you very much.  -DW. +music
Read the Review (4.5 Stars)+P+I write this review of "The Documentary" as The Game's sophomore release "Doctor's Advocate" prepares to be let loose on the populous. In January of 2005 The Game was let loose for the first time as he delivered his debut album "The Documentary" on Aftermath/G-Unit records. It was a much hyped and much anticipated release. As it dropped universal praise was hefted upon The Game for the record that was sonically spectacular and showed a revived west coast. Lyrically some people hated on The Game for name dropping so much, I won't lie sometimes it's a little tiresome, but as an obsessive hip hop nerd I like to hear people rap about hip hop. Its fun to figure out the connections they are trying to make and in all honesty it's nice to know that at least one artist in this game actually knows his history and respects the architects of our culture.   Pretty quickly after the release it all started to fall apart. The Game and his boss at G-Unit, 50 Cent, seemed to already be on shaky ground before the release, but upon the release it seemed everything was all good internally between the two camps with 50's hooks all over the album along with several guest verses and Game's screams of "G-UNIT!" always keeping you aware of who was responsible for this project. Then all of a sudden it seemed it came crashing down. Game wouldn't ride with the Unit on their beef with Nas - he was out.   We didn't really care because those of us who already had the record saw the talent that the kid had and we had "The Documentary" to prove it. The record continued to grow and went on to sell an absurd amount of records. I got to say good on The Game because listening to "The Documentary" it's obvious he put a lot of work into this album and that it meant a lot to him. He likes to talk about his life and what he's been through to get to this point of releasing his debut record. He likes to praise his influences. But most of all he likes hip hop.   So as I look back at "The Documentary" almost 2 years later I can't help but feel what he's saying. It's the truth of that time in his life. Sure Game is cocky and seems confused and or lost with his life right now, but the one thing that he does know is hip hop and he knows how to write verses. If you don't have "The Documentary" you need this record if for no other reason to see a young man grow. Without "The Documentary" you will not understand "Doctor's Advocate" (which I'll write a review for sooner than 2 years!), the record that will prove he did grow up and doesn't need anyone's help, 50 or Dre (trust me I've heard it). "The Documentary" may not be a classic but it's damn good and deserves a place in not just your hip hop collection but in your music collection as this is an album that goes beyond the definition of genre and is just music at its simplest form.+music
The Documentary+P+Excellent cd..every track worth downloading...well excluding the intro outro things.This is how i rate each track.  The only dud is don't worry, game hardly raps at all on that track the rest are good, some are great, and some are classics!!(Higher, Put You On The Game, How We Do, We Ain't, Westside Story).  All in all an incredible debut album...I've already heard a track from games next album, The Doctors Advocate, and I can tell you he is not gonna have a sophmore slump..It's gonna be hot! Get this and some mixtaps to tide you over till november 7th.    Intro  Westside Story-10/10  Dreams-6/10  Hate It Or Love It-7/10  Higher-10/10  How We Do-10/10  Don't Need Your Love-5/10   Church For Thugs-7/10  Put You On The Game-10/10  Start From Stcratch-7/10  The Documentary-6/10  Runnin'-6/10  No More Fun And Games-8/10  We Ain't-10/10  Where I'm From-8/10  Special-6/10  Don't Worry-4/10  Like Father Like Son-7/10  Outr+music
Meh.+N+Basically, I think they sold out on this soundtrack. Alot of the songs that are prominently featured throughout the movie are missing (for example, Sum 41's Makes No Difference, Mest's What's The Dillio, Bis' Detour (Do You Wanna Go My Way?)) and instead, we find alot of songs of which we simply hear clips of during the competition mixes. Now, if they had actually featured the mixes in their entirety, it would be different. But instead we are left with a bunch of, quite honestly, mediocre songs+music
A FEW GREAT SONGS!+P+AND JUSTICE FOR ALL is one of METALLICAS BEST ALBUMS...I DONT REALLY LIKE THE LYRICS IN BLACKENED THAT MUCH, I MEAN I LIKE THE SONG BLACKENED. ONE OF MY FAVORITE TRACKS IS EYE OF THE BEHOLDER!! TITLE IS GREAT, BUT TOO LONG!! GET THIS WITH 5 OF THEIR OTHER ALBUMS LIKE BLACK, MASTER OF PUPPETS, RIDE THE LIGHTNING, RELOAD, AND LOAD+music
Worst Band In The World+N+I can't believe that I'm NOT ALLOWED to give this zero stars.  This band is garbage. The record is worse than garbage. It's septic sludge. The music is unoriginal, cloying and boring. The vocals are the most annoying sound I've ever heard. I wish the courts would gag and restrain this band. This band couldn't stop a war if they had a nuclear bomb.  Boycott+music
Stevie's Double Crowning Achievement!+P+I'm one of those reviewers that rarely rates music that hasn't touched me in one way or another. So when I felt that I wanted to write a review for a Stevie Wonder album, I ended up struggling over which of his great releases I should review. I love ALL of his mid-seventies releases....most notably, "Innervisions", "Fullfillingness...", and, of course, "Songs...". I guess I finally decided to 'tackle' this one based on its historical significance to the art of Music. For one, Stevie was "coming into his own" as far as musical expression and social commentary within his songs. Other than the great Bob Marley and Marvin Gaye, Stevie was at the forefront of writing about the joys, pains, positives and negatives of Human exsistance on Earth...and he did it very well. Songs such as "Village Ghetto Land", "Pastime Paradise", "Saturn" and "Have a Talk with God" among others, were as powerful 'messages' one could experience through a set of speakers. Secondly, He was able to finally gain TOTAL control of his musical vision from Motown and Berry Gordy....even more so than Marvin had done with "Whats Going On"...and this TOTAL control shows most prevelant on "Songs" than any previous release leading up to this one(IMO). There's certainly a little bit of everything on "Songs"---- the joy of life on "Isn't She Lovely";  black man's contributions to evolution in "Black Man"; World Love and Peace in "I am Singing"; the joys and pains of childhood in "I Wish"; Spiritual guidance in "Have a talk with God"; Desperation in the World's Ghettos in "Village Ghetto Land" , and even some "Props" to Mr. Ellington in "Sir Duke". One could literally go on like this for every song on this double album....Yes, very moving, significant statements indeed! As for the actual music and musicians, they are "all over the board" here (and Stevie certainly plays his share of the instruments, however, not as exstinsively as past albums). Every musician involved in "Songs" played exactly what each track called for, and, at the same time, still managed to put their 'mark' on these great cuts. The listener will be happy to find mellow, introspective songs...Upbeat, funky rockers...Spanish-tinged music....and even Stevie's brand of Fushion (Contusion)... Overall, A wonderful assortment of musical styles and genres mixed into one of the most important double LPs ever released. As a closing note, I am somewhat of a new-comer to this great artist, and yes, I am white. However, I feel this is one of a handful of artists that crosses/bridges ALL ethnic groups...weather black, white, yellow, or red. Please don't let the color of your skin (or Stevie's) stop you from experiencing some of the most important 'Art' ever produced. Strongly recommended, along with any other releases from this Genius+music
What a horrible album+N+Usually I skip over album reviews if they are too extreme (5 or 1 star).  But it's quite called for here.  CAN A MAN RAP WITH ANY LESS CHARISMA??!!    Cam's come quite a long ways, as evidenced by this album.  Average production.  Uninspired, generic rhyming schemes and also-ran content.  The production and engineering are fuzzy and lo-fi - and it's not on purpose.  An amateur job all around.  It would be nice if this was cut to 4 songs and labeled a demo tape.  There's definitely growing pains all throughout.  Skip to his later selection+music
Great music, only one cd.+N+Reason for my rating is the fact I only got one cd.  I mean, 51 bucks for one cd is messed up.  I guess I bought it after reading the reviews hoping the cd had like a bonus disc inside that they didn't put on the description... oh well.  If you got the money and would like to own atleast ONE of the cd of this album, buy it+music
Disappointed+N+Not the type of music I had envisioned...much slower than I was hoping for.+music
too much of a good thing+N+don't just automatically hit "not helpful" because you unconditionally love sufjan, think about it. these are b sides, and more of the same. problem with sufjan is, he's brilliant, but not exactly varied. he's beginning to ape himself over and over again with similar time signatures, arrangements, and all slowly evolving towards the charm of a book report. Would like to see Sufjan stop the cloying/cutesie states project and sing about something personal to himself rather than the construction of a ferris wheel in Illinoi+music
Real country+P+This is what country music lacks today, the passion of John Anderson.  All these mindless, &quot;popcountry&quot; songs are no match for ANY song by John Anderson+music
Buyers Beware+N+These are the same tracks from Totally Buble which was released without Buble's consent.  "Totally Buble" is not an album that I wanted to be released. They were songs I recorded for a film called "Totally Blonde" many years ago before I was signed to 143/Reprise Records. The decision to release it as an album was made by the film's producer, and I had no control over stopping him. It is important for everyone to know, that I only want to release quality music to my fans by offering my best work and I sincerely apologize if you purchased this album." - Michael Buble +music
If your heart beats more than once an hour, DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM!+N+First, I should remind you, Dear Reader, that since italics, boldface type, and underlines can't be used in these kind of reviews, I have to use one capital letter in some mid-sentence words to slightly stress them and use all capitals to stress other words even more!       Anyway, one star on this review is one star too many to give this album and band.       I received this album as a gift for my birthday while I was on the other side of the country.  I'd never even Heard of this band until then, much less any of their songs by pure and simple osmosis.  When I finally got around to taking it out of the wrapping and putting it into the CD player of my car on the way to work and back, I was not impressed with the opening song, nor the second, nor the third, etcetera, and so on, and so forth ...       I kept wondering if this coma-inducing drone (interrupted only by the screaming of the word "Nothing" at least 20 times at the end of the first song) was some kind of tactical build-up by the band so they could eventually break out a song that made them at least Somewhat Big (much less a hit) to start the party.        You know the kind of song I mean, don't you, Dear Reader?  I mean the kind of song that makes you think "Whoa!  Who's THIS?!" because it has a either a great opening, or a great first line or four, or at least Something to grab your attention within the first minute, like Ani DiFranco's song "Out of Range" would do in less than 16 seconds.       Anyway, MANY extremely torturous minutes later, the 9th song came along (ironically for me, it's called "Wishful Thinking") and I honestly couldn't take anymore of this DRIVEL!  I gave this band A Whole NINE TRIES to make something that at least Resembles an impression and all I got was only Slightly less musical boredom as when I did when I once tried to listen to the only bad album I currently know by Tangerine Dream: "ZEIT".  That album, by the way, was basically four 20-minute bits of what seemed like people in an orchestra tuning up their instruments and eventually matching one single note with each other BEFORE the conductor starts a symphony you never get to hear.      As I said, this album is only a micrometer less boring.       I honestly cannot understand how anyone who scouts for the music industry could have happened along this sorry excuse for a band and thought to themselves "WOW!  These guys are On FIRE!  I must get them to the studio and P.R. them IMMEDIATELY!!"       Let me put it this way, Dear Reader: Remember that song "Next Time I Fall In Love" by Peter Cetera and Amy Grant back in the mid to late 1980's?  In comparison to the so-called songs on this album, that cutesy ballad will sound more intense and energetic than "Paranoid" by Black Sabbath.      Maybe Wilco got their record contract by winning a contest of who could bore an audience the quickest.       Oh, and if you're wondering to yourself, "Oh yeah? Well,  let's see this guy (as in ME) make a Better album!"        I already Have made a better album and I'll gladly show it to you.  Leave me a response to this review if you want that proof.  AAAaaannnnnd ... CUT! That's a wrap+music
Brainwashed Anthem for the Neo-Conservatives+N+Wow.  Where do I even begin?  It is sad to think that so many Americans are as misinformed about Iraq and the war on terror as this Darryl Worley is.  First off, I don't know anyone who is saying "you shouldn't worry about Bin Laden."  If anything people against the war in Iraq wanted our government to spend more time and efforts tracking down al-Qaeda's leader.    The fact that Bush Jr. will not make the hunt for Bin Laden his #1 priority is one of the many reasons why millions of Americans voted for Kerry.  They want a leader who will stand up and protect us from the mastermind who attacked us and not send us on a wild goose chase like what Bush Jr. has unfortunatly done.  Think for once Darryl!   Next, if you are going to write a song about invading Iraq at least make references to it.  Also, now that the war in Iraq and our president's approval ratings are so low. I doubt Darryl Worley would ever make a sequel song about staying the course in Iraq.  He and his managers are probably thinking about the next tragedy to cash in on.  Hmmmm maybe he will $ing about Hurricane Katrina next...  We have spent so-far 500 billon dollars and more than that worth in human life lost in Iraq, all that in  a war that "ended" according to our president on May 1, 2003.  Perhaps, outsourcing jobs to other countries should be extended to crappy songwriters too.+music
Tanning with your eyes open wide!+N+This album is incredibly ambient with lots of electronic sounds floating, and breathy voices echoing in and out of the stratosphere. Pacific is simple in its structure; and for the most part is listenable. At timed it tries to do way too much of the underwater country and emo blend for the eardrums, but their down-tempo jinglebell opiate trip is a recommendation if you like slower music that's stuck between trying to impress the scenesters and rehashing acoustic grunge. Overall I'd say this album would be perfect for a midnight mescaline trip on a west-coast beach, or some other equally applicable deviation. The group includes Lucas Jensen, clay, and Howard Hudson, and is currently playing shows to support the release.

XXX IS HOTT+P+Vin Diesel is the next big thing!  So the music is a match+music
A Defining Moment In '90's Punk+P+The brilliance of the work on the early Bad Religion albums (Suffer, No Control and Against The Grain) is that it manages to be simultaneously delicate yet undeniably coarse. In terms of the lyrics, they can't get much more intricate, and yet they retain a hardened edge laced with a characteristically punk sense of discontent, which makes for a perfect balance. Vocally and musically the Bad Religion of Against The Grain are far more raw than they are they are currently, but there is still a sharpness which ensures that their raw edge does not make them come across as simply sloppy. Highlights include Anesthesia - with Brett doing what he does best and delving fearlessly into realm of the deeply troubled individual, and Greg furiously spitting social criticisms via his seamless polysyllabic approach in Get Off and Quality and Quantity. God Song is another gem which sits comfortably in the company of other Bad Religion tracks questioning the nature of religion, such as Chimaera and Generator, which are arguably some of their most effective songs. It's inconceivable that the boys will once again achieve the kind of punk perfection they did with this album, (and with Generator and Stranger Than Fiction) so no self-respecting punk should hesitate buying a copy of Against The Grain. It is a classic which effectively helped to define the genre of 90's punk rock+music
What were they thinking?+N+Man, I can't believe Cold, Weezer, and Unwritten Law actually stooped to the level of doing something like this.  All the other bands, I can see it, but these guys are way too good to have anything to do with the WWF!  2 stars for a phenomenal new Cold song, but why oh why does it have to be here+music
What? Why+N+Ok so now Metallica decides Hey lets ripe off some more people because we can't do our own stuff without it sucking! You do know that Dave from Megadeth wrote all of there good songs. Without Dave around they sucked!!!!! I have sat down and tryed to rock out with this one because one of friends had it and I would just like to for the most part this thing sucks!!!! The Misfit's song they did was the worst cover ever!!!!! Hell COF does a way better cover of a Misfit song. If your looking for some band like to make money off of other peoples work then get any of there cd's. Now if your looking for some real metal then go get everything from Slayer, Megadeth, Cannibal Corpse, Deicide, Dimmu, and even COF because these bands are way better then anything they have ever put out!!+music
Truly, A "Timeless" Album!!+P+Boy,when I first listened to this tribute to the famous Hank Williams Sr., I thought, "Wow, how different this is!". I gotta tell ya, all the artist's on there do a fatastic job! Tom Petty's version of "You're Gonna Change (Or I'm Gonna Leave) to my estimation is about the best cut on the album. Emmylou Harris' version's of "Lost on the River" and "Alone and Forsaken" are just wonderfull and Emmylou's version of "Alone and Forsaken" is about the best version I have heard of that song by another artist. I do have to say that the worst of all takes on the album is Johnny Cash's "I Dreamed About Mama Last Night". Thank goodness it's the last song on the album. Maybe it is because I never liked the song in the first place. I do like Johnny though. The true Hank Sr. fan will love this ablum. Especially if your a music fan+music
Two Great Songs+N+Mississippi and Sugar Baby are great songs, up there with the best Dylan has done. However, the rest of the album, while listenable, isn't all that memorable. Still, I suppose it's amazing that he can still produce a couple of great songs still, after over 40 years performing and recording. The same cannot be said for '60s peers like Paul McCartney or the Stones. Overall, Time Out of Mind was better, although that too was a little overrated, with only Not Dark Yet, Standing in the Doorway and Trying to Get to Heaven truly belonging to the canon of great Bob songs. +music
Better luck next album+N+This is an album just full of bubble-gum pop songs. If you actually hear music, don't buy this. And her little shrill in Go on and Cry is horrible.  Better luck next time. If there is a next time+music
GREAT COMPANION TO THE "AIN'T I'M A DOG"  CD+N+I GOT THE ABOVE TITLE FROM ANOTHER VENDER AND THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO SEND THIS ONE AND THIS IS ABSOLUTLY THE BEST ROCKABILLY ON RECORD/CD.  COLUMBIA RECORDS WAS NOT KNOWN FOR THEIR ROCK AND ROLL IN THE 50'S AND IF THIS IS NOT ROCK AND ROLL I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS.  GET THIS CD AND THE COMPANION "AIN'T I'M A DOG". YOU'LL BE GLAD YOU DID+music
he needs to get back with paul brown+N+not what I was expecting from him. Everyone out there knows Boney is a fantastic saxophonist. However, this album left much to be desired. I wonder why he left Paul Brown, his former producer. He released some excellent albums with Paul brown. I don't think he's doing well enough on his own. I did not find any track particularly mind-blowing. If anyone that really knows boney doubts this, perhaps you ought to listen to "seduction" and "sweet thing" before making any comments. This latest album is nothing compared to those two. woork harder boney. I would not advise anyone new to Jazz to buy this album.+music
8 year-old Daughter hated it+N+My 8 year-old daughter hated the music and wouldn't listen to it.  I'd put it in the CD player anyway.  She disliked it so much that she took it out of the car and hid it!  I was hopeful that this would work+music
it's good, a little too influence heavy+P+I really would just love to LOVE this record, but I just hear too much of the other bands I like that it just doesn't sound as good.  Of course this is the usual hardcore fare (no it doesn't have emo parts I'm talking about real HARDCORE not emocore) but it's still good cuase they play it passionatly and you feel it man, you feel it.  My favorite line is where he says "I don't need a crew to validate me" man that line alone gave this an extra star.  Now hear is a note to those bandana wearing losers who love this album, if you are NOT in a gang DO NOT WEAR A BANDANA!  If you are not robbing a bank, don't wear a bandana!  If you are not riding a horse or fixing a fence PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DO NOT WEAR A BANDANA.  It's stupid and you just look like a dork, you'd just hate to see how many people roll their eyes when they see it (but your sooooo cool you just ignore it when those "normal" people look at you).  This music is not for emo wusses my friends, the Kid doesn't listen to Dashboard (from the sound of this record I'd say more Ensign and American Nigtmare...) they listen to real hardcore music not whatever the hell loser music you "hardcore" kids like these days.  Would you see Atreyu in these guys' cd book?  HELL NO!  I'd slap you if you even suggested it.  So I'm out and please I'd like to beat 8 out of 32 so go ahead and say "no" you freaking dork+music
Is this good?+P+Is this good? If you have ears the answer is Yes.Great tunes ,Great singers.Cooooooooooool+music
WHY PUFFY WHY+N+Bad Boy did a horrible job with this album.  There are some good songs (maybe 2-3), but over all this album is wack+music
A dumb joke...and i am not laughing+N+I do not find this CD funny in the least bit. The song "Because I Got High" has got to be the dumbest thing ever written, with one of the most boring beats and repetitive lyrics that I have ever heard. Also, there are other dumb songs like "She won't let me". He tries so hard to be funny to the teenage crowd, and in some ways he succeeds, but to most people, I think that he will just be another annoying comedy rapper that us music listeners dont need to hear+music
Get the singles +N+I saw this in a bin at Wal-mart for 2.99 and decide to get it since was 2.99.  Well, I want my money back.  No wonder I only remembered two songs from them Carmel and What would you do.  I would say get the singles to Carmel and call it a day.  I never liked What Would You Do because it was contradicting...guy at bachelor party see friend who is a stripper and tries to give her advice.  Wait..hello..you are were enjoying this lady removing clothes until you realized who it was.  The rest of the CD is slow and boring.  Claudette Ortiz has a great voice. She sort of sounds like Beyonce in songs 12 and 14 or vice versa.  Save your time, energy, and money on this Cd and enjoy these when they are played on the radio. +music
I had no idea I'd love Bruce...+P+I was never a big fan of Bruce Springsteen growing up - I was a "tweener" when "Born in the USA" came out and for some reason his music just never appealed to me.  However, this album is so different from his other stuff I've heard (which I completely admit is limited experience) and more like the music I typically like - folksy, bluesy, a bit of bluegrass, just so many things you cannot put it into a box.  LOVE IT+music
Ludacris - Chicken N Beer+P+Decent album here by Ludacris. I actually give this album about a 3.75 rating. I liked Ludacris older tracks/albums better. But this one is decent, for southern music that is. I think the production on this album is pretty good, gots some good beats here n there, some tracks are garbage, most are pretty good. Lyric wise, he does good on some tracks, some his lyrics are garbage. Gotta watch out. If your a fan of Ludacris, I dont find a reason why you wouldnt like this album. Half of it is good, half of it aint that good. Check it out before you cop it. But its good for southern tastes.  My Top 5 Songs 1.Hard Times 2.Screwed Up 3.Hip Hop Quotables 4.Teamwork 5.We Go+music
The Beatles As I Remember Them+P+"THE BEATLES - THE CAPITOL ALBUMS VOL I" . . . I HAD to get a copy of this box-set collection of the first four American Issued Albums by "The mop Tops".   I was a sophomore in high school that year when The Beatles first entered into the consciousness of the world . . .  and these four albums re-present exactly the "sounds" we first heard in our experience of the band that changed music forever.  "Meet The Beatles" . . . where we first saw the "mop top hair styles" and the half-lit faces we would eventually come to know better than our own face . . . and where we first heard "I Want To Hold Your Hand"!  "The Beatles' Second Album" . . .  with their cover of "Please Mr. Postman".  "Something New" . . . with so many tracks that became synonymous with "The Beatle Movie" --   "A HARD DAY'S NIGHT" . . .   "Beatles '65" . . .  my absolute favorite Beatles album . . . and the one that was current in my last year of high school . . . with my favorite "No Reply" . .  .and that feedback amp noise that introduces "I Feel Fine".  For me this collection of American Issued Albums from the Original Master Tapes is nostaligia . . . so many memories associated with these album covers . .and the song sequences .  .and even the "echo" quality to the sound reproducton . . . but it is much much more . . . these were great songs and great performances and great recordings!  When you listen to them even now, you realize why the Beatles were so special and such a phenomenon . . . and why they probably will never be equaled (although there have been and are and will be many contenders trying to do that).  I am glad these albums were issued in their origianl format and sound . . . and I am glad that I lived my youth through the times when all of this was "live" . . . now we only have the recordings . . . but what great recording they are!  :)  Thank You John, Paul George and Ringo! +music
Amazing+P+I saw this show about a week ago and all I have to say is, this show is amazing. Pure genius. Now, the Witch is one of my dream roles+music
thanks melania+N+I would have saved more time if I had read the reviews first, thanks for the help finding that one song I wanted! verve remix +music
shoot me now+N+i saw these guys live at a ludacris/rufio/walkman/phantom planet concert and i seriously wanted to shoot myself.  not only do i hate girl rock bands to begin with, the singer was so annoying. their performance in general was just really really bad, i mean the girl playing the keyboard looked like she just wanted to die.  they kept playing more and more songs, more than all the other bands, it was like a nightmare that wouldn't end.  her voice is annoying, no range or style whatsoever, the music has nothing going for it.  if u're into courtney love and all that crud, u may like this, otherwise bail on this one+music
no title+P+I find it really difficult to write a review about this particular record, actually to write a review about any album by six organs of admittance. that is because this album works in a very non-verbal way. it does not create any clear thoughts in me while i listen to it. instead, it is very meditative and transcendent, it speaks directly to me in a very profound way. i find this record to be very calm and quiet but also incredibly intense at the same time, and it never forces anything. this music has about the same effect on me as buddhist mantras and chants do, but i find it even better.   the music itself is consisted of acoustic guitar and drones. there are very few pieces that are lyrical on the record. the compositions themselves are brilliant and they make a brilliant whole. the record works as one piece perfectly for me.  i wouldn't compare this music to devendra banhart, vetiver or any other new acoustic outfit, nor would i compare it to any droney "post-rock" bands. comparisons are generally just something silly and irrational, something that doesn't exist, but for the purpose of trying to describe this undescribable and unique music i'd say it sounds like mixture of forementioned buddhist chants, droney music like coil's time machines and brilliant acoustic guitar.  six organs's music is unique and true, honest, without any pose, music that is concentrated on substance, not image, and i would recommend it to people who honestly strive to be that way..+music
HE IS JUST LIKE O'REILLY..A PRODUCT HAWKER+N+Most radio shows will just play best of for free( btw Howard Stern invented the " BEST OF SHOW " ) ..to think he is selling it is very Bill O'Rielly.  Sellen crap to their audience taking advantage of their popular views to make a buck...vomit , puke+music
THE VERY BEST OF MEATLOAF+P+I've been a fan of Meatloaf since His album "Bat of Hell".  I like the dramatic use of orchestral and backgound vocals.  I think that Meatloft's voice is so powerful, and these songs prove that. This is by far The best album of Meatloaf's performances. This album along with "Bat Out of Hell", and "Bat Out of Hell II" is all that you need for your collection of Meatloaf. This is a great career retrospective album+music
PERFECT DEBUT!!!!!!!!!!!!! NOT a GREAT as "Stripped" but PERFECT DEBUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!+P+This is a great CD...it doesnt quite show her true potential like "Stripped" but its an excellent debut!!!!!!!!! Britney move WAY outta the way. hahaha CANT WAIT FOR CHRISTINAS "BACK TO BASICS" AUG.15TH!!!!!!!!!!!!+music
What a waste...+N+The songs in this CD was sang by thousand other singers million times. Unless if it's done differently with new arrangements, new style, better performance it's a total waste. My suggestion, please find new songs, there are plenty out there. Give the new writers a chance, pay them few dollars and give them some royalties. And you IL DIVO, will sound more unique and different. After all you have great voices+music
An absolutely beautiful recording+P+The cast in this recording is absolutely phenomenal, and the music of John Bucchino showcases the depth and beauty of his talent. Each song is a heartbreak, starting with Creel's stunning "Unexpressed" to Porter's poignant "Grateful."   The performances are stunning, and the lyrics so simple yet so enlightening and a perfect complement to Bucchino's sweeping music. The orchestrations are supposed to be simple with only the piano as accompaniment, but that is all this CD needs.   These are cabaret songs, and thank goodness this CD has come to showcase the best of Bucchino's work and this talented cast. It would be a travesty not to have this recording. Every song is a delight, with my favorites being:  Unexpressed Sweet Dreams Playbill That Smile Love Quiz A Contact High [Ridiculous, but very clever] It Feels Like Home It's Only Life This Moment Taking the Wheel Gratefu+music
An Impressive, Rockin Debut!+P+Now this is what I call rocking music. I first heard Cheyenne's "One Original Thing" on the movie, Aquamarine, and got hooked on it. I purely bought the CD just for that one song, then found out, there were so many other great ones. "Hanging On" and "Original Thing", title track "Day Has Come", "Everything to Lose", "Mr. Beautiful", "Four Walls" and "Full Circle" are ones worth listening to over and over again. I never get tired of them. 'Hello Goodbye', 'Good go bad' and 'Didn't I' are growing on me-more and more, "Breaking your heart" is edgy along with 'I want to'. This is definitely the type of music to have at a party to dance all night long to, she makes me wanna dance and never stop. This Texan is definitely has a lot of potential+music
Not a very good Christmas album.. except for Clay & Kelly+N+The whole album was really bad. The group did not harmonize well on the ensemble songs. Tamyra screamed her way through Silent Night, a very mediocre version of Silver Bells, performed by Kimberley Locke and Clay Aiken. A boring I'll Be Home For Christmas, by Idol Wannabee, but charming, Justin Guarini had me falling asleep. And Winter Wonderland probably came close to being the worst on the album, but This Christmas, sung by Ruben Studdard beat it. Ruben's charm has disapeared since the show. The vocal performance itself was horrible, but as was the song. What ever happened to Traditional Christmas? I'll have to wait for Clay Aiken's Christmas Album to be released this October.    But the highlights are Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas - A duet by Tamyra Gray and Ruben Studdard, The Christmas Song sung by Kim Locke, and, the best, The First Noel, sung by Clay Aiken. Think I'm being biased towards Clay? By the album and see for yourself.     And of course Kelly was great. She tends to &quot;scream&quot; sometimes, but she did a good job on &quot;Oh Holy Night and My Grown Up Christmas List - there are better versions then her out there, but Kelly is really a great singer+music
"Mom always told me that monsters don't exist... But they do, don't they?"+N+Glam rock died for a reason. All these revivalist compilations need to stop being produced. - Thus says the Pellingto+music
King Holiday info+N+In answer to a music fan from Temple Hills, the song was called King Holiday by the King Dream Chorus &amp; Holiday Crew. It came out on Mercury in 1986 and featured the singers and rappers you mentioned. It made no.30 on the R&amp;B Charts but didn't crossover pop. The lyrics are on the net (try Google) but I don't know if the song still is+music
Nauseatingly syrupy.+N+The "filler" songs on this CD are some of the worst I've ever heard. The lyrics sound like they were written by sixth-graders and the music has no character. I thought I was getting something similar to the unique, gritty sound of The Cranberries, but alas, this is closer to Hilary Duff. Aside from "Rebel Heart" (which is one of my favorite songs ever), I can hardly tell they have any Celtic connection at all!+music
Thriller is still "thrilling" !+P+Best Pop album of our generation..bar none...From the opening snare stabs of Wanna Be Startin' Something on through The Lady In My Life...this collection of songs puts the "magic" in ..you guessed! Magical! Sublime studio musicians, crafty songs and Q's executive duties, and of COURSE MJ's one-of-a-kind vocal/song contributions and least not his incredible mastery of melody and groove..You have not LIVED until you hear this POP masterpiece..Every song shines! Beat It..Human Nature...and Billie Jean..I still listen to this album after 23 years...it's fresh, it's vibrant...and the beats don't stop til you get enough+music
Its like a bad accident, you can't look away..+P+Face it. This was the best damn music to come out of MJ,  audio or video.  Jackson hooking up with Quincy Jones was like ten Lennon and McCartneys and and a couple of Bob Marleys all in one mixmaster. I remember when I first heard this album, thinking "He'll never be able to follow this one up". I was right...like a lot of people who thought the same thing. Everything afterwards just didnt have it. Downhill he went...the rest history. THis CD with SACD to kick its [...] is designed to pop your speakercones right out on to the floor. Thriller,  right off the shelf all those years ago was top notch in sound to begin with, add a bit of remix and some technology and gawd...Vincent Price's voice at the end of it is sooooo real it creeps you out, like it's suppose to. Put all the headlines and  People Magazine articles aside and go back to the early 80's before it all went wrong. Michael was hittin it on all eight cylinders.+music
In my humble opinion -+N+Guys...it's not that GOOD. I have the album on my computer, and I gave it a few listens, but...it has no substance. It's not interesting or anything new. It's catchy. And irritating, after more than a song or two. That's all ("Bandages" is enjoyable once in a while, I will concede).   If you're looking for catchy and poppy (and there's nothing wrong with that), then buy it. If you want something new and original - don't. And if you want good indie dance/electronica-type music go for something like The Faint, The Bravery, or Le Tigre.+music
The Greatest  Rock album of all time  sex, sin, and repdemtion in 40 minutes +P+I have hestitated to write a review on "Purple Rain" for years because   1. I listened to this album for 4 years everyday (1984- 1988) and never  knew what it truly was.  2. In many ways it has made the most profund change in me as a person.  3. Because underneath of it's sexuality is the greatest Christian Rock Album of all times   4. And also the greatest musical statment of the Rock Era.  In many ways Prince and the Revolution's "Purple Rain" was the extension of the classic Sly and the Family lineup (whom he takes probaly his greatest inspiration musically) and their second album together he leaves the Minneapolis Sound somewhat and instead of the Punk/Funk Nu Wave vibes of 1999 he opts for Power Pop like  The Who and The Kinks on songs like "Let Go Crazy" is a classic clash of synth pop with Townsend -like Guitar chrouses but the lyrics start with him either in prayer in a thearpists chair with a traditonal gospel intro talking about the 'afterworld' or insanity (much like Marvin Gaye lyrically at his best)  and with those Minneapolis synths of Coleman and Dr. Fink swirling and vamping about, the song becomes power pop heaven for guitar freaks and the lyrics which captures lust, salvation and insanity with it's perfect guitar solos and the end with it's cathraic release siginals that we are not only listening to a soundtrack but at it's core a Christian Rock Album but it doesn't sound like a Newsboys, Amy Grant or DC Talk album because unlike those groups, Prince talks about the flesh in ways that these artists would never broach on an album.   Side one (I have it on vinyl,cd and tape) after the insanity of Let's Go Crazy is the great pop of Take Me with U with it's great arrangement and while Appolonia is vocally limited, she turns in a great performance on this song and Prince being the great singer could have overwhelmed her vocally but he stays in her range "The Beautiful Ones" The only R&B sounding song on side one, is a beautiful declaration of love to his Girlfriend at the time Susanah Melvion. In his best Smokey Robinson/Curtis Mayfield/Eddie Kendricks falsetto he pleads with great tenderness in verse   "If I told U Baby If I was in love with U  Baby Baby Baby We could Married would that cool  In the last verses he demands she makes a chocie  Do U want him ? Or Do U want me cause I want U Tell Me Baby Do U WANT ME  !!!! I gotta know I gotta Know  Computer Blue is probaly the most Song that is Hendrix/Funkadelic in spirit lyrically and in musical exceution with it's Wendy and Lisa sapphic intro bathing each other into the most insane Prince guitar jam it his sexual id run amuck musically with the lyric "Til I Find the Righteous One Computer Blue" with The Revolution jamming along Prince plays some of the best solos I have ever him play with it's Eddie Hazel - like first solo before the breakdown into a Ernie Isley-like second (whom I think Prince sounds like )melodic solo til the insane ending with him screaming like a banshee then it fades into the most controvesial song on the whole album , "Darling Nikki" (the reason there are Parental Advisory Tags on every album)is about a visit to a hotel to see a girl who was a 'sex fiend'  and a song that while quite tame for today still only gets played late at night because of the lyric mastrubastion.  I always thought the guitars had a Led Zeppelin vibe at the time but as I have listened to more Black Alternative Albums it sounds like Funkadelic in it's prime.  Side Two (I know I am still doing the vinyl thing) is where you really see the Spritual side come out from the opener 'When Doves Cry' a musical and artistic acheivement with it's lack of bassline the song sounds like a sexual peacan about a woman, but it is actually about  hwo one dominates or gives up control in their interpersonal and romantic relationships with really cold and dark lyrics with the lament of "This is what it sounds like When Doves Cry" even when Prince is not singing about sex it bleeds through the lyrics it really is a sad song in many ways but the guitar brillance keeps the song lite. "I would Die 4 U " is a great pop/funk song about faith under the quise of sexuality of God as a woman, a man or something you can't even fathom. Me and my friends couldn't believe at the time Prince was talking about God in all those mainfestions with the chrous "I would die 4 u Baby I'm a Star  is actually the most classic Minneapolis Sounding song with those classic keyboard vamps with that chant "Doctor" with Dr. Fink's great keyborad solo and then the finale of "Purple Rain " in which he takes a Marvin Gaye staple remdemption where he ties but impluses but marries them in a godly realm it is lyrically a double endtree you can say he's talk about himself as a woman's savoiur but it can also be about the power of God into one's life. After watching the movie and concert you realize years later that this album at it's heart is a ode to God and sex like many of his classic albums but it is the greatest Christian Rock album of all time because unlike those Christian Rock bands, they are never in touch with the world they are always trying to run away from those issues in their makes their music nothing but empty platitudes  unlike Prince who like Bob Marley and Marvin Gaye embraced the scared with the profane and came out with a masterwork for the ages.  +music
I'd like to hear it first+N+I ordered this CD on May 19 and I have not yet received it.Please advise as to what to do about this. I know I have been charged and I would like to think this doesn't happen very often.  You might know, the first time I order CD's off the net and one of the 3 doesn't arrive+music
Beautiful, lovely CD+P+I saw Jon Randall play live with Emmy-Lou Harris in Nottingham earlier in the year and was amazed by his angelic voice and his lovely songs. This cd is just wonderful and with some highly talented background singers helping him with bone achingly beautiful harmonies, you can't go wrong+music
hahahaha+N+i wouldn't have such a big problem with rap if they didn't call it music.  that's like calling the teletubbies 'theater'.  a bunch of guys talking to a beat is not music, it's poetry with a rhythm.  and these guys don't give a f*ck what they are writing about, all they care about is the loot.  so f--- all of these rap artists taking up space on the tv and radio.  progressive 4 ever+music
A very deceptive "Greatest" Hits for Whitney+N+Whitney Houston is a nice-looking woman, has a beautiful voice, a good selection of songs... Why her producers have issued this crappy edition of her "Greatest" Hits???...  The first disc is OK, almost all of her best romantic hits ("Didn't We Almost Have It All" and "Saving All My Love For You" plus the main theme for "The Bodyguard" originally from Dolly Parton) are included. The second disc however, is purely another attempt to promote these modern (and weird) DJs that "mix" dancing themes, whose original versions are far better than the mixed versions! +music
voices in the room +P+Nice jazz sampler should appeal to most tastes in mainstream jazz since it's not too funky or free-style.  What's the real kicker here is the SACD quality.  Certainly not what I would call a great test cd but still good for amazing friends with the detailed sonics and tight bass lines and realistic voices in the room effects. +music
Why?+N+This recording is just ok.  I didn't see why she needed to do a cover cd patti is so much better than this and it's not that she is singing the songs just ok it's just that she doesn't add anything different to them to make me say yeah thats it.  make the next recording will be the one i can enjoy until then i guess i will put "flame' my favorite patti cd+music
Very disapointing!!!!+N+I love Patti, and her last cd was one of her most consistant to date. This one is not good at all. This a low point in Patti's career, and God knows she has had enough low points on vinyl and disk. Live performances have been consistantly awesome over the years from what I can see on tv. I really wanted to like this, but "ain't no way" this song should have been remade by Patti and Mary who has a pitch issue. If you cannot do a song justice, don't sing it!!!!! Patti still has more vocal range left than most of her peers, but singing high notes don't "make" a song, interpretation is what makes the listener feel the lyrics. Patti and Mary need to learn that as age will creep up and lower ones vocal register. Patti should have listened to the doctor and waited for this one. This cd came and went, period! I literally gave it away!!!!!+music
Horrible. Just Plain Horrible.+N+As an Amazon reviewer, I have dedicated my account to providing a level-headed review of anything that I have listened to that is worth reviewing. More often than not, I will point out the good and the bad for each album as to give to the minds of those who haven't heard it yet unbiased information as to decide for themselves whether or not to purchase it. However, I believe I have actually found an album that has no redeeming value anywhere on it. Chingy never was very talented, whether lyrically or flow-wise, but at least his first album had a couple enjoyable beats that pushed the limit of synthesizer use, helping make some of the song more listenable. But his follow-up is...well, how can I describe while also being nice...unmitigated crap. There, I used a big word in an attempt to be nice. Even if you're into the whole "cash-money-hoes" pop rap that's been overtaking the mainstream, this album won't do a thing for you. Some of these types of rapper at least incorporate some of their young "hood" life experiences to make it their own, but Chingy, other than his nasaly, thick accent, does absolutely nothing to place his trademark on this album. All that this album offers is more generic "I'm rich so I'll flaunt it until you puke" crap. Worse, the beats are unoriginal and do nothing to add to the "music". I don't even know if you can call this music, as it does not follow any of the guidelines that music sets down. Chingy has no talent and no amount of argument is going to prove otherwise. I can't believe I once even listened to this guy. It makes me sick that people like this guy are the ones that get paid millions of dollars and sell multi-platinum records for showing absolutely no sign of musicianship at all. He and all his fellow rappers should be sent back to the hood and be forced to study music theory for the rest of their lives. And for the love of God, Chingy, LEARN TO SPELL! You're not impressing anyone with your unintelligent songs like "Wurr Da Git It Gurlz At" and "Fall'N". I don't see what's so hard about spelling those right. Here's a short lesson: "WHERE ARE THE GET IT GIRLS?" and "FALLING", My god, you can't even spell simple words right.  Bottom line: there is no reason why you should buy this album. Like I said, even if you absolutely adore rap and hip hop in all its forms, you most likely will not find any songs on here worth listening to even once. You'll just find it covered in dust in your closet years from now and retch with disgust that you actually dropped full CD price for such a worthless waste of materials. For rap that actually warrants more than one listen, try Busdriver or Del Tha Funkee Homosapien, who actually have lyrical prowess and interesting flow. For good music in general, listen to great metal bands like Children of Bodom and Blind Guardian, and maybe even some classical composers like Dvorak and Beethoven. Those artists have/had more creative talent in a single atom than Chingy has in his whole body. This CD gets no points whatsoever. I would also give 0 stars to it, but Amazon has not yet realized that 1/5 means that there's at least a shred of quality on it, but this album doesn't even deserve it.  0/1+music
KISS REVIEW+P+I must give a nod on my site, here, to kiss. since this album is chock-full of the best of kiss, i will thus toss this one into my eclectic mix of a review site, here, of the books, music, and movies i so appreciate - and any song that i recall hearing that literally caused me to turn around and  stare at the radio in wonder at what i was hearing definitely gets a top , all time favorite spot on my site. i think i was washing the dishes when i first heard one of kiss' early, trend breaking records , " love gun ". the stucture of the song, the voice, the sound ;  loved it. also, i recently heard the kiss classic, "beth", playing quietly over the muzak system at the grocery store. that took me right back to the seventies...and i realized that "beth" -as well as kiss -has quite well stood the test of time.+music
Yes, you DO need the 2-Disc Edition.+P+I received the 1-Disc 'Best of Bowie' for Christmas, back when I was just a Bowie novice. With the 18 or 19 song track list, it was a short listen, but covered all of the basics. The problem was; I wanted more. I searched every record shop, EVERY eBay auction, until I got everything OTHER THAN the Tin Machine albums and 'Black Tie White Noise'. I am WORKING on getting those now. I finally came across the best of bowie 2-Disc edition, and boy am I glad I purchased it!  The first extra essential this disc has to offer is the classic 'The Man Who Sold The World'. It was so good, it was covered by Nirvana! I consider it to be one of Bowie's finest; right up there with my all time favorite Bowie song, 'Ziggy Stardust'. It also covers another Bowie essential, 'Life On Mars?'. It's more of a nostalgical piece, the beginning taking place in a girl's dreamworld. He actually performed this with the indie band Arcade Fire. And, of course, it also covers 'Oh! You Pretty Things', which is another classic Bowie song off of 'Hunky Dory'. Other songs that have been put on this album and not on the 1-Disc include 'Sorrow', 'Drive-In Saturday' and the slightly controversial 'John, I'm Only Dancing'.  The second disc is more of the 'present' Bowie. The first track is off of 'Low', which many people title 'technologically ahead of its time'. 'Sound And Vision' is one of the most famous songs Bowie has ever done, because it was featured on BBC (I think...) The title track off of 'Scary Monsters' is also here, thank goodness! It is such a good song and it showcases Bowie's 'Chameleon' technique. I'm also satisfied because 'Loving The Alien' is also on this; it's my all-time favorite Bowie song! It also includes more recent Bowie, like 'Little Wonder' and 'Slow Burn'.  The 1-Disc Bowie is good for beginners, but if you want a real good taste of the most inventive artist in the world, get the 2-Disc edition. It covers more ground than perhaps any other Greatest Hits compilation (with the exception of Van Halen, maybe...). You wouldn't be dissappointed with this purchase. It's a lot better than getting Bowie's albums as a starter, and then not liking them...although I'm sure you would.  It's just that good!+music
This is wonderful!+P+Gene Harris is a true master of his craft.  This quartet makes beautiful music; this group is one of which I want all their recordings (and I'm in process of getting it).  The mood of the music is very uplifting!  The audio signal is clear, as are all Concord Records I've bought.  This quartet consists of Gene Harris on piano (and band leader), Ron Eschete on guitar, Jeff Hamilton on drums, and the late GREAT Ray Brown on bass!  All ten tracks are beautiful, beautiful+music
Blues and  Lamentations+N+Kate sings "Pan Of Biscuts" almost as well as Hedy West cept of corse her guitars no match for Hedy"s great banjo playing. The rest of kates album is even more disapointing.                                               joe+music
A wink is as good as a nod to Rod+N+I'm in the process of confirming the rumour that Rod was being seriously considered for a knighthood until the royal family was accidently subjected to listening to this CD.The rest,as they say,is history. Let's get serious, Every performer of Rod's stature has the right to dress up and sing like a lounge lizard once and awhile. But like every good joke you only have to tell it to the audience once, not three times and counting.The only group that applauded the release of this CD were chronic insomniacs. Rod needs to emerge from the "counting room" of his Graceland mansion in St.Tropeze and get serious about the music instead of the bottom line. Forecasts are not promising. The music industry is abuzz, that his next project under consideration is a tribute album to the legendary Harry Reser and the Clicquot Club Eskimos orchestra. It's being leaked on the web,that through the state of the studio art, Harry's instrumental tracks are being combined with newly created lyrics for many of his best selling tunes. The standouts include,"The Old Town Pump" and"Send Me Back My Honeyman".I have serious reservations concerning the project's success, particularly given the weak performances represented on the American Songbook Vol.3. However,hope springs eternal.+music
Barry Manilow couldn't swing to save the world...+N+Good thing saving the would doesn't depend on weather Barry Manilow can swing. because we'd all be in deep sh*t.  Manilow is not capable of swinging, he doesn't have a swingin' bone in his body.  He sounds like he can't keep up with the ebergy of the band.  Manilow is the last person on earth who should be singing with a big band.  Barley Man Enough just doesn't pull this off.  Too bad..+music
To much country+N+This was just to much country for this parrothead. I liked one song, Piece of Work and that was about it+music
CLASSINESS AND LONELINESS+N+EV3 came in a time R&amp;B tunes didn't gave to much space for funkyness, the deaprture of Dawn Robinson to a supposed solo career didn't hurt the group in the vocal aspect, perhaps, what went wrong in EV3 wasn't the lack of another girl to make the quartet, in fact was the quality production that the group lack of.  &quot;Whatever&quot; the outstanding track of this album, was a slow funky R&amp;B tune that somehow aimed for better airplay that it ultimate received, and of course was the only saveable track. The hole album is influence in that slow R&amp;B beat, not the funky jams of En Vogue that fans were acostume to. Even the highly anticipated ballad produced by no other than David Foster &quot;Too Gone, Too Long&quot; felt in the space of being pure pop, and pretty close too be another flop, but the voices of each En Vogue member shine, specially Maxine's in the bridge part of the song, something that it's caracteristic of EV3 is that was really crowed by filler cuts and really bad ones.  In the name of music the only other joint that can be saved from being lost in creativityless, are &quot;Eyes Of A Child&quot; poppy friendly song.  Despite the singles releases, and the later mention this album was such a dissapointment for many fans that expected a little more from the &quot;Funky Divas&quot; because after this they should be call &quot;The Amazing Boring Divas&quot;+music
Too Much Ballad, Too Little Honky-Tonk+N+I'm a big George Strait fan and was disappointed by this album.  This is not as upbeat as some of his other works, which would not be a problem if the slower pieces matched up well against classics like 'I Can Still Make Cheyenne.'  Sadly, they don't.  Moreover, even some of the upbeat works on this CD were not up to the high standards that Strait has set for himself.  The end result is a CD with a couple of good songs and a lot of chaff.  This CD starts off strongly enough, with a piece called 'If The Whole World Was a Honky Tonk;' this is upbeat and well written (Strait did not write any of the pieces on this album).  However, the album then starts swinging wildly between some outstanding pieces such as 'Texas,' Strait's cover of Merle Haggard's 'The Seashores of Old Mexico' and the hit 'She Let Herself Go' and some substandard pieces such as 'Oh, What a Perfect Day,' the upbeat but uninspired 'High Tone Woman' and the disappointing title track.   By far the worst piece on this CD is 'Good News, Bad News,' a duet between Strait and Lee Ann Womack.  This is a long piece that has clearly been designed to show off Womack's vocal range.  The song feels like it's missing a verse and like Strait really is just along for the ride.    This is a CD that I would only recommend for die-hard Strait fans.  There is not enough solid material for the casual fan or for a true twang aficionado to bother purchasing this instead of waiting for the best pieces to show up on a later Greatest Hits compilation+music
A bit disappointed+N+I went into this a pretty big Golden Smog fan eager for a new effort from the guys.  With Tweedy's songwriting having taken a great upward swing in recent years and with Louris' departure from the Jayhawks, I was hoping we'd see a few more Tweedy gems and some great tunes from the past few years since Louris' "Rainy Day Music" was released.  Now, while there are some really good songs here, nothing really comes close to the "Red-Headed Stepchilds," "Radio Kings," or "Jennifer Save Mes."  The album lacks something but I can't put my finger on it.  It almost sounds like a band that has too MUCH focus.  Considering Golden Smog started as a buncha musician friends sitting around, drinking beer, and goofing off, this album feels wrong.  It doesn't have that sing-along feel (with the exception of possibly one or two songs) that the first couple albums (and even EP) had.  Just a little lackluster and, considering the amount of Louris has his hand in on this one, almost comes off as an album of Jayhawks throw-aways+music
Easy listening...with style+P+It's a really nice album. You can listen to it for hours without getting tired. The style of Morcheeba is unique and is getting better and more sophisticated with the time. I strongly recommend it as an icon of POP music for this 2003+music
Brandon Flowers, the Hypocrit+N+In short, this cd is half good and half crap.  The cd starts strong with catchy guitar, and the obvious sharp synth parts.  The thing that gets me is this bands over popularity with a genre of music that has been around for over 25 years. Frontman Brandon Flowers complains about other successful new wave/postgarage bands success (The Bravery, The Fever, Bloc Party, Moving Units) and that they are "riding on our success".  Meanwhile the Killers go on tour with Depeche Mode after they reach platinum status and for some reason Flowers doesn't take a hint.  He has simply become the Depeche Mode of 2004-whenever this band breaks up (cuz they should). Unfortunately this band has a lot less talent than Depeche Mode, seeing as how Flowers voice is overly futzed with in mastering and he uses a pitch corrector in concert. Plus half their cd sucks and their new cd isn't sounding much better. The new single is awful. Quite terrible.  Now I know this review will get a bunch of thumbs down, but I know that those will be from people who have listened to each single on the radio and know nothing about real music, music history, or probably even how to play an instrument, so it won't bother me.   If you want real new wave alternative rock check out these bands: The Bravery Kaiser Chiefs Moving Units Bloc Party The Fever The Unicorns Wolf Parade The Dove+music
Entirely unclothed emperor parading about embarassingly+N+This is an album the enjoyment of which requires the listener to excuse him- or herself from the very smallest shred of critical intelligence.  The gray &quot;oracular&quot; drizzle spreading dully from the 90% asleep gob of this fatuous ennervated biped drives this listener up a tree.  I'd excuse him, but I have better things to do, like putting my head in the oven.  The degree to which this album is embraced by a loving public strikes me as all the justification a person ought to need to write off the species entirely.  Other than that, thumbs up+music
The Best of KC & the Sunshine Band+N+It sounded like a remix sung by someone else, not at all like the original.  My husband and I were very disappointed and because of it I haven't even opened the other CDs by KC & the Sunshine Band that I ordered.  Don't order this product+music
not the way to experience 311+N+i used to be a rather large 311 fan due mainly to the comparisons to sublime. they are pretty good in my book but i must say, this cd is a weak compilation...one has to understand..each of the albums represents a different 311 universe. being reduced to 2-4 songs off of each album mushed together on one gets old very fast.  start out with transistor or soundsystem if your into reggae-ish sounds..if your into rap rock..go with grassroots and blue album. this cd is a rip off and a cheapened 311 experience+music
the revolution of hard rock+P+If Ride the lightning was the manifesto then this is the revolution of heavy metal. This is one of the greatest musical pieces every written. Over the first three CD's Metallica recorded they changed the way the world would look at heavy meta+music
Covenant: My hardcore industrial introduction+P+Having listened to FLA, Delerium and Assemblage 23, I checked on the similar artists listing and came across Covenant and was intrigued by this name. I decided to purchase this CD through Amazon.com and was impressed by 'Dreams Of A Cryotank' which stirred pictures in my mind of sci-fic and fantasy ideas. And this music did not disappoint me at all. This is a quite long CD with 12 tracks. Track 11 is the extended song called 'Cryotank' and is a masterpiece of elusive industrial beats and sounds mixed with a slow beginning to a explosive end. Other songs to look out for on this momentous album are the songs; 'Shelter' that reminds me of nuclear disaster movies like 'Testament' and 'The Day After'. Another good song is the high tempo 'Wasteland' that should make it to dance lists if remixed properly fairly shortly. Also check out the bonus song on track 12 'Theremin Club Edit'now that's a dance song! A good CD from Covenant from 1999.+music
I'm sorry but this album sux+N+I listened to this album and I actually felt cancer forming in my ear drums. Nelly is wack as hell period. He is the modern day version of MC HAMMER. Take a look at the music he is making now. This album is commercial as hell but when you slide down Nelly's resume it gets even more commercial. I mean how low can you go? Country grammar has some decent beats that get professionally wasted but the number one beat waster in the world. Nelly is the WORST rapper actor to ever walk this earth. What we need to do to people like this is to yank him off stage and tar and feather this klown. Check out real hip hop like Mos Def and Immortal technique+music
Thought it was better...+N+Before buying the album I only heard 1 song. When I heard the hole track list I was disappointed. They sound like a lot of other things that are out there, so If you like the "same" sound over and over again you might like it. +music
Good songs....but good album? debateable+N+She has some rockin songs on here. All her singles kickass and the last song on the album with M.I.A. (i friggin love her) is fire. but then, i start listening to the other songs, ready for a song on the album that is just as good as her singles and i can't find another. All of missy's singles are crazy, but then ui listen to the album, and its like a let down. any song that she sings in makes my stomach churn and some have just annoying beats and repititious phrases. If you really liked Missy's album 'This Is Not A Test', then get this album. but if you are lovin her singles and want some more, just download the singles, don't waste your money on the rest of this album.+music
big disappointment+N+i usually dont add my two cents to highly reviewed music but in this fickle world you are only as good as your last album,and since we usually have to wait half a decade for you to spit out another this makes it worse. Ive seen Sade often in concerts and she has always had a great sound. this album is more pop. If it ain't broke don't fix it+music
CD's the SHIZZLE DIZZLE y'all!!! +P+How can you not love a bunch of guys out to make some real quality latin/rock/jam music? Every one of the band members has talent out the wazhoo. The only criticism I can make is that they toned it down too much for the CD. It's real chill, pre-game type music but when you see them live all you wanna do is grab a fine lady and dance till you wear her sexy latin legs out!! Buy the CD, but more importantly, if they're ever playing near you don't even hesitate to buy a ticket (and make sure you have a date!)!!!+music
I Agree - This is Great for homesick Texans+P+Having grown up hearing this album at summer picnics all over the Texas hill country during the 1970's, I had to get this album to take with me when I leave.  To me, this captures what live music was like in that area during that time.  After having spent many summer nights at places like Floore's Country Store, Gruene Hall and Cibolo Creek, I can certainly feel at home with this album.  Imagine a warm night with cool breezes, cold beer and crickets (whose presence is better heard on the CD of this album...).  Toss in the smell of cedar and live oak with a dash of a musty walls and you're all set!  This album is not to be taken as a top-notch, pristine live recording of a legend playing his hits and the audience roars with wild applause after each.  This is as laid-back as the scene was back then.  And this is a fun show.  I would like to someday hear an expanded version of this show with any more material that might have been performed that night.  Then I'd have to get more beer+music
Buy this, please, and listen to real hip-hop.+P+Del spits brilliant lyrics and produces excellently... the beats of songs merge together as tracks change... El-P makes a cameo... Casual makes a cameo... Prince Paul produces a track... get this album+music
Nice follow-up to Adoration+P+I am a more recent Newsboys fan, so I will not pretend to be able to compare this album with all their previous work. But, Devotion is a nice follow-on to the last album, Adoration. It is not quite as strong in my opinion, but it does have some really good worship songs.  Overall, I think the Newsboys are a strong modern worship band, and they have created some great songs on previous albums. As far as this disk does, my favorite song on the whole album is "Orphan" which I think has a really different sound, and I also like "Devotion", "I Love Your Ways", and "Presence".  Although some may disagree I really do not like their version of "Blessed be your name". I think it pales in comparison to the original, or the version put out by Tree63. I literally hit the skip button everytime this song comes up. I hate to hear a great song ruined.  Having said that, I still recommend this album to any Newsboys fans, or anyone looking for some quality modern worship music.+music
10 years later 2.5 stars+N+Hard to believe it has been ten years since Load came out. Like many Metallica fans I recoiled against it, not because of the songs per say, but the whole image change, the shock of Metallica being on Lollapalloza, the disgust at seeing the arrogant attitudes displayed by Hetfild and Ulrich towrds Metallicas established fan base and the genre of heavy metal in general.It was too much for many people to take, and they rejected Load right then and there.    That said, with 10 years passing by, one can listen to Load is a clear eye(or ear). The fact is that while Load is not up to the previous standards of Metallica, it isint all that bad of an album, and despite the dramatica image change, it isint "alternative", either. What Load is more or less is Metallicas interpertation of 70s style blues based hard rock/metal. Think Black Sabbath, AC/DC, Sad Wings of Destiny era Judas Priest, Deep Purple, Budgie, UFO and Thin Lizzy. It are these influences that are most heard in Load. The mid temp, chunky riffs, the wah-wah pedal drenched solos, simple 4/4 based arrangements. Certarinly a big change from the agressive and also progressive nature of previous Metallica albums(even the Black album still had agressive and progressive influences).    The problem with why Load doesnt work per say is mainly two fold. One, at 80 minuites, there is quite a bit of filler on it. The hard rock/metal groups in the 70s worked with a 45 minuite frame work at the very most when it came to LPs, Load would have been a double LP, and the number of successful double LPs in any genre of rock can be counted on by one hand(the only one I can think of in the hard rock/metal genre is Led Zepplins Physical Graffiti). The filler material really weights the album down. The other problem is the bland, mid range production that Bob Rock gave the album that robbed the guitars of their power.    Some of the songs despite the production shortcomings have held up fairly well over the last 10 years. Songs such as King Nothing, 2X4, Bleeding Me, Aint my [...], Torn Within, the Outlaw Torn and Wasting My Hate are fiarly solid. The problem is the rest of the material is not solid, and still has the lifeless sound. Had Metallica only released one instead of two LOADS, had Metallica had better, more lively production, and had Metallica taken the better tracks off ReLoad such as Fuel, Devils Dance, Unforgiven II and Where the Wild things are, then it very well may have been a near great CD(think 4 stars or A- grade), but alas, Metallica went a different route, and the Loads are still considered a failure overall.    I do not reccomend fans of hard rock/metal purchase the entire Load CD, but the individual tracks I listed for Ipod make for decent rotation material+music
lifehouse for the fit and healthy +P+lifehouse no name face a superb album that features that single that every remembers as "hanging by a moment" don't be fooled into thinking that the calling were doing something new this is the band whom had the deep voice the superb gritty guitars and belting drums and bass too make you deaf  i heard "hsnging by a moment" on vigin radio and my first impressions were sounds a bit like the grunge bands but i loved the song and virgin didn't tell me who it was..so i had to wait about another 6 months until they played it again and i heard them say there name and i thought was "lifehouse" the rock opera pete townsend tried to make but didn't suceeded then i realise this..album is a classic gritty belting heart beating album that struck a chord with me..all the way through and that a strange thing for that to happen... this album features a classic "sick cycle carousel"  "somwhere in between" "simon" with amazing lyrics and a sense of purpose of making music from the heart not just formulated for success  a classic album and i think it was their only album really+music
You've got to be kidding me!+N+This is by far one of the worse things I've ever heard. Right up there with Chingy or Changy or whatever it is. They should be ashamed. It's a miracle that can say "Laffy Taffy" and still show their faces in public. For shame for shame. For the record, D4L, to para-quote your own lyrics, No "I can't do it it like you" nor would I want to. I would never suck so bad. 1 Star here it comes+music
Tennessee Ernie Ford early hits+N+It does not even sound like Ford and the socalled hits I never heard before and I am old enough to have heard all his hits+music
A "Not Necessary" remake - the Originals are better+N+Sorry, I thought this would be a great updated version of the classic SHR music - and I was really disappointed. I don't really understand the point of this album - why "remake" music that was timeless and pretty much perfect in the first place?  I can't imagine my own kids actually learning anything from these remakes (and bottom line, wasn't that the point?)... and listening to "No More Kings" was downright depressing - when SHR has always had the exact-opposite effect!+music
Old Dude?+N+Do Ben Clark's teenage fans realize that he's pushing thirty?  The dude is OLD.  He's not a young jackass, he's an OLD jackass. And isn't it a bit creepy that an OLD dude like Ben tries so hard to appeal to 14-year-olds?  Check out the Lashes MySpace profile.  Creeeeepy!  +music
DISPOSABLE+N+I have good news for the guys in Rooney and Hot Hot Heat: you'll have plenty of free time on your hands these next few months, as Seattle's the Lashes have taken the liberty of recording your new albums for you. Be sure to send them a thank-you card from the beach. I'm only half-joking. Get It, the Lashes' full-length debut, sounds exactly like the aforementioned bands. (Maybe instead of thank-you notes, those bands should be sending cease-and-desist letters.) And while plenty of bands sound like plenty of other bands -- hell, a good chunk of CD reviewing is merely pointing that out -- what's most distressing is that, as a result, the Lashes have no personality of their own.  One minor aside: A buddy of mine teased me earlier this summer during a trip to the beach when I popped in Rooney's self-titled debut for a little driving music. "What is this? Inoffensive pop rock mix #1?" he cracked. My friend has a point, and it extends to the Lashes: the music cranked out by these acts is sunny, hooky and instantly disposable pop that works best when used as, well, driving music en route to the beach. Granted, this is not a crime, but it's hard to get too eager about such ephemeral music.  Every track on Get It -- with the exception of the mid-tempo, string-section aided "Dear Hollywood" -- is upbeat and interchangeable-with-every-other-track-on-the-disc power pop, from the jangly single "Sometimes the Sun", the New Wavy flourishes of "The World Needs More Love Letters", and the bouncy keyboards of "Nate's Song". Trying to differentiate between these songs is like trying to pinpoint the differences between brands of toothbrushes -- they all do about the same thing, with very little variation. I mentioned that there are no actual crimes against music on Get It, but the Lashes are guilty of playing it too safe. +music
Sucks!+N+The music sounds like generic oldschool Eurobeats which is fine.  But the vocals are terrible.  He sounds like the biggest fag in the world.  They're even worse than Eiffel 65+music
Among the most forgettable of Part's oeuvre+N+This ECM disc contains four works from the late 1980s and early 1990s by Estonian composer Arvo Part, performed by the Estonian Philharmonic Chamber Choir and the Tallinn Chamber Orchestra conducted by Tonu Kaljuste. Starting in the mid-1970s and continuing through the era of these recordings, Part composed in a style he called "tintinnabuli" for its bell-like tones. The austereness of the music and the religious titles of many of his works have earned this genre the name "holy minimalism." These four pieces I found these to be the most forgettable of Part's works.  "Te Deum" (1984-1986), dedicated to the music publisher Alfred Schlee, is the oldest piece here. At almost 29 minutes, it is also the longest. A setting of the well-known Latin hymn, "Te Deum" combines choral moments with some striking passages for strings. While I don't care to return to it often, the piece is for me the high point of this otherwise dismal collection.  "Silouans Song" (1991) is an instrumental work inspired by the poem of St Silouan the Athonite which begins "My soul yearns after the Lord and I seek him in tears." It is unmemorable music, sounding like a film score, and covers no interesting ground in its five minutes. "Magnificat" (1989), a ghostly a capella setting of Mary's words after her visitation by the Archangel Gabriel, is similarly disappointing.  "Berliner Messe" (1990-1992) simply baffles me. With a theme like the Mass, one should produce something grand and moving; simply look at what Mozart did with his several Masses or, among contemporary works, Ligeti in his Requiem. Instead, Part gives a dull, lifeless, and barely-audible work that has few redeeming qualities. The "Berliner Messe" was revised in 1996, and that version can be found on the recent Naxos disc.  The booklet contains the text of each of the choral works, along with translations into German, English, and French. It also has many photos of the beautiful Lohja church in Finland where the pieces were recorded. However, like the rest of the Part releases on ECM, there is no biography of the composer or musical analysis, a phenomenon I am beginning to get fed up with.  I have generally been hard on Part's work during this period for lacking any real orthodox sincerity, though his PASSIO of 1982 stands as an important exception. Part really hit his stride during the mid-1990s, when he began to broaden his style and use elements from his Eastern Orthodox faith, a time when he produced his magisterial setting of the "Kanon Pokajanen" pentinence text of St Andrew of Crete. His tintinnabuli works could at best be called merely entertaining instead of truly insightful. However, the pieces represented here are not even that.  If you have never heard the work of Arvo Part before, I'd recommend getting the LITANY or KANON POKAJANEN discs or, if you want to hear music from his tintinnabuli phase, the TABULA RASA disc, all of which are also on ECM. This TE DEUM disc is best left to completists+music
One of their best+P+Definitely their most commercial album and in that sense to most people probably their best. Nothing will ever touch Master of Puppets in my opinion, but from beginnning to end this a top notch album without a single weak track. If you're a diehard metal fan and never listen to anything else, you might want to avoid this one and stick with the pre-black albums. However, if you love a solid hard rock/metal album this is one of the handful that is a must own+music
More Like BAD+N+Let me just say, I'm not a Seattle scenester, I'm not illiterate and I don't like the Lashes.  Sorry!  I found a copy of this EP in the used bin at my local record store so I thought I'd give it a spin - it was only a couple bucks.  Needless to say it's going back to the used bin.  Imitating the Strokes and the Killers is really played-out right now.  What's the point?  These songs are derivative with a capital "D".  The world doesn't need one more moody-looking band with perfectly styled hair doing an inferior version of what's already out there.  The music itself is almost passable but the lyrics are really DUMB!  It's like reading a 12 year-old girl's diary.  Even my friend said "It sounds like these guys are about one year too late."  The Lashes are so derivative and unoriginal I almost suspect they were "manufactured" to be popular.  Absolutely soulless. +music
WTF?!?!?!?!?+N+Remember the days when we were punks and we'd gather 'round the phonograph and listen to some Puccini on the old Edison cylinders? They held up to 4 minutes of music! Count 'em, 4 minutes! Then that hippie opera singer Enrico Caruso came along and all the young punks would listen to him, including myself. He was quite the singer. When I was a young kid though, the only form of music we had were the concerts. I remember seeing Franz Liszt play the piano in concert, quite an amazing virtuoso, and Johann Strauss Jr. conducting his orchestra, those were the days.   Then they came out with those things called grammophones, which were even more modern, if it was even possible. But it was, because then they came out with a new modified version of the phonograph that all the young punks would listen to, lazy kids. I mean, you didn't even have to crank a handle like you had to with grammophones. And what's this, 1 hour, a full 60 minutes of music, on 1 record? Pshaw! 4 minutes of music was all I needed, and I was still pooped out even after that. In my day, it was bed at 4 p.m., breakfast at 2 a.m., then off to the mines. We didn't have 60 minutes of free time.   I have no idea what form of music they have now. Appearently, they came out with a couple other things after the phonograph. Now all I see these days are kids with their fancy eye-pods (?) and MP3, MP4 players, whatever they're called, listening to that "hip-hop" tomfoolery of theirs. You can't even call it music, it's just noise. Well, gotta get ready for bed now, it's almost 3:45+music
Why emo was good once+P+I've had this album forever and it, to me, is an expression of emo when it was: (a) as a term, a much more precise description; and (b) as a body of work, good because it coupled actual musicianship and intelligent lyrical talent to garner such a true expression of raw emotion that to listen was to live that emotion, in a phenomenological sense.  To this day, &quot;the new hangout condition&quot; (from which comes the cd's title) and &quot;today or tomorrow&quot; are favorites of mine.  While my predecessor reviewers are right that this album (and, truly, karate) will never be &quot;amazing&quot;, they can best be described as &quot;honest and true&quot;, which is also valuable+music
Corina!!+P+this band has a cute singer, Corina with chipmunk cheeks. She sounds like Belinda Carlile.  I just want to pinch her cheeks!+music
New, but Bland+N+Don't get me wrong - it is wonderful to have A CHORUS LINE back on Broadway.  It is also wonderful to have this new recording, which is essentially the entire score.  It be nice if "And..." could have made the cut, but the money hungry producers shouldn't be expected to include that.  (Yes, that was sarcasm).    The current revival is a wonderful evening in the theatre - but what makes it so wonderful is only PART of what made it so wonderful the first time around.  Michael Bennett's choreography and direction are brilliant, and they alone are worth the price of admission.  When the show fails, it fails because of the cast.  Unfortunately, most of the flaws have been captured on this recording.  Some of the orchestrations are bland and sound "canned" (just as it does in the theatre.)  The opening number plays at a DEATHLY pace.  Charlotte D'Amboise can't sing.  It just doesn't work.  Get it if you're a collector, but if you're not - save your money.  Get the Original+music
Once again THIS CD SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!+N+I just reviewed the other cd and like i said its a waste of your money. Save your money for something valueable+music
Wonderful album needs remastering!!+P+"The Best of george Harrison" is a wonderful compilation of his best Beatles and post-Beatles hits and songs, but I find myself agreeing with other reviewers on the choice of Beatle songs.  "If I Needed Someone" and "Think For Yourself" could have been replaced with "All Things Must Pass" and "Isn't It A Pity" which deserves to be here even more since the "My Sweet Lord" 45 was a double sided hit with that track.  This would have also tipped the scale more toward George's solo sides, to make a more even handed comp.  Also, this CD has been out forever, it not only needs to be recompiled, but REMASTERED!!  It pales beside the remasters of the original albums.  But if you cannot buy the individual albums, "The Best Of George Harrison" is a decent pick for someone wanting to check out his music for the first time+music
what a waste+N+This CD will no doubt appeal to drunken frat boys and fellow travelers, but to me it's all a waste of what once was a genuinely interesting (though far too self-indulgent) singer. In the old days I could forgive the relentless self-pity about how awful it was to be his father's son, because the occasional great performance came through. But there's no such saving grace here - and the explicit lyrics are just pathetic; we've all heard more accomplished filth from grade schoolers. No wonder Amazon - and most other retailers - are discounting this CD so heavily+music
Scraping the bottom of the barrel+N+As if Toxicity wasnt mediocre enough, this just takes everything that was once good and dumps all over it. Where do we place the blame? Is it Darons poor songwriting skills? Or maybe its the dropping of the once thrash-driven riffs and drums in favor of a more accessible MTV-whitewashed corporate music that everyone and their parents would eat up? Or maybe theirs just no more soul left in a once killer band that was a breath of fresh era from all that nu-metal garbage that invaded the radio and TV?   Whichever one you choose, this is not the SOAD we all love, this is an unoriginal rehash of Toxicity. Oh wow, they have an anti-government song? So what, who hasnt made one of those. And anti-war songs? Travel back to the 60s, they were chock full full of them. Everything I hear is uninspired and downright lazy. Its also unfortunate that Serj got sidelined by Daron "I wish I had talent" Malakian, for he literally tries too hard to make interesting songs, while coming out in the end as those annoying kids that have ADHD in your classroom that are just seriously not funny.  Maybe im being to harsh, but you would be annoyed too if a once great band betrayed their pre-Toxicity fanbase in order to get more money and exposure, and in turn seem hypocritical to their lyrics.  You want to get good music, get SOAD's self titled, its their best and the only one that wasnt corrupted by the capitalist pigs known as MTV. +music
we need more rough cutt+P+It's bands like these that make the 80's shine.Too bad they  did'nt make more releases.What's really sad is that a lot of  rock stations don't even play this.paul's voice is very distinctive,also got his solo stuff.So if you get the oppurtunity buy this and any of paul's cd's.This is elite compared to the likes of kickaxe and black n blue.All in commin with great hard rock and songs that have hooks all over.And to mention they all did'nt make it big,what a shame!+music
Metallica - 'Reload' (Elektra)  2 1/2 stars+N+Review no.618.Somewhat disappointing follow-up to their '96 'Load' CD, which was one of their better works ever,I thought. I remember SO many fans commenting how let down they were when this disc first came out. It's not so terrible,it's just nothing to get all tanked up about. Some of the tracks here,I thought were okay,are "The Memory Remains" (love the video where Marianne Faithfull makes an appearance-now THAT'S semi-original),"The Unforgiven II",the melodic "Where The Wild Things Are" and "Bad Seed". Not the worst metal release I've ever heard,by any means. Take my advise,buy a used copy of this title+music
it's growing+P+the more you listen to this cd the better it gets. it will sink in,just give it time +music
More than a Decent Album+P+I keep reading reviews of Rainbow albums as decent or average, which is an understatement.  While Rainbow never reached the musical heights of Deep Purple, the band was, in it's own right, influential in creating the gothic hard rock sound that so many derivative 80's English metal bands embraced.  I admit that I AM biased in Blackmore's favor, but that's because he is THAT good of a guitarist and quite underrated.  Listen to each song, but don't waste your time on "If You Don't Love Rock and Roll," which elicits about as much emotion as watching lichens growing on rocks.  However, "Man on the Silver Mountain" and "Self Portrait" are 70's metal classics+music
macabre jazz at its finest+P+Its difficult to determine where to begin when describing "Submariner".  This is one of the most richly layered albums I have ever heard, not only that, but there are only three members to The Dead Science.  To start off, the brothers Bischoff and vocalists Mickens started off as a arty jazz ensemble hitting the clubs in the Seattle area.  Its clear that that jazz background permeates the album but putting your finger on who to compare THIS style of jazz to is very challenging.  When one thinks modern day jazz influenced musical acts with dark overtones, a wide variety of artists that may range from Portishead to Nostalgia 77, maybe even Soul Coughing may come to mind.  Whats amazing is that each one of these bands/artists have left traces of their jazz lineage DNA, and yet they sound nothing alike.  The same is the case of The Dead Science's Submariner.  This Album stands apart though by being surprisingly organic.  No scratches, no samples (not to say there's anything wrong with those, but) this is an album that relies on its craftsmanship.  Let's take track # 7 for example.  The song is called Threnody, which literally means song of lament, sometimes used in funerals.  This threnody called Threnody would be the best ambassador to Submariner as there is a collective of seemingly sporatic jazz improve.  Upon closer listening though, one would be able to glean that this is as simultaneously horrifying and beautiful as a Giger metamorphasis.  There is no conflict of musical elements as a double bass vamping is followed by flat rapid precussion artistry, which is needle-and-threaded with lyrics like "Corpses buried on the banks of the Mississippi river" and "Cell wall divisions corroding under falsities". "Below", "White Cane", and "The Ghost Integrity" are also very strong points to this album, although every song works well together as a well oiled submarsable.  +music
letdown+N+the first album was so good - walking the fine line between cheesy pop and beautiful sentiment. this one is just all cheese. the guitars have been replaced with 80's (the bad 80's) sounding synthesizers and the hooks, which may still be there, are just buried under layer after layer of production. i can't even believe this is the same band. i played it for several friends who i turned on to the delays without telling them who this was. the reception was..uh..not good+music
Boring and repetitive+N+This guy gets two stars since he is one step above a street performer.  His music is a bad resurrection of old-style Blues from the South.  He gets more popularity he deserves, but thats true for most mainstream artists of the 2000's+music
Band was so bad, singer killed himself+N+This band's stated agenda was to create good old pop music, the kind you used to hear on the radio in the 1960s and 1970s. Unfortunately, their execution was lacking. Their singer and songwriter had next to no talent. His best work was singing with Liz Phair on a cover of "Turning Japanese." And even that was hollow and soulless. Then he killed himself and nobody cared except maybe close personal friends and relatives, but maybe not even them if they'd heard this record. It's that bad+music
impulsive?+N+i bought this record i don't know why. i heard a few tracks and thought it sounded ok. i listened to it once and it sounded so blase. i don't really know what i expected. i have add so sometimes lyrics don't really matter-- the rocking of the music does, which may be why i like jazz so much, because it doesn't have words. neither here nor there. any way: and yes i know this isn't really much of a review: i think this is a record the casual observer may pick up for whatever reason and thrust aside. i think this is one that one must make a conscious effort to listen to and appreciate for what it is. first listenl-- not impressed. but give it a chance.+music
"Tallahassee Pain....in the @$$"+N+Let me just say that, while I don't own the album, I did buy it for my wife. She loves it. That doesn't say too much for her taste in music, though. She also loves Akon...  I was born and raised in Tallahassee. I listened to an interview that this overly-cocky s.o.b. gave, where he called all the artists in t-town crabs in a bucket, and that he had to struggle and fight to make it out. That he was the first artist to ever make it big out of the Capital City. There are a couple of issues with that. Like mainly the fact that he wasn't first, or even in the top 5.  You may have to go back a little ways, but all you really need to do is check out a Dead Prez song called (of all things) "Tallahassee Dayz". stic.man himself went to Rickards High School on Tally-ho's South Side. So, he (T-pain) needs to get his history straightend up first before he decides to go on national radio and embarrass himself (again, and again, and every time they play his damn songs).  Oh, three more things: 1) That video he claimed he shot in Tally was shot in ATL, 2) I wouldn't have given this any stars if I could've avoided it, and 3) I don't know WHAT he's talking about, but there ain't no strip clubs where I'm from..+music
bad singing+N+the beats are hot as fu*k but the singing is just terrible. the beats are crazy on this disc but t-pain cant sing for his life at all. you can tell his voice is all metallic on his songs. but two stars for the beats. the lyrics aren't very good either+music
50 cent and ja rule need to be deported from the planet+N+Why do you all still support this clown? Ja rule hasn't been hot since his first album. Then he let a clown just as wack as him crush his career. Ja rule is as commercial as they come and his lyrics display that. He is all about the money and not about making good music. This is a very poor release. It is just as wack as dem franchise boys and d4L. Jefferey needs to stop rapping and go rob a bank like steady b+music
Another must situation for zero stars+N+As if the song for mesmerize was'nt bad enough. A F***'IN GREASE VIDEO???!!!! Ja officially became a diva with this album. This album is horrible. The pledge had some life due to Nas appearance, thats why it's hard for me to request a zero star rating. Bottomline if Ja's body was made up of his albums, this part would gangrene, maggots would avoid this and you should too+music
Baduizm+N+nothing to write home about.  Lot of rap style rifts but nothing that challenged her vocally. +music
Is this really Brian Stokes Mitchell singing?+N+I eagerly awaited this album, ever since hearing Mr. Mitchell sing in the Kiss Me Kate CD. His singing in Kiss Me Kate is unbelievably gorgeous, with his lustrous baritone nuancing every phrase and word. The singer on this CD is hardly recognizable as the same singer. The timbre of the voice is not the same, Mr. Mitchell is trying to sound like a lounge singer, not the magnificent Broadway star he is. I hope he does another album, the next time bringing to life great Broadway songs in the style of his Kiss Me Kate and Man Of La Mancha performances.+music
a dissapointment+N+Don't get me wrong, I love Brian Stokes Mitchell. His deep voice is intoxicating and beautiful, which was why this CD was such a dissapointment. All his songs are high and do not show off his wonderful low voice. Mitchell should stick to what he does best and it is not covers of songs made for tenors. I hope his next album will be more fit for his voice, I'll be the first in line+music
He does it again!+P+Two Lights by Five for Fighting is probably his best work so far.  I highly recommend buying this CD+music
Bizzy Fell Off Biggg Time!!!!+N+Man, what to say about this album.  First off Bone Thugs are overrated, they're good but not great.  Creepin on ah come up, e-1999, and art of war being their best material.  Resurrection, and thug world order are nothing special.  Maybe the biggest issue they have is finding at least "decent" beats.  Creepin, and e-1999 had that rough rugged gangsta sound.  Their later efforts have imo really wack, and soft somewhat commercialized beats that they never seem to fit with properly.  Bone brothers is another example of this.  Art of war also had some decent beats but way too much soft stuff that doesn't properly portray their image.  As a whole Bone thugs have that special recipe, as solo artists they just don't cut it.  Krayzie's solo albums have A FEW good songs, the rest being filler junk!  Layzie, does not belong as a solo artist.  Bizzy can't pull it off either.  As a group they can write blazing lyrics because there is four of them so their verses aren't all that long and come out golden.  But doing a whole song, OR ALBUM by themselves they sound half @$$ed!  On art of war Bizzy had developed his hyperspeed flow.  Now he has given up that flow for his new funky supa WACK sometimes slow, sometimes kinda quick, but losta garbage singing flow.  BIZZY STOP SINGING, u sound like trash!!!!!  This album suffers from Bizzy's wack flow, and super generic wack beats.  It's funny how people say Bone is better than Twista.  Yeah I'll admit it, not since his Tung Twista days was Twista able to outflow Bizzy (art of war verses), but u know what when it comes to a more CONSISTENT flow, and understandability Twista wins hands down.  Bone (especially Bizzy) changes their flow up too much in a SINGLE song and sing too d@mn much!  And this album (plus all the other bone solo releases) shows why it takes a GROUP effort to outshine one man (twista) on an album.  As solo artists NO bone member can hold down an entire album by themselves, Twista can!!  Where is bone now???  Twista is at the top of the game, and bone fell off long ago+music
Come Fly With Me+N+Clarity of CD and DVD not good compared to "Caught In The Act+music
CATCHY pop punk+P+the huntingtons are the best band around today... and this is their best release! they bring a certain element of songwriting that no other band can duplicate.. they are funny lyrics but they also mean something unlike many  other bands. The guitars stick in your head all day and it doesnt even  bother you! There should be 20 stars for High School Roc+music
Get over yourself, fat boy+N+Just who wants to hear Van Morrison complain like an old ninny about the press, or the pitfalls of being a godlike, mythical celebrity trapped by his own legend and fame--and all of it contained in bland rocking-chair Muzak jazz. Three chords and some bad lyrics and right away they come on with a messiah complex. (You fans and your empty lives are partly to blame for all this.) "I just want to sing my songs," he whines. (Who's stopping you?) John Waters once said: if you want to be left alone, pick up a monkey wrench and fix toilets and stay out of show business. Besides, I didn't know Van the Man was all that famous. Does anyone under 50 know who he is? I sure haven't seen any articles in the paper about him lately. Old hippies might still babble about "Into The Mystic" and his performance in "The Last Waltz." I heard him sing "Gloria" on an oldies station the other day and I went straight for Rush Limbaugh. Are the royals in England so desexed these days that the Daily Sun has to write up Van Morrison to this degree of musical paranoia?+music
Going through the motions+N+This isn't as bad as the garbage tracks Morrison did to get out of his Bang recording contract (nothing like &quot;Ringworm&quot; in this collection), but this is not even a mediocre Van release. I like most of his releases, even COMMON ONE, INARTICULATE SPEECH, and BEAUTIFUL VISION. Here, Van just seems commited to getting the &quot;product&quot; out on time. DOWN THE ROAD was much stronger, and DAYS LIKE THIS+music
New dimension for underrated singer-songwriter+P+Joseph Arthur has been quietly gaining a deservedly fine reputation for his emotionally raw, yet very well crafted songs. Breaking away from the RealWorld label, where he released the excellent 'Come to Where I'm From' and 'Redemption's Son' amongst others, he has added a richer more polished layer to his honest lyrics and affecting music.  None of the tracks reached me as immediately as favourites, such as 'In the Sun', 'September Baby' or the beautiful 'Honey and the Moon' but soon enough a few gems appear. 'Echo Park' and 'A Smile that Explodes' are standout tracks in an album that rewards the listener throughout. His vocals focus on the higher register more than past outings, which is refreshing, but this is as characteristic and interesting as ever. Some tracks may be more geared towards an American audience, such as 'Leave Us Alone' but there is plenty to keep the British listener entertained, too.   Appearing on lauded soundtracks such as the OC and Shrek 2, and supporting REM, his unique style and gravely voice have already won him quite a few fans but this new album should see that growth continue. Recommended.+music
HORRIBLE GARBAGE!+N+i can't believe that they got a major label deal based on this album. if you want some GOOD mcr check out three cheers for sweet revenge. that's a good album. don't get me wrong. i love this band. but this is just crap. there are no melodys...it sounds like it was recorded in  one of the band member's bathrooms..and it's just heavy guitars and screaming about vampires and other hogwosh. skip this detour. i can't believe i bought this album hoping it would grow on me. it hasn't+music
Best of the best+P+The Beastie Boys are the best out there. And this is their best album. 20 songs that are all unique.  Best Song: Pass The Mic Other great songs: Gratitude Finger Lickin Good So Watcha Want Stand Together Pow The Maestro Professor Booty In 3'+music
At Last was disappointment +N+Turns out I purchased this cd for one song.  I was very disappointed with the rest of the cd.  The song At Last is wonderful but one song is not worth the price of the entire cd+music
Poorly done album+N+Did not like this album at all.  Poorly written and musically a failure.  No wonder this guy trashes other artists+music
Allison Moorer Getting Somewhere+N+I was so disappointed when I heard this CD. The background music overpowers Allisons voice. If I had heard this before I bought it, I would have passed on it. I can't say anything good about it.  Thanks OV+music
Best album ever+P+This is the best album ever. Rainbow gets heavier and faster on this album and just improve overall. Dio's vocals are out of this world and Blackmore's guitar playing is incredible. Every song on the album is a masterpeice. Tarot Woman is a fast power metal fantasy song, Run With The Wolf is a slower fantasy song, Starstruck is a fast neo classical song, Do You Close Your Eyes is a radio friendly rock song with a catchy riff and catchy chorus, Stargazer is an epic, power metal, neo classical metal masterpeice and the best song I've ever heard, A Light In Tbe Black is another epic power metal song which continues the Stargazer story execpt much faster this time, there are 2 long solos one is a keyboard solo and one is a guitar solo. Stargazer is the best song I've ever heard and the rest are classics aswell. Every musician on this album contributes there best performances ever on this album. This is by far the best album I've ever heard. Fans of Rainbow, Deep Purple, Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, Elf, Dio, Stratovarius, yngwie Malmsteen, Hammerfall and metal and rock in general will love this as you can see from the other reviews+music
No Blood, No Sugar, No Sex, No Magik!+N+I was never much of a Chili Peppers fan over the years, but I thought I'd give them a chance and listen to this disc.And just as I always thought, it's crap. Very few bands have been able to pull off the repulsive people/repulsive music combo as thoroughly as these guys have. I feel like I need a bath after just looking at their picture. As far as the "music" is concerned, the singing is awful(deadpan monotone voice), the instrumentation is very limited, and the overall production is 2nd rate. The ONLY plus, if any, is that the band manages to show some progression on the newer material, which is still not very good. The fact that this band has been successful over the years just proves that a lot of people have REALLY bad taste.         +music
I agree - don't buy it+N+So I'm not the only one who feels ripped off!  I was so angry when I played this (on an excellent system and at a decent volume) and discovered that many of the tracks are (poor) live recordings.  Like so many artists, he has passed his prime and his concert performances are but a pale imitation of the original recordings; and it is those original recordings his fans remember and expect. I was so angry I was tempted to write to Neil and complain. Unlike one of your unhappy reviewers, I did not even have the benefit of a sticker warning of the live tracks. If you're a real fan of the man, don't buy it.+music
mix of moods and movement+P+Purchase this CD - don't hesitate. This album with make you tap your feet and clap your hands.  It's up, down, spin around. Their own unique sound splashed with hints of other artist influences.  Instant gratification once you hit play!  A blender of the Rentals, Concretes, Velvet Underground, Cure, Psychadelic Furs, Snow Patrol, Mercury Rev, Belle & Sebastian, Ride, Wedding Present, and Spiritualized+music
Good Music however the Title is Technically False.+P+There is some good music on the two discs. The first one collects most of Paul and Wings hit singles whilst the second are some personal selections from Paul, where some gems can be found such as "Too Many People", "Tomorrow", "Daytime Nightime Suffering" and "Maybe I'm Amazed". Some of the material on the second disc is a little slight and there are many better songs that could have been selected.  The main issue is that these songs are not all technically Paul McCartney and Wings, alot of them are Paul and Linda, Paul on his own, is its not a true representation of strictly Wings, currently Wings Greatest is just that.  Having said that You can't go wrong with the great catchy pop rock on this album. It is good to see Wings get more coverage, beneath the Beatles they really are getting some respect for the great band they were+music
Cheesy, corny Gothic-wanna be+N+Midnight Syndicate wants to be a lot, I guess. It wants to be dark and scary, but they're more like a graphic vampie novel, you can admire the technique but you don't really get involved. The images they produce remain a bit plastic, static, with an overdose of well-known themes.   Twenty one short tracks, too short really, are offered here, with a not-all-to-believable-and-scary voice talking: "Born of the night, they lurk in the shadows...Gargoyles of living stone, lost souls who wander mist shrouded cemetaries, and vampires who dwell deep within forbidden crypts... Creatures of the night, they arise as darkness descends..." Can lines about things that hide in the dark be even more cheesy?   Then some strings are touched like guiter wires and this sounds rather good. A heavy churchbell starts humming, dark but single layered ambient creeps in. But  it's all still too obvious, and more and more I get the feeling this is some sort of "starters kit for Gothic fans".   You want effective, deeply seeded dark ambient that really knocks the light out of you, try "Within the depths of silence & phormations" by Raison d'Etre or any of  Lustmord's solo albums "Heresy" or "The place where the black stars hang". But of course, giants in the dark ambient world like Lustmord or Raison d'Etre don't really mess with vampires and Gargoyles and bombastic electronic sounding choirpulp. And because of this, there will still be an audience for an act like Midnight Syndicate.  I just hope that M.S. will evolve more, make less tracks, and the ones they do make, should be stretched out more, giving them a chance to get more layered and filled with more depth than they are now.  Track three, the title track, offers a truely menacing piano tune, but because the composers don't seem to know what to do with it, they just keep on repeating it. And after a short three minutes the track is over. And "corny humming number four" starts. So what?+music
Is My Stereo Broken?+N+First of all, let me qualify this review by stating up front that I have been a DM fan since its inception and think that the band has single-handedly influenced a whole generation of musicians. That being said, I think this album is a symptom of a much larger problem with the band: a real lack of vision and originality.  On the good side, many DM diehard fans will like the majority of the tracks because it reverts to familiar fodder - dark lyrics with machine-driven rhythms. On the bad side, it's all too familiar stuff with  beats that could have been lifted from earlier efforts. The only real difference is that the tracks on "Angel" sound like they've been fed through a fuzz-box.   The first time I listened to this disc, I thought I had blown-out the speakers because the drum tracks clipped and everything else sounded distorted and fuzzy. I soon realized this was intentional, but had to ask myself, why? "Exciter" was experimental, but a truly drained effort. This album sounds like a pale imitation of Bjork. They even copied the toy piano and music box stuff like on Bjork's "Vespertine" album. The difference between Bjork and DM is that Bjork knows how to use weird sounds to enhance a lyric and create a musical mood. This album just sounds like conventional mid 80's DM music that was fed through badly recorded effects.  I really could feel the creative slide with this band when "Ultra" was released, but this record confirms what I have sensed for some time. The band has really struggled to achieve artistic relevency since the departure of Alan Wilder. Martin Gore is a musical genius, but he has limitations when carrying 90% of the musical vision and writing. I really think Gore needs an intellectual foil to conterpoint and challenge his ideas. Unfortunately, this album sounds more like a Gore solo effort than a true DM product and as a result, the music has greatly suffered. Gone are the famously catchy hooks and relevant, edgy lyrics. Here comes the gloomy ballads with headcase-jilted-lover lyrics (yawn). A new member or creative colaborator in the band would inject some fresh ideas into their music or I fear this may be their last record.  Word of advise: although this album does show some promise at times, your best friend here is iTunes. Download "Precious" and preview the rest of the record before making any additional choices. You may find it very hard to find another tune worthy of keeping on your iPod+music
The Rock Gods Smile+P+If you play this CD in reverse it says "Jesus is Satan."  Comets on Fire are dense.  Blue Cathedral was a punishing wall of noise.  Listening to it I felt like one of those explorers in the black and white Tarzan movies equipped with a machete inching through the foliage.  However, once you carved out your own path the album rewarded you tenfold.  Comets are unapologetically classic rock, but instead of just breaking out the old Hendrix and painting by numbers they added some proto-punk and an echoplex.  Some thought Blue Cathedral was more attitude than it was songwriting, and to them Avatar is the perfect rebuttal.  Here the Faces riffs and Robert Plant vocals are slowed down to further reveal the songs to the point where someone who hated Blue Cathedral might actually like Avatar.  Don't worry, there's still use of the echoplex, and the songs are drawn from six to eight minutes in length (with one exception), but Comets have traded in some of their feral energy for a more dynamic sound.  Benefiting the most from the new dynamics is the bad acid sounding "Lucifer's Memory," a song that sounds like a flower wilting.  There's a certain cadence that plugs along with the chugging vocals pushing the song towards its seven minute mark.  It has quickly become my favorite new song of this year.  While there are still some rockers, such as the opener "Dogwood Rust" which sounds as if its beginning should be found somewhere before you pressed play, just as the closer sounds as if it ends before the song has stopped, even these rockers sound less brutal than their predecessors.  Only "Holy Teeth" has the same long-haired head banging attitude as Blue Cathedral, and it only lasts three minutes (only a minute in Comets on Fire time).  At almost nine-minutes "Soup Smoke" pushes the limits of pseudo-tribal beats.  Instead of punishing noise Comets are pounding repetition into our heads.  Just thirteen more seconds and I think I would have had a spiritual vision.  At only six minutes long the closer "Hatched Upon the Age" proves that it takes more than just length to be epic and more than just noise for a crescendo.  The miracle of the album is that through all of the interplay between the instruments sometimes it's just a couple of simple repetitive piano keys to bring it all home.  Avatar is easily one of the best releases of '06.  Very few bands can bring me back to that feeling I got discovering classic rock bands in middle school.  But don't break out your eight tracks and dust off the old bong yet.  Unlike most bands, retro is only half of the story for Comets on Fire.  Comets on Fire are ultimately timeless.  Try as I might, I cannot lump them with all the other seventies rockers, but their sound hardly seems contemporary.  It's as if they've found some time wormhole so they can rock on across the ages.  I'm there, man, I'm there+music
Not his best+N+Tim has had better albums. Personally I'm not crazy about thuis one. It's my least favorite+music
Very entertaining+P+I didn't think that I was a Beck fan, but I happened to hear this when a friend was playing it in his car and was instantly drawn into it.  I have been playing it frequently ever since.  It is the first CD I have ever owned that has anything akin to rap or hip hop and I just really like how he blends it into so many other styles to create a complete feeling of a musical environment.  I will be delving into some of his other CDs in the future+music
Another band that sounds the same as all the others (sucks)+N+well the band sounds like a yellow card,simple plan,panic at the disco,all american rejects etc. ALL of the bands have the same sound and music that a person from 10-17 would buy. And you proboly saw the video before hearing the song on the radio. If your older 18 and up. you need to get in to some GOOD music. Try the ramones, the offspring, sex pistols or even green day.   +music
The 5-star reviews are complete bull+N+Does this band even know how bad they sound? This is the same generic emo c r a p as AFI, Green Day, and My Chemical Romance. They think they're SOOO clever with the song titles. Yeah, right. Song titles don't need to be 1,500,000 words long. By the time they get the titles out in the refrain, the song's over. as I have said, don't waste your time or money.  Chrissy: Call me out if you must, but I really don't give a rat's a.s.s. what you think of me. To try and derail all the people with common sense is pathetic and childish. PS: "Clueless whiner!" Re: Interesting comment, considering you spent nearly all of your "review" bitching about other people. Who's the whiner now+music
The downfall of Fall Out Boy...+N+This might be a "great" cd to some people, and it might be good in your eyes, but it is blasphemy to GOOD MUSIC. Why don't you guys try bands like Black Flag, The Sex Pistols, The Misfits, maybe even my personal favorite 90's grunge, i.e. Nirvana. Fall Out is so whiny, I'd like to give a thumbs down, for the future of good music don't buy this cd+music
oh, wow, another band with just 2 members ...+N+Somebody call Queens of the Stone Age and tell them that Death From Above stole their equipment ... and their licks. Is there room for another QOTSA? Probably. What I'm wondering is why this isn't found all over cheeseball commercial radio stations. But then, this isn't quite the adolescent, swoon-inducing caterwaul of, say, sickly sweet dollboys Fall Out Boy or the faux-heavy attention-spanless swill of mascara-dowsed cherubs Hawthorne Heights. Death From Above, while not at all mind-expanding, truly is heavy and heavy is not light, and light is bright and bright light breeds happy thoughts and happy thoughts are a preteen girl's wet dream. So, while it's a perfect match for formaldehyde-smoking jocks and tuba-sized bong-owning dropouts, it doesn't quite fly with the doll-collecting crowd. And who knows, I haven't seen what the band members look like; maybe they all have buckteeth, receding hairlines and crossed eyes and that's why they didn't get a TRL invite.+music
I Enjoy It More Than My Son+P+I purchased this CD for the daily car trips around town when my son is with me.   Most every track has characters talking, giving intros to the letters and such.  All very cute, very Seasame Street - and 100% a stroll down memory lane.  I'm not sure if it's all in mono, but most of the songs are from way way back - probably 70's and 80's.  I get a kick out of it because it's nostalgic; and my son enjoys it because he gets to sing along and learn the alphabet+music
Genius at work: Caution to those without taste+P+There is no type of music in the entire world that can prepare you to experience Aesop Rock's "Float". And that's the way it should be. Float is the most unique, in-depth, and complete look into the mind and thoughts of a master of his trade that I have listened to. Blockhead, and Aesop himself, create some of the darkest, most incredibly tangible beats that I have ever heard in my life and I just can't get enough of it. If you finally manage to digest and appreciate the cryptic beats then worry not, the lyrics will keep you busy for years to come. The sheer volume of words is tough to decipher as presented, but combined with his winding analogies and metaphors, it is nearly impossible to understand it all. That is more of a compliment than it seems as I could honestly listen to this entire CD without attempting to understand a single word, just simply being engrossed by the perfect harmony between his vocal inflections and his beats is enough for me. To be able to visually read Aesop's lyrics while listening to him takes him to a level no one will ever approach again. If someone like Sage Francis (the closest to Aesop as I've seen) tickles your fancy then give Aesop a try, I promise he won't disappoint+music
DA BOMB!+P+Intro-this intro practically screams The Godfather but it alwayz makes me laugh!  So Good-I always really loved this song. It really talks about the people that never really beieved them. I always thought of this song as a single. 9/10  Bills, Bills, Bills- Another great single from Destiny's Child. The music video is really good and funny! 8/10  Confessions- In my option, Im not really into this song. I mean i like the lyrics but i'm not into the beat. i sometimes skip this. 6/10  Bug a Boo-Great Single! When it first came i really loved this song and i still do!! In the music video I don't get it when the go to the marching band or whatever.. 8/10  Temptation-A sweet sexy song. It's really good for a slow song about being tempted. 8.5/10  Now That She's Gone-Same option like Confessions. Love the lyrics don't know about beat though. I don't skip it as much though 7.5/10  Where'd You Go?-Really love this beat and lyrics!! Sweet song about finding her man. 8/10  Hey Ladies- I love this song!! Great single for us women. I kinda wanted this to be a single. I can imagine the music video.. 9/10  If You Leave-I love the duet between Destiny's Child and Next! it's really loving and sweet 9/10  Jumpin Jumpin- LOVIN THIS SONG!!! Hot club song!!!! It's pratically impossible to not dance!! 10/10!  Say My Name- I LOVE THIS SONG EVEN MORE!! great beat and lyrics! I havev't met anyone who hasn't heard this! 10/10!  She Can't Love You-Loved this song as well! it's a beautiful and talks about a girl telling her ex that he girlfriend was love wasn't as godd as hers. 9.7/10  Stay-this song is great as well!! Great vocal cuz you can actually hear everyone's voices. I don't why but I can imagine Mariah Carey singing something like this 9.5/10  Sweet Sixteen- I'll tell you the truth i'm not really into this song. The lyrics and melody I don't why I'm not into it...maybe because I'm not 16! :) 7/10  Outro Amazing Grace-I love these vocals!!! It show that they can sing great even withoust any beats!! 9.8/10  +music
It's not what I've got used to+N+"Get Used to It" and "We won't stop" are TBNH releases that share the same category: boring music. Where's the energy? Where's the passion and love? Where's the catchy music? How I miss TBNH from Shelter and Brother & Sister!!+music
Try this idea for the Yank market, Jon+N+Don't offer this release as an album and make us buy an overpriced CD single with it to get the Christmas disc. Instead, bring the "3 Ships" album back out with however many of these songs will fit as "bonus tracks". From what most customers are saying here, this release was a dud. Fortunately I still have the LP version of "Ships" that they really seem to want. Today I dug it out, made MP3s and burned that to a CDR. Which I will gladly destroy when I see "3 Ships (bonus tracks" show up here for me to buy. This may be non-PC, but can I get an Ay-men?+music
Truly Great Album+P+I love this Album. Thats all. Anyway I can not stop listening to this CD. I listened to this only CD for four straight hours on a roadtrip. I still am not tired of this CD. Theres still little lyrics I have missed. If someone reading this does not buy the CD, there is seriously something wrong with you. Because its  the best CD ever.+music
Please make it stop!!+N+I read recently that Sheryl Crow's song "Good is Good" a song from her new album, was nominated for a Grammy award. Seriously,how much time and effort could it possibly take to come up with that. TNMC, also won a Grammy when it was released. I still can not understand why, but I do have a theory. Simply put, the music industry is more interested in image than musical talent and integrity. While only a mediocre talent at best,Sheryl Crow is deified. I realize that this is only my opinion(and I have a right to state it) this type of music nauseates me. There is so much music throughout the world to be explored and appreciated. Do not let some in the music industry to bombard and assault you with this type of musical drek. I do have a solution: all the record producers and industry personnel responsible for the above-mentioned "crimes" should all be sentenced to a jail term for however long it takes them to recognize true talent and get some "SOUL." Peace+music
music in the movie+P+great music. great movie.  when they enter the garage for the first time, before the first race, what is the music playing, any direction would be greatly appriciate+music
Very boring+N+I've been wanting to see this movie and I finally did on LOGO. I'm just happy I waited untill It came on TV. I though it was going to be way better considering what reviewers everywhere said about it. The romance was slim to none. I thought the other guy on the cover was going to have a bigger role. Well, I won't say too much without destroying the movie for those who have not seen it. Anyway, I would much rather watch Beautiful Thing, Get Real, All Over the Guy & The Incredibly True Adventure of Two Girls In love+music
no, no, No, No, NO, NO DAMMIT!!! (Slams linear book down in fustration) (Rating 4 out of 10- -2 stars)+N+Hey, I love the West Coast, as well as California (hope to live there one day). I believe that they can come with the most creative hip hop in the game, and try to support anything that they do. But you do not know how mad I am at this album! When I heard The Dogg Pound was comming with a new album, I couldn't wait to cop it, because comming from some veterans from the west coast (my favorites I might add), I had HIGH expectations from this. This was a very dissapointing album. I guess the flaws are right in my face.   I really don't want to accept the fact that the West Coast fell off, and I keep beliving that they're going to get back on their feet, but this keeps sending me a few steps backwards. Basically the spotlight reviewer "Constant" made the perfect statement about this album. This trio's rhymes skills have been kinda bad lately like on the song "Sittin On 23's". It's like each member tries to rhyme, and they do okay at some points, but fail most of the time. Songs like "Hard On A Hoe" & "Fake***hoes" are just horrible. The album name "Cali Iz Active" you'd think that they would bring as many west coast artists on this album, but they didn't. Lady Of Rage, RBX, Nate Dogg, and Ice Cube appear on this, but the fact that David Banner, P. Diddy, Pall Wall are on this damages the albums image. Also as many reviewers have stated, they're rhyme style hasn't really changed since 1992. Now thats a huge problem.  There are some good tracks on this here, and when I say "good", I mean they barely pass as listenable. I believe the self titled track "Cali Iz Active" was a good one as well as how they brought all the artists from the west in for the video shoot, as I hoped that it would be like that on the album. Although many of the beats are not west coast like, they are still a little nodding like "Keep It Gangsta" although Lady Of Rage outshines Kurupt and Daz. "It's All Hood" is one of those "good" songs on here (as I meantioned what I meant by "good").  Overall, this is not a good album. To me this is a HUGE dissapointment. I denied my self and kept believing that this is a good album, but as I heard it over and over again, it got worse and worse. If anyone remembers when the West was on top of the rap game, knows that this is not the way you bring it back. New listeners, who are unfamiliar of it's domination might like this album. I can't accept this at all.

Where are the Peel Sessions?+N+I don't understand why they didn't include the 6 extra John Peel Sessions that appeared on the original UK CD+music
A-W-E-S-O-M-E+P+I always love William Finn, and 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee is no exception. The show is full of funny character songs like "I'm Not That Smart" and "Woe is Me," but it also has real show pieces with "The I Love You Song" and "My Favorite Moment of the Bee." This show perfectly highlights Finn's ability to create quirky comedies with big hearts. It seems to always be in my CD player+music
What is this even called?+N+Seriously, is there ANYONE who can tell me just what the hell this album is supposed to be called? *Sigh*, these idiots don't even know how to spell properly. Anyway, this album, by far, is probably the worst of all the Lil' John attrocities, which is saying a lot since Lil' John really is a horrible artist+music
bee gees no. 1's+P+the album had all the great beegees song . they are just what i wante+music
Yngwie Malmsteen (amazing guitarist) hit the nail on the head+N+To quote him, (in the new issue of Revolver magazine), he said...  "I call it CRAP! It really disgusts me when it starts creeping into heavy metal. Mozart once said 'Music is melody; melody is music.' Talking into a microphone over a drum machine isn't musical! Rap has no melody, so it's not music. It is completely an utterly devoid of any talent. I'm repulsed the media glorifies it so much."  You're 1000000000000000000% correct man, keep up the good work. For good rap, listen to Ice-T  and Public Enemy. For good music in general, listen to Yngwie Malmsteen's solo work+music
Remastered?+N+And what for? I'd have expected some noise reduction in the songs of the first CD (for example, try The Partisan). The original recordings were noisy. This remastered version keeps all the noise, but now the sound is even poorer than in previous releases.  All in all, the selected songs are a good representation of Cohen's musical career+music
Some shoegazing going on here.+P+My wife and I saw this band at Slim's in San Francisco Saturday night and I must tell you, there was some definite shoegazing going on.  For those of you who don't know what shoegazing is, I'll explain it as simple as possible.  Picture the band standing on stage, staring down at their shoes (hence the term, "shoegazing") as they release a continuous hum of fuzz and distortion from their guitars.  When it's done right, as Film School does, it can be very powerful.  The floors, tables, chairs, and even my chest was vibrating to the sound.  Film School is much more than this, however.  In most songs, their shoegazing is limited to just portions of the song.  The songs are broken up by wonderful vocal melodies, baselines, and guitar picking.  You will hear what I mean when you listen to this album.  Highly recommended+music
pure non funk 2+N+funk is that kinda vibe you eat hotwings and groove at fish fries funk is when you come out of church's chicken jamming, sorry but half this cd is not funk, d train is bubblegum pop, gap band outstanding is not funky enough, but hits, why is queen on here they was not a funk group, the whispers no way hose, carl carlton's she's a bad mama jama is not a funk classic, i always said these funk compilations does the artists injustice, if you wanna learn what funk is check out the original recordings well i'll list a few, the entire catalog, and entourage of james brown, parliament-funkadelic, sly stone, larry graham, bootsy collins, barkays, ohio players, chaka khan and rufus, cameo,curtis mayfield, mandrill, earth, wind fire, war, the list is endless+music
Beware: Don't use in slot loading multi-disc CD players+N+There was a post from another reviewer about waiting for jams in slot-loading players...well, here you go. I would love to buy this CD, but I can't, because the new Fiona Apple DualDisc jammed my six-disc Rockford Fosgate in my 2005 Nissan when I put it in my player in the record store parking lot! And it took two months to have my CD player replaced. Anyone who buys this format must know you are taking a 50-50 chance in damaging your CD player. I had to buy Fiona again on iTunes and then burn a cd for my car. A real ripoff.  I hate giving Bruce one star, but this rating will get others to read this post and hopefully not ruin their Nissan car stereos+music
Nearly the ultimate edition of classic album+P+&quot;The Kinks are the Village Green Preservation Society&quot; appeared and disappeared with nary a trace when it was first released in 1968. Overshadowed by &quot;The White Album&quot; (The Beatles), Beggar's Banquet (The Stones)and other major releases, it seemed horribly out of step with its time when it was first released. That's because, as was often the case with The Kinks, it was. &quot;Village Green&quot; preceded the move back to the pastoral sounds and eagerness to recapture the innocence of the past by about twenty years. It sounds surprisingly fresh and vital now even if some the production occasionally sounds dated. That only adds to its charm.    Now expanded to fill three CDs (as it should have been when Castle/Essential remastered and re-released the album a couple of years ago), &quot;Village Green&quot; has never sounded so great and so complete. While it has a few glaring omissions (most notably &quot;She's Got Everything&quot; which Davies didn't really want on this album along with a couple of other tracks that were originally slated for but withdrawn from the finished line up), this is about as complete a representation as were going to get of the material recorded during the 1966-1968 time frame when &quot;Village Green&quot; was recorded. Lovingly restored and remastered under the supervision of Andrew Sandoval (how does Andy get all these great jobs?)with remastering done by the magical Bill Inglot and Dan Hirsch at Digiprep, &quot;Village Green&quot; sparkles and sounds the best it ever has on CD.    Disc one focuses on the original stereo version of the album. A better sounding version of this edition has never appeared before (although the Japanese K2 remaster sounded pretty darn close). We also get bonus tracks featuring a single A side from the time &quot;Days&quot; and the stereo alternate mixes that appeared on the withdrawn 12 track edition of &quot;Village Green&quot;. We &quot;Mr. Songbird&quot; (stereo version)as well.    Disc two features the mono version of the album. Since the mixes differ slightly, hardcore Kinks fans will want both versions. On the mono version we also get bonus tracks as well including the mono version of &quot;Mr. Songbird&quot;, &quot;Polly&quot;, &quot;Wonderboy&quot;, &quot;Berkeley Mews&quot; and a no strings version (the earliest from 1966)of &quot;Village Green&quot; to close out the CD.    Disc three is the one that will have fans salivating. The &quot;rarities&quot; disc as it's subtitled features a number of tracks previously unavailable (offically and unoffically) on CD plus tracks that have never been released. We get the following stereo &quot;rarities&quot;; &quot;Misty Water&quot; (and also the mono version which hasn't been released before), &quot;Berkeley Mews&quot;, &quot;Easy Come(previously unreleased on CD), There You Went&quot;, &quot;Polly&quot;, &quot;Animal Farm&quot; (alternate stereo mix previously unreleased), &quot;Johnny Thunder&quot; (an alternate stereo remix), &quot;Did you See His Name&quot;, &quot;Mick Avory's Underpants&quot;(an instrumental previously unreleased), &quot;Lavender Hill&quot;, &quot;Rosemary Rose&quot;, &quot;Wonderboy&quot;, &quot;Spotty Grotty Anna&quot;, &quot;Where Did My Spring Go?&quot;, &quot;Groovy Movies&quot;, &quot;Creeping Jean&quot;(and unreleased longer, stereo mix), &quot;King Kong&quot;. We also get the following mono tracks including &quot;Misty Water&quot;, &quot;Do You Remember Walter&quot; (a BBC session remix), &quot;Animal Farm(A BBC sesion remix), &quot;Days&quot;(A BBC session remix)and &quot;Phenomenal Cat&quot; (a mono instrumental mix).    A note on the &quot;rarities&quot;--many of these were previously available on &quot;The Great Lost Kinks Album&quot; and on bootlegs but never with sound this good. Also, the BBC sessions are, like many from the time, the instrumental backing with some new vocals dubbed on. They don't sound significantly different from the original versions but collectors will want them.     The deluxe packaging features a booklet with new comments from Ray, Dave, Pete and Mick on the making of the album and various tracks. We also get a discussion on the genesis and difficulties that the album faced. Sandoval also co-authors a brief synposis with info drawn from Doug Hinman's excellent book on The Kinks that discusses when the various recordings were made, differences between them and the process of putting together the album. &quot;Village Green&quot; is presented in a deluxe digipak accordian fold out sleeve. Sure, it's missing a few key album tracks but, really, this is as good as it gets when dealing with the corporate world and the compromises of reissuing classic albums.+music
Barbara Cook +P+I have pretty well all of her cd's and dvd's so this extra one from her concert at Carnegie Hall this year was especially welcome. Her voice is still terrific - some of the songs she sings bring tears to your eyes and others fill you with joy.   This is an album to treasure and hear again and again. Thank you Barbara!+music
hidden in plain view delivers a stellar debut!+P+the new album "life in dreaming" is a spectacular debut from hidden in plain view. definitely one of the best albumS of 2005 so far and will probably be in the top 10 of the year. the album is full of catchy hooks, tight riffs, double bass, and the singing is excellent. every song is full of emotion and you can really see some talent in this young band. i would say they sound like a mix between taking back sunday and senses fail. i admit that this album isn't anything new to the scene and they're very emoish but i think hipv will definitely make a dint in this already overcrowded scene. my only complaint is that the new version of "twenty below" isn't as good as it was on their ep, but it's still good. hipv don't really bring nething new to the table but their music is heartfelt and is a solid emo/punk record. definitely worth your money.+music
Ying Yang Twins - Me & My Brother+N+Yea I agree, these are the artists that give hiphop a bad name, if you could even call these guys artists. This album is strictly made for clubs, and for BET and MTV watchers and mainstream listeners. This is radio music, and stuff you would hear in the clubs. Thats all this music is good for. It has no creativity. The production on this album isnt bad, but lyrics, come on, you cant call these lyrics. I suggest you pass this album up unless your a mainstream listener. No top 5 for this album+music
Sorry..but they're no Pentangle+N+I've tried very hard with this album since its release, but have to disagree with most of the reviewers here. The incredible string band, pentangle, Bread, love and dreams comparisons are, in my opion, wishful thinking. This isn't due to Espers ability as song writers, but to their incessant use of annoying overdriven heavy metal type guitar everywhere. This ruins what is otherwise a nice album+music
Listen to Cohen himself!+N+It was irritating to hear the singers butcher Cohen's poetic songs.  Like other reviewers I wonder why Bono had to be there?  It was nice that the singers paid a tribute to the man but it's unfortunate that they took it one step further by singing his songs.  Some of the renditions are simply BAD ... like Bird on a wire!  Please ...+music
Don't see them live. It will ruin  it.+N+Dear Animal Collective,  I am mad at you for letting me drive two hours from home to be amongst your smelly patchouli stinking fans. I can't say I was happy when you guys to came out on stage and were completely ridiculous and well.....goofy. I never thought I would experience something that is the closest thing to a hippy rave, that I can think of. I was not impressed by all the crazy vocal effects you guys used. It sort of reminded me of that 16 year old kid messing around at guitar center. I noticed your almost dub/reggae influences...That upset me. I am even more upset by the white boy tribal thing you have going. I noticed that you guys don't sound anything like your albums. I noticed that the subtle things on the albums are exaggerated when played live to the point at where they are unenjoyable. I will have to listen to Sung Tongs again and see if holds up to your crazy live antics. Seriously, I get the feeling your producer saved you. I hope that I can still enjoy your stuff without horrible flashbacks from tonight+music
William Shatner, you are so cool+P+Brilliant, hilarious, and fun to listen. I think that "You'll Have Time" is one of my favorite songs of all time. Who ever would have guessed that about an album by ... William Shatner? He has a fine sense of self-parody, and the album is very well produced. William Shatner, you are so cool+music
Why Ask Why+P+Why do some people try to analyze what songs Neil decides to play. Just enjoy an excellent CD. For the ones who don't think Crazy Horse is a good band, listen to their first album. It would be a hit today on alternative country stations. Danny Whitten was a very good song writer, and his songs have been recorded by Three Dog Night, Rod Stewart, and The Indigo Girls to name a few. There is not a bad song on this CD. If you don't like C'mon Baby it's probably because you never had the man shine his light in your eyes. Keep these great releases coming+music
PLEASE!+N+i bought this CD because it had all my fave fred hammond songs on it. but little did i know that they are all, ALL bad versions of them! you can't even sing along! this CD sucks! DO NOT BUY THIS CD+music
Good one-disc compilation.+P+This John Lennon compilation is really good, except that I wish "I'm Losing You" had been included. Other than that, it does a good job of showcasing his hits and then some. The sound is great and I'd recommend this to anyone that just wants one, one-disc John Lennon compilation+music
where is the BEST song on this whole soundtrack?+N+I'm not buying this CD because I just found out it's Mortal Coil's track which is missing which completely ruins the whole CD.  That song is SO beautiful.  Why is it not on the CD? That's why I'm giving it one star although the other music used was highly effective+music
Stunning.+P+Simply stunning score. The theme is possibly the most moving track you will come across in years. You can not hear it through without your eyes watering and every inch of your skin turns to goose flesh. By far James Newton Howard's best score to date; although his score for Signs should be hard to top, he has done it+music
Gerald Albright Is On Fire Here!+P+This is Gerald's latest effort,and I must say,it is a real smooth jazz gem.Gerald really lets it fly here,with jazzy energy everywhere.There isn't a dud on the entire album!While you may have heard of the popular single from this album on the radio,the funky "To The Max",there is more to this album than just funk.While there are a number of funky,upbeat and groovy tunes on this album,such as "4 On The Floor","ToThe Max","Throw Yo' Hands In The Air",and"On The One",there are also an equal amount of more standard,traditional smooth jazz stylings as well.Not like its a bad thing,far from it,because these tunes help to balance the album out and more,keeping it from going stale.Some of the more standard tunes on the album are,"Why Georgia","Walker's Theme",and "Father's Lullaby",which Gerald produced in remembrance of his late father.However,even the not so funky tunes shine here,with one of the best examples being Gerald's nice cover version of "Why Georgia".There is also a vocal track on the album,"Condition Of My Heart",performed by a former "Boyz To Men" member.While the album as a whole is great,the best picks are,"4 On The Floor","To The Max","Why Georgia","Throw Yo' Hands In The Air","On The One",and "If You Don't Know Me By Now".If you are looking for an exceptional sax player,then look no further,because you just found one.This album should be in everyone's smooth jazz collection.I highly recommend it+music
Iceland strikes again!  What a unique and scary CD!! :)+P+Minus hails from Iceland, the land of rocky tundra and quirky rock groups (Sugarcubes, Bjork, Sigur Ros, Mum, etc.) none of which can hold a candle to meeting the intensity of Minus.  This is bar none the most unusual hardcore metal album I have ever heard and I'm LOVING it!  Yes it's screamy (well most of it), but it's very melodic with tons of tempo changes to keep you on your feet.  Mainstream metal this ain't and it isn't for the faint of heart.  If you're into Slipknot and need a bit more attitude (!!) or more complexity and layers, this might be up your alley!  Give it a try! [Fave tracks:  Pulse, Frat Rock and Misdo+music
BeBe &amp; CeCe's best+P+Nearly every song on the album is up to the same high standard set by the title track, &quot;Heaven.&quot; The tunes are memorable, the instrumentals enhance the vocals rather than being barely-noticeable fillers, and the  lyrics are a refreshing change from the hackneyed lyrics one often gets on  Christian radio stations. As one of the other reviewers has said, this drew  criticism from some, but anyone who listens carefully will see that the  Christianity is there. It's subtle rather than in-your-face, and thus  doesn't get tiresome. &quot;Heaven&quot; is an album that can and should be  listened to over and over+music
what happened?+N+I bought this cd when it first came out as a huge HRC fan. Vagrant records also has a quality track record judging from their band roster and their ability to somehow summon up the best of a band.  I thought HRC would benefit from much higher production quality as well as the influence of oustanding acts such the Alkaline Trio and Saves the Day surrounding them.. However, owning for the cd for nearly two years with many listens has made realize that the band used to create captiving, listenable hardcore is gone.  Nothing about this cd particularly interesting or grabbed me even on the first listen.  The disc loses its appeal early as nameless, medtempo pop crowds the speakers.  The vocals are more clear, however; the trade off is less compelling melodies and a lack of creativity.  Tracks like &quot;the Pharmacist&quot; identify a theme of short, competent, but boring songs.  I haven't heard anything more form HRC released this album and I don't think i would shell out 15 bucks again for something I would hear on the radio+music
dont waste your money+N+Wack cd. Low quality producer/s and talent.  except for about 2 or 3 artists (rakim & ken-y being the only reason i gave it 2 instead of 1 stars) this whole compilation is a complete waste of your time and money.  If you value your hard earned money then may i suggest "Los Kambumbos". it is a compilation of high quality produced by dj Jova and it includes a pantheon of quality artists including; trebol clan, khriz & angel, Nicky Jam, Tito el bambino and more.+music
This is The Album+P+80s , 90s and so far have observed a lack of true classic albums, i mean really true classic albums not that one microwaved bands glorified by the rolling stone magazine, MTV and the whole media, just think about it what albums come to your mind when you think or you discuss with your friends regarding classic albums? Beatles revolver? , any Bob Dillan work?, Presley sun sessions? Zeppelin? of course right? but try to think of any classic album after the 70s and you will have troubles i bet my ass, well, Smiths The Queen is Dead at least is one repply to this matter, because the sober and at the same melancholic mood along with the charming and calm voice of Stephen Patrick Morrisey, the Jhonny Marr deligthfull strings and beautifull lyrics made not only of "The Queen is Dead" but all Smiths albums gorgeous collectible pieces of British contemporary music, elegance and refinement are the basic elements of their music, "frankly Mr. Shankly" is one of my faves, "i know its over" , "the boy with the torn in its side" you name it!!!! this album can be easily included into 80s few classics. HM           +music
Asprin won't bring a dead hooker back to life ...+P+... so stop trying.  Dave Attell is dirty, dirty fun.  Attell is ten times dirtier than anything Andrew Dice Clay ever even considered, but he's at least one hundred times funnier+music
Not Very Good At All+N+I'm a HUGE Sinatra fan, but this is a weak brew.  Sinatra phones it in (literally - he wasn't even in the same room with his duet partners), and few of the guests offer anything of value.  This is a marketing ploy, not an album - get any of the great Capitol releases from the 50s and learn why Sinatra was the Entertainer of the Century..+music
Magnificent!!!  Bravo Horowitz!!+P+I remember hearing all about this concert in Moscow when I was a kid.  Whatever I thought - so some old guy played in Mosocw.  Well, reader you must forgive me for my stupidity, because for some time I realize the greatness of Maestro Horowitz, and the importance of his playing in Moscow, his hometown and homeland after 60 years.    I bought this album because I remember the hoopla in 1986.  I was not dissapointed.  The playing is emotional and incredible.  Horowitz really was an amazing piano player - the ability to hold rapture over the audience is captured here.  Those fingers -connected to a difficult, sole-eating, slight, Russian man - were magic. Wow.  Those beautiful notes he plays hold in the air like ripe fruit.  A master at work!   This was an inspired performance by a magician on the ivories.  If your wondering what the fuss was about, or you want a CD that expresses how classical music can move the soul - then I recommend this CD very highly.  Along with the Three Tenors IN Concert, it just has some inherent quality to move you.   Horowitz may have made better studio recordings, and better live recordings, but I am convinced this is just a good.  I join along with the gentleman who can be heard yelling "BRAVO" at the conclusion of several pieces.  BRAVO! +music
Just buy the good songs off of iTunes+N+first off, I'm into all the emo/screamo/alternative stuff. The Used, Senses Fail, Underoath, all of it. But this CD just doesn't cut it. It's not that it's bad, the songs just arent that interesting. Many of the songs just seem to have the same part it. The singer holding a note with the drummer riding on the double-bass pedal with mindless gutiar. of course tha's nto teh hole song. But each song seems to have that part in it. There a few good songs, like secrets don't make friends, and a few others. But it's not worth getting the whole CD. Just buy the good ones off of iTunes+music
Ew+N+I was listening to this and the person's voice is awful. He's not even like on tune. It's  very annoying+music
Waste of money!+N+This soundtrack is terrible, and I have loved most of Vangelis work for more than twenty years. The only good cut is "Titans" dont waste time on the rest. +music
The Duke Meets The Earl+N+I bought this album on pure speculation it was an Amazon recommondation and was uncharted waters for me. Owning around 200 blues albums with close to 100 of them being lps. I had never listened to either of these guys. Read the reviews and seemed like it would be a good venture. Received my cd figuring it would be like most blues albums and would take several listens before it would start throwing its arms around me. Wrong! This is one of the few albums I own that nails you right out of the box! It has been in my car stereo for around a month now and shows no indication of getting old.The first three tracks are non stop adrenalin guitar work with number three at just over 15 minutes just being a total piece of work. Smooth like a well aged whiskey. The final track with guest singer is one of the more haunting blues pieces I've ever heard. It's one of the few pieces I know that actually brings you to the edge of reverse blues and makes you feel bad this track is also in the 15 minute time slot too. All and all you can just let this cd run and it becomes nice back gound music to what ever it is you are doing. All in the way classical music does. I'd be surpised if any one really listening to this could give a bad rap! This is a real guitar players record+music
Williams does an Irish turn+P+Once again John Williams shows why he is so sought after as a soundtrack composer.  Anyone who has heard of this movie knows that it focuses on a young Irish couple seeking a new life in turn-of-the-century America, and Williams immerses himself so thoroughly in that reality that you almost feel as if you're listening to a CD by one of the many Celtic groups like Clannad or Gaelic Storm, only without the vocals.  From the triumphant to the contemplative to the pugnacious to the lively rhythm of the jig, every aspect of the Irish musical character is here.  (You may find that you have to turn up the volume: for some reason it isn't recorded at a particularly listenable level!)  There are also moments (as in &quot;Shannon is Shot&quot;) when Williams's own voice, so familiar to us from the &quot;Star Wars&quot; movies and his many other triumphs, makes a surprise appearance.  Once the characters have reached the West (&quot;Oklahoma Territory,&quot; &quot;The Land Race&quot;) he blends his recurring Irish themes with a musical motif that suggests the newness and astonishing size of the country and the many adjustments the young pioneers have to make.  I can't help wondering what Williams would be able to do with a &quot;real&quot; Western (why didn't Kevin Costner hire him for &quot;Open Range,&quot; for instance?).  An impressive example of a great composer's work+music
Cruel Intentions Theme+P+The theme played throughout the film is by Edward Shearmur, who also did numerous scores for motion pictures like "The Count Of Monte Cristo", "K-Pax" and "Sky Captain And The World Of Tomorrow"+music
I can't believe how bad this is+N+I used to listen the Dream Theater "back in the day" so I thought I'd check them out.  I can't believe how bad this CD is.  Am I glad I didn't pay full price for this.  What a boring, pretentious pice of crap+music
Isreal Symphomy Ochrester+N+Trash...trash...trash..the worst recording he has ever done..It would have been better if he recorded it with the Uganda Symphony Orchester. I wasted my money on this piecs of junk. And if possoble I'd like you to send this review directly to him+music
Hands-down classic hip-hop album+P+From the first few bars, this album grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go.   It's a little abstract, and might take a few listens to grow on you, but it's the perfect meld of classic hip-hop beats and robot-march production. After this album, El-P's tracks got a little distracting, to me at least, but "The Cold Vein" blends seamlessly.  The lyrical tag-team work of Vast Aire and Vordul is also something to marvel at. Dense, dense poetics, with metaphors and symbolism crammed into every verse; they often sound like they're cursing, even though they're not.  In the first cut, "Iron Galaxy," Vast paints a bleak picture of New York that sets the gritty tone for the rest of the album: "Let's talk in laymen's terms/rotten apples and big worms/early birds and poachers/New York is evil at its core/So those who have more than them/Prepare to be victims/Ate up by vultures/Politicians in a dog-eat-dog culture/That'll sic 'em."  Throughout the album, a dark, violent undercurrent runs through each song, from the syncopated "Vein" to the angelic stomp "A B-Boy's Alpha" to the brilliant closer, "Pigeon."  Of course, it's not for everybody. There is not one club-ready beat on the whole LP, and those who are going from the window to the wall will probably miss a lot of the clever one-liners and metaphors, but real heads recognize, and "The Cold Vein" is something a lot of MC's could learn from+music
Oh Me, Oh My!+P+Dylan goes country and he does it well. This is a record far too short. Good songs here, but not enough of them. It seems like you've just put the CD in the player and it's over. But other than the fact that there isn't as much music here as on a normal Dylan CD, I have no complaints. Dylan is in fine voice here, sort of a country, high pitched twang that works very nicely. He tells these songs of love and loss with such sincerity, such honesty. But then he attacks everything he does that way, so it should be no surprise. This is just a wonderful, if a bit too short, record+music
getting better and better+P+i was a little disappointed with the go-betweens comeback album, friends of rachel worth, it seemed to lack direction, the songs were too muddled (and in robert's contribution just plain dull and silly).  but on this record they have supassed themselves.  wonderful melodies, great lyrics, good, emotive delivery:  at the moment i'd put it up there as my favorite g-b's album, which is saying something after nearly 25 years in the business+music
Elevator Music+N+Don't recognize the names of any of these DJ's?    For good reason; their talent is non-existant+music
Mediocre rock group, manufactured album+N+I've listend to the cd several times, since I realize that some get better with listening.  I don't hate it.  But it is nowhere near being even "good".  Whoever wrote this band is as good as the White Stripes should burn in a musically igonorant hell+music
All due respect... but the flame's died down .+N+I got into AFI with the release of Art of Drowning, which is a fantastic album.  My girlfriend at the time had Black Sails in the Sunset and even though I didn't really get into it then, I now think it rivals AOD.  AFI has always been a band to look towards the future and embrace a sense of progress (this is highly commendable).  These two albums, which formed my introduction to AFI, now stand as the mid-part of their career.   The band has always refused to simply fall into the groove of what's cool.  They've always been unique.  Their first two albums came out of their intense interest in the 80's and early 90's hardcore punk scene.  Davey Havoc may have summarized the roots of the albums best when he says, "Ever since I can remember I wanted to be in a hardcore band," at the beginning of the "He Who Laughs Last" video.  These albums are full of the intensity of the early hardcore scene.  When the band emerged into this middle era the music was totally fresh and delightfully dark (it was there in the early days, though, in songs like Brownie Bottom Sundae).  These middle albums (haloween ep and self-titled included) also had an intensity and an energy that blew away their old sound.  Moreover, I've yet to hear a band in the world of punk (past and present) who's music rivals this intensity.  I appreciate the two newer albums on an artistic level; they continue to break the mold (the goth glam influence is pretty cool).  Besides, who can say they didn't see them foreshadowed in certain moments on Black Sails and AOD.  But, personally, it's pretty difficult to listen to Decemberunderground.  AFI deserves all the respect in the world but I don't feel much of the fire of the old days.    +music
Great collection, but they missed one+P+An excellent compilation of the darker side of classical music, although I would have preferred a different rendition of Toccata and Fugue in D (New York Philharmonic perhaps), it's still quite good.   But how could the series producer leave off Ravel's Pavane For a Dead Princess? It's preferable to Symphonie Fantastique - March to The Scaffold, plus Berlioz already makes an appearance with Dream of a Witches' Sabbath. If there was room, Verdi's Requiem would have been a nice addition too.   So I have to go with 4 stars only+music
From tragedy comes triumph+P+"Of Malice & The Magnum Heart" is basically a farewell to two friends of the band who died in a horrific car accident. Throughout this entire album, you can feel the hurt, pain, and anger of the days following the tragedy. A very good album, and one that needs to be listened to by anyone who has ever lost loved ones in their life+music
boringest band ever+N+I have seen these guys twice, once opening for six feet under, and the other for strapping young lad. And god almighty both times i wanted to bash my head in concrete to keep from hearing these guys. Overall these guys suck even the heavy parts and the melodic parts will put you to sleep. Stop trying to be unearth and opeth and make good music like they do..+music
A Beautiful Winter Garden+P+Having already recorded a full-length Christmas album, "To Drive The Cold Winter Away," Loreena McKennitt went into Peter Gabriel's Real World studios for three days with some musicians in July 1995 to record five Christmas songs just for fun. The end result is the Christmas EP, "A Winter Garden." Just 22 minutes long, "A Winter Garden" can easily be taken as a companion disc to "To Drive The Cold Winter Away." Loreena & company perform this quintet of holiday songs beautifully, especially the gorgeous, nearly-7 minute rendering of "God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen," easily one of the very best versions of this classic song ever recorded. There are also spirited performances of "Coventry Carol," "Good King Wenceslas," "Snow" (originally featured on "To Drive The Cold Winter Away"), and "Seeds Of Love." "A Winter Garden" is a lovely holiday postcard from Loreena McKennitt.    +music
Pete Townshend's Turntable+P+Ok, this LP must have been on Pete Townshend's turntable day and night. Listen to the first track and you'll hear where "Baba O'Riley" and "Won't Get Fooled Again" came from. In fact, the Riley in "Baba O'Riley" IS Terry Riley.   - Vincent G. Marin+music
Good Collection of songs+P+Eddie Cochran rocks,  This is a must have for any Rockabilly fan or any fan of Rock n Roll........The real stuff.  It's too bad he had to die at such a young age, it would've been nice if he could've been around to make more great music,  with songs like "Jeanie Jeanie Jeanie", "Somethin' Else", "Come on everybody", "Guybo", "Summertime Blues", "Twenty Flight Rock", and my personal favorite "Bolweevle" (don't know if thats spelled right, but its a really cool song).   This is an Enjoyable album from start to finish, this is the way rock n roll is supposed to sound+music
WOWWOWWOWWOW+P+This is the first cd that I have bought this year and been completely blown away. Everything on this album is awesome. I haven't taken it out of my cd player since I picked it up on Tuesday. These guys are primed to blow up! I can't wait to see them play live it's going to be great. Anyways the whole cd is great. I love the crunchy guitars and heavy drumming. I can't believe how amazing this band is. Congrats are in order to Metal Blade for getting these guys. The band reminds me of an early Killswitch Engage right before their second album took off. I really expect similar things from WS. To think that this album is as good as it is is surprising. I remember hearing these guys on a compliation and not thinking all that highly of them, but after getting a sample mp3 on Metal Blade's website I decided I had to get this cd and I haven't been disappointed. This album should be on everyone's radar in the next couple of months, just watch. It took KSE's second album a little while to catch on but once it did, boom, it blew up. Just rest assured knowing that you had this album way before anyone else if you're smart enough to pick this up ASAP.+music
Made in China not her best, but still undeniably Juliana+P+While this album doesn't reach the maturity and beauty of records such as Beautiful Creature nor does it flaunt the naivety of masterpieces such as Hey Babe nor does it reach the pop mastery of her recent Some Girls effort, it delicately floats among the three creating a brief, unwavering expression of true music. Made from base emotions and raw vocals and instruments, this is quite a unique Juliana record indeed.  Has Juliana become a bit too jaded for her own good? Maybe, but who cares, there are some truly catchy songs on here, such as Stay Awake. All these angry, grungy, alternative mainstream chick rockers you are hearing now on top 20 countdowns across the world, were invariably influenced by this wonderful songwriter. For anyone else, I might dismiss her often childish lyrics and emotions, but she has proven that she is real the deal, endearing us with her honest feelings more than pushing us away.  But these aren't the reasons I'm telling you to listen to this album, it's because she is still the Juliana we know and love, just a little older and perhaps a little more bitter. She is still the one making us hum her songs at work, on the bus, whereever we may be. She is ornery pop music taken directly and unedited from the heart. I would have loved a few more "quiet" songs, but I'm sure she'll take care of that on her next album -- think Juliana's Pony but way better, all the songs have a harder edge than her last few albums.  With each new listen, Made in China becomes that much better, revealing a definite evolution of her one-of-a-kind sound. If this is your first time with her, then go back and listen to the beginning (Blake Babies on up) and you can experience an artist that is rewarding and refreshing to listen to+music
Separation Sunday this is not.....+N+I enjoyed Separation Sunday tremendously, an original (although not for everyone) album full of hard rocking music and raucous lyrics to match.  As a thitrysomething, I found the lyrics on Sep. Sun. to be a clever look at the party scene and the passage of time, with both the highs and lows of growing out of the mayhem and into adulthood, or reaching your own "resurrection".  This new album (Boys and Girls) is much more drab, with less of an in-your-face delivery of fairly lame lines that I would be emarrased to listen to if I were older than 20.  These are juvenile songs which sound aimed at the MTV generation, with cheesy lines and hooks.  I had thought this band was the real deal, and had argued as such, but after hearing this it is clear they are a bunch of posers.+music
I Like It+P+My parents loved John so I am familiar to a degree with his music and the special sound of his voice. I think this CD sounds good and I like the selection of songs. What else can one say? You like it or you don't for one reason or another. I like it and listen to it and that's just me. Enjoy what we are given and what remains+music
pet rocks are neat+P+i dunno why this album's so cheap, but i figure they just wanted more people to hear the good music on it.  lots of bang for your buck, these are some great songs if you like college rock kind of stuff.  i guess it kind of reminds me of the strokes.  doesn't really sound like that though+music
Travesty+N+The Kidz Bop series is the ultimate travesty in music. And don't think that it's good just because your kids might love it. Kids also like to eat McDonalds, but don't try telling me that their food is healthy. There is plenty of good music out there than is clean enough for children. And, surprisingly, a lot of these songs are very inappropriate for children, even with the expletives deleted. There is no reason on earth why these records should exist, excepting for the fact that record execs want to milk more money out of the singles once their radio play starts to diminish. I agree with the person who suggested the Beatles as an alternative. Seriously, don't buy this!+music
Juelz should be missing his tongue+N+Yes the game has been missing the constant songs about drugs, girls, cars and jewelery. I tell you Juelz really came with an original formula with this album. The stuff he mentions on this one has never been said before and Juelz is an innovator as well as the rest of the dipset. LOL!!!! These guys listen to other peoples albums and just reiterate the same stuff in a different song and beat. Save your money+music
What happend to the BTNH we used to know? +N+I love Bone, but you gotta admit this album is terrible. Bad beats, bad rhymes the whole nine yards. It seems like Bone went from Thug to Corny and thats coming from a true Bone fan. A truly wack CD put out by one of the best rap groups of all time.+music
Possibly The Best Experimental Jazz Record Ever Made.....+P+There really isn't much you can say but totally unpredictable and absolutely ingenius from start to finish. One of those rare records that keeps you on the edge of your seat and you find yourself saying about every other minute "How the hell did he think of that?". The ideas are bountiful and over the top brilliant. Every record collection should have at least one copy of Can Tago Mago, Captain Beefheart Trout Mask Replica and Naked City by John Zorn. Amazing stuff+music
Smooth Jazz with a Bounce+P+I had never heard of Tom Braxton before this CD and boy was I pleasantly surprised.  This is definitely a nice album to listen to+music
Shut Up and Play!+N+Eric Johnson is as talented a guitar player as God ever put on this earth. His chords and notes are so clean, it defies belief. You wonder out loud how someone could master an instrument as well as he does. Growing up in Austin, I have had the chance to see him numerous times, and my opinion of him has not changed in 20 years, he can't sing! I am sorry, but Eric has always had this desire to be a pop star. So many people in Austin just cringe at concerts when he stops rocking, so that he can sing one of his sappy lyrics. It is a waste. Now don't jump on me! I love the guy! But I wish he would stick to playing guitar and quit the singing. The guy just has so much talent+music
One Great Song among many bad ones.+N+I bought this CD thinking I love the song Schism so even if the rest of the CD is just OK it will be worth the money. I was wrong. The CD is just boring. With the exception of Schism the entire CD is forgettable. This was the first Tool CD I have ever bought and it's also the last+music
please note all the five-star reviews by kids+N+Remember the style of music that came out in the late 70's called Punk?  The pioneers of this type of music were bands such a Clash, The Sex Pistols, The Ramones and the Talking Heads.  The style becamse somewhat funk-influenced to the gut-wrentching hardcore metal influenced sounds of The Dead Kennedies and Ministry.  Even Social Distortion had their own little sound to offer.  This is how it went through the 80's.  Yet, after the who Nirvana-mania that saved music from Whitesnake and Warrent, Punk, as well as many other sounds, seemed lost until...  Green Day comes around with "Dookie."  This continued the punk sound into what we know today.  So in the words of Oasis:  "Where did it all go wrong."  It's not that this sounds on it's own is bad.  When Blink 182 first came out, they had a lot of fun to offer.  But gawd, where do we draw the line?  After that, we had ( in no particular order) Sum 41, New Found Glory, My Chemical Romance, Showoff, and jeez, I could go on forever.  They all sound so much alike.  Still they were once tolerable.  But with simple plan, (sigh), enough is enough.  I can't even tell the difference sometimes between these guys and Bowling For Soup.  And I don't easily confuse bands.  Really, though, these guy call themselves Punk.  But last time I checked, Punk was about rebellion, Anarchy, disatisfaction with where humanity is going, all that stuff.  Ex Sex Pistols "Anarchy In The UK" or Ramones "I'm Against It."  Now Listen to some of the titles off this:  "I'm Just A Kid," "God Must Hate Me," "I'd Do Anything."  Difference?  You'd have to be blind not to see one.  These guys have jumped on the "poser" bandwagon that every other "punk" band on a major label has jumped on, and thus, mainstream punk is doing the same thing heavy Metal is+music
An awesome CD+P+This is one of the best albums I have ever heard. There's no songs on here that I don't like. All of them are great. Especially I'm Just a Kid, I'd Do Anything, and Perfect. I reccomend this to anyone who likes bands such as Yellowcard, The All-American Rejects, and blink-182 or anyone who is looking for some good music to listen too+music
Awful Compilation CD - No Original Artists +N+Drew's Famous Party Music is a joke. I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased this cd. In the past 3 weeks, I have probably ordered 8 or 9 compilation cd's looking for great music from the 70s, 80s and 90's for a party I am hosting. I read the reviews for the other cd's and they were great, but in my excitement about finding Whoomp there it is and Love Train, I didn't check the reviews for this cd. This CD is not at all what I thought it would be. Trust me, THIS IS NOT THE ONE, it's not even on the list. I was looking for Whoomp there it is, and especially Love Train by the Ojays. Not what I got. I excitedly listened to Whoomp, and I kept saying this doesn't sound right. Something sounds like its missing from the song. So I listened to Love Train, and immediately, I knew that it was not the Ojays singing. I realized that none of the original artists were singing. This is a terrible misrepresentation. I was so disappointed! Thank goodness I listened to the cd before I played it at the party. I would have been horrified. I wish I could give it less than one star and get a refund. Please, please, please DON'T waste your money+music
2-1/2 stars -- MY 700th REVIEW! WHEE!!!+N+After the success of Kamikaze, many diehard Twista fans accused him of having sold out, because it wasn't until he hit the mainstream that he started seeing platinum sales. Love it or hate it, Twista tried to continue that essence with his follow-up, The Day After. Unfortunately, it just doesn't work as well.  Most of the other two-star reviews are pretty accurate (especially Constant and Norris' respective reviews). I think it can be assumed that the day after is Women's Day because Twista is spending most of the album rapping to the ladies (LL Cool J, anyone?). Not only that, but in some places it's a little too obvious that he's trying to recapture the magic of "Slow Jamz". The lead single "Girl Tonite" is the most obvious example of this, especially since Twist is once again naming balladeers and their respective songs. Also, am I the only one to find it a little odd that Twista says "When I touch her, she like" and then TREY says "Oh"? (Think about it a minute.) Another example is an obligatory Neptunes track called "Lavish", where Twista proves that he can't always rap over a slow beat.  Yet another song for the ladies that fails is "So Lonely" featuring Mariah Carey. I don't know what's up with Mimi's voice on the song, but she kind of sounds like a wannabe version of herself. Speaking of weird hooks, "Had to Call" features a chorus sung by somebody named Sleepy Eyed Jones, and he sounds like, well, it's kind of like the equivalent to how DJ Premier would sound if he tried to sing.  There are also some songs that badly use samples, especially the aptly titled "Do Wrong" (with Lil' Kim), which borrows a sample from Al Green's "Love & Happiness". And "I'm a Winner" terribly samples R. Kelly's "One Me", and if that's not bad enough, Twista is even repeating some of the lines he used in "Girl Tonite". But things aren't much better when he's NOT kickin' it to the females: the title track doesn't go anywhere, and Syleena Johnson's hook adds nothing to the song. "Heartbeat" is a little too violent (especially because the song opens with a long round of shots), and "Check That H*" has a wack chorus. And "Holding Down the Game" is a bling-blingin' song that is unnecessarily screwed and chopped in the middle of it -- and anyway, if you wanted to hear someone rapping slowly, you wouldn't pick up a Twista album, would you?  The only song really worth hearing on the whole album is "Get It How You Live". It's nice that Twista is still trying to do his thing, but I heard this album one day last week and then I had no desire to listen to it again the day after.  Anthony Ruper+music
Should have changed name, simple as that.+N+This band claiming to be hopesfall is not! There is only one original member left, they should of changed their name with the release of atypes, no question. Atypes is a disgrace to the people who grew up with hopesfall in NC! I would have respected them if they changed their band name+music
Innovative in theory, but doesn't come together+N+I must say before I write this review, I tried. I tried really hard to get into this album.  I am a huge Pink Floyd fan, a fan of all Classic Rock for that matter. I got this CD for it's historical significance. It is, after all, the first Rock Opera.  Anything you hear about this album being similar to The Wall by Pink Floyd is false. True, it is a rock opera that tells the story of a troubled individual, but it doesn't get as advanced or deep as Pink Floyd does. There are a few key problems that get in the way of this goal.  The music. Original as it may be, The Who's strange melodies and instrumentation don't do anything for me. The melodies are for the most part, predictable. When they try to go out on a limb, it fails and sounds forced. The guitar parts and solos sound thin, and although a big part of it is probably because the master tapes were ceremoniously burned and the recording isn't prime quality, I'm sure a lot of it has to do with a mediocre recording job. It has it's moments, for example, the first few secconds of "Smash the Mirror". But on the whole, it sounds almost like amateurs.  The songs. Not trying to rag on any diehard townshend fans, but the songs seem to be forced into the Opera mold. While this may make it more of a true "rock opera" than "The Wall", for example, it doesn't make for a very easy listen.  The horrible thing is that it IS possible to write songs in opera form and have them flow. Exhibit A: Queen's "A Night at the Opera". Although Queen's superb tracking skills probably helped their case a lot. Which leads me into my next point.  Lack of depth. While musicians who don't layer their songs with extra tracks and studio musicians generally appeal to me, they shouldn't try to make arena rock operas. The Who's attempts to make this work is very similar to asking the white stripes to make a rock opera. It can't be done effectively within the limits of the band.   I did give this album two stars. One for an original concept that gave us so much in the long run, and another star for those few moments it has. Smash the Mirror (the introduction), Pinball Wizard and The Acid Queen are alright. There is a reason why those tracks are popular.  I'm afraid that a lot of people aren't really analyzing this album and are just giving it five star ratings because it is "The Who", the band with the man who smashed his guitar onstage.   If you are looking for a Rock Opera, I suggest "A Night at the Opera" or "The Wall". If you are looking for another "The Who" album, I would suggest some of their later works. "The Who Sells Out" was alright, certiantly better than this.+music
Why, India, Why????+N+I'm a massive, huge, big-time India fan. I have every release and have witnessed her powerful live performances from NYC to Miami, but I must say that I'm not feeling this cd.  It sounds a bit rushed and her vocals seem to be recorded diffrently than usual, not as strong.  I love the title track as well as "Cuando Hieres A Una Mujer" and "No Es Lo Mismo".  That's 3 good ones out of 11 songs.  This from an artist that has released cd's that you can listen to from beginning to end.  I don't even know what to say about "Madre E Hija aka MADRE", although I think the sentiment is sweet, it's comes across corny.   Now that we've lost Celia, I was hoping that she would raise the bar a bit and drop an unique, beautilfully produced cd.  I figured she would snatch Salsa back from Reggaeton and create a classic in the vein of Ms. Cruz.  I'm a bit dissapointed that she's still singing about lost love and scorned lovers.  I thought after her great Sony release "Mi Alma y Mi Corazon" we'd get amazing material......and what happened with Sony anyway??? Now she's with Univision?!?!  India-I still admire you and I'll always support your work.....spoken like a true fan.    +music
Que buena musica!+P+Esta cd es muey bueno. Pero, y piensa la mismo de los oltra personas. Los unas muy suave, son mala. Son bueno concions, pero son malas por esta cd de buena musica por bailar.  Los oltra mas cds son perfectates por un fiesta or por manajas largos.  This cd is great with the exception of the softer songs.  I prefer those with the upbeat attitude like the one by Albita.  I like her style.  I highly recomend that you buy it+music
Purchased for the Husband+P+I purchased this set for my husband after hearing him talk about it for quite some time.  He is thrilled with it and plays it quite often.  It is apparently a 'Must Have' for any Springsteen fan+music
the new rubbish+N+its a good thing i downloaded this for free. because aint no way in hell i'd buy it+music
Get This Album!  It's Fantastic!+P+I can't get enough of this music. The lyrics are great, the music hints of a cross between the best of the Police and the best of Peter Gabriel.  If you ever loved these bands you'll love this. It's the most compelling music of its kind I've heard in a long time. Listen to &quot;I Fall To Pieces&quot; and you'll agree+music
I'm a tad disappointed...+N+Let me start off by saying, I am a HUGE Beyonce fan, and I am not in any way "hating" on her.I love her voice, her stage presence, her look; I mean, the girl is BAD(in a good way)! Now, with that said, I really expected more from her. Like I've read in so many people's reviews, I heard 'Deja Vu' and I just KNEW this album was gonna be off the hook. However, that was not the case. I really like the strength and fierceness of B-Day (I'm all for female empowerment), but the songs seem really...sloppy in a way.Beyonce is a creative and talented songwriter,but on B-day its like she was writing for Keshia Cole (a simpler, more 'urban' style). Not saying that she doesn't appeal to the urban crowd, its just that Beyonce is a little more sophisticated than what she's showing us in B-Day. Dangerously in Love was a better album. She had dance songs, love songs, feel-good songs; it took you to so many places that few artists can go on an album. B-day did not do that for me. Beyonce has the potential to produce a great album; I'm looking forward to her next project. Sorry B, I still love you though+music
Fun! Fun! Fun!+P+While I wish the disc clocked in longer than 35 minutes, it is crammed with fun songs that get you moving. The Come Ons do not have typical sound and I think anyone would enjoy this effort! Be sure to check out track 11 - I'll Show You Why - my personal fave+music
They were too lazy to score new music....+N+So the creators of this show paid a lot of money to various record companies to feature songs on the TV show soundtrack and hardly if ever used new music that they themselves would compose or not.   It is really product placement of the worst kind.  Be lazy and let other recording artists do the work for you, considering that this stupid show was made the way it was, it was not surpiseing that they reverted to this just to save money+music
Damn good.  Better than her others+P+I always liked Nelly Furtado for her originality but this new CD is very different than just about anything else out there.  It's difficult to define a genre for it as it's very diverse.  I wasn't sure if I would like it as I found her other CDs good but a little weird but on the contrary, I enjoyed the entire album.  This is really a great album+music
BOrRRRRrrrrInG+N+This CD is so boring. Sarah McLachlan has written / performed songs before that have set people alight with her passion, her intensity, her hurt, etc... these are very TIRED renditions of all-too-familiar Christmas songs. Sure, I can stomach a Kenny Rogers Christmas, for some reason it just seems to make sense. But Sarah McLachlan putting out a Christmas album seems to be nothing more than a combination of not having new material of her own and needing some more bucks. Excuse my frankness, but this album is very disappointing+music
Romance is still alive in Shall We Dance CD and DVD+P+I watch this movie over and over.  The story is wonderful, the acting is great--who can resist Richard Gere's tiny smile towards his wife, Susan Sarandon.  And this was my first intro to Jennifer Lopez who was excellent and a wonderful dancer.   The music?? Well, I had to have the music; it is varied and it is romantic and uplifting and introduced me to Peter Gabriel and other music.  You won't be sorry to buy this music--it makes you want to get up and dance slow and fast!!  And if you are a little bit of an oldster, like me, it will bring back youthful and memorable feelings of romance and real love+music
I Am DSGB!+N+Troy why did you put your name on this.  This cd has one good song on it and that is about the long and short of it.  I am not going to waste a bunch of time talking about a cd that is not worthy of being pressed, by the way the group was better with Conrad the Colonel (Ehhhh Hehhh!  I AM DSGB!+music
Very Disappointing Soft Psychedelia+N+If you like warmed-over Syd Barrett, here's your guy. A few nice tunes but becomes monotonous very quickly. Stoltz can't sing worth a damn - I'd like this a lot more if his vocals were wiped and a real singer overdubbed+music
Outkast Does It Again - Another Classic+P+Another 5-Star Classic from the hottest duo in the game. Standout tracks: So Fresh, So Clean - Ms. Jackson - Spaghetti Junction -  but the single B.O.B. steals the show - so fresh and clean itself you might put it on loop for a few days before you listen to the rest of the album. This CD a definite must for any music collection regardless of your musical taste.+music
Superman Returns Soundtrack+N+I didn't care for the sountrack nearly as much as I thought I would. It lacked the excitement of the movie+music
Perfect In Every Way+P+Eazy-E is my favorite rapper and i find him highly underrated. He was easily the best member in NWA and the hype surrounding his death should have been much bigger. He is a one-of-a kind rap genius with a sound unlike anybody else. This album is a masterpiece and is perfect in every way. The opening song Still Talkin' is hilarious and Eazy drops freestyles that sound like he isnt even trying. To hear some of his best verses of all time check out No More ?s which is my absolute favorite song done by him ever. The album flows together beautifully and even the bonus songs at the end are funny including Merry Muthaf***in' Xmas which is classic. Other classics include Ruthless Villian, 2 Hard Mutha's, Boyz-N-The Hood Remix, Eazy-Duz-It and We Want Eazy. There is no doubt in my mind that he should be a legend along with Pac and Biggie... he just left WAY before he could establish himself as big as them. also the feud with Dre and Death Row hurt his reputation greatly right before he died. Nonetheless he is amazing and Dre & MC Ren also add to this great cd. Do not hold out.. buy this ASAP+music
Awesome!+P+What I love about this cd is that it has a song for just about every mood you could have. Vocals are astounding.+music
hearkening back in time+P+What a beautiful record.  The sound is so like Nick Drake and Tim and Jeff Buckley.  In this age of candy coated rock and Jessica Simpson, it is such a relief to hear someone playing real, soulful music.  Heart searching lyrics and beautiful melodies pared with Murdoch's subtle voice make for a haunting and beautiful album+music
Sacred Love - not sacred and I don't love it+N+This CD fell far far below my high expectations of Sting.  I found it unimaginative, sounding much like many of his earlier pieces+music
This sucks so badly...+N+Everyone who reviewed this piece o' crap 1 star had the right idea. Now, let me drive the point home further: this song is pathetic. Billy Joe should really quit whining about how he "walks alone". After all, Green Day is on top of the music world right now in spite of being a lame Nirvana retread. So sorry, but you don't walk alone. Maybe if he had the decency to admit he was only in it for the money, I wouldn't be so opposed to this song.  I've heard it said that this song has emotion. That's great...where? I know it's not in the bored way Billy Joe sings his uninspired, typical "Nobody-loves-me-even-though-I'm-also-a-rock-star-and-I-have-fans-on-the-other-end-of-the-world-but-becuase-I'm-a-sellout-I'll-sing-about-being-a-loser" lyrics. You want emotion? Listen to Bell Bottom Blues by Derek & the Dominoes. You can tell that Eric Clapton meant every word he said. With this annoying track, all you can tell is that Green Day is a highly overrated group. If they don't stop playing this song, and fast, I don't know what I'll  do.+music
This is a rather stupid album+N+However, with all the good material in the early 90's coming out I was suckered into listening to just about every little thing. This has some rather blah songs on it, and the thing is they try to sound like everyone, but themselves. On "Dead & Bloated" they try to sound like Danzig, "Sex Type Thing" which is the best song on the whole album they sound like Alice In Chains, "Wicked Garden" and "Plush" they sound like Pearl Jam, and probably the only song that they do sound like themselves is "Creep", and with this one I have some rather bad memories of this as I remember this is one of the songs I heard all the time when I first moved down to Florida. I moved down with no job, or no car, and I was bored out of my skull, and no social life either, as no one seemed to speak to one another. As the lyrics go "Feeling Uninspired...Think I'll Start A Fire". Now that I was down in Florida full time I wasn't having a good time, and I know even now listening to this song makes me remember those hard first few months down here as if they were yesterday, and it's because at times I feel it was. Everything else on this album was too perverted, or just too long-winded.+music
Buffalo farts are probably more musical than this crap!!!+N+I can not belive how a band as lame as this can actually get signed to a label. They make Limp Bizkit look like Led Zeppelin and I hate Limp Bizkit! I made the mistake of seeing them on Craig Kilborn the other night and believe it or not, they're even worse live than in the studio. Whne I hear something like this being actually called music, I almost want to ram ice picks into my eardrums so I won't have to hear it. If car company put out cars with the same quality standards as some of today's band's so-called music, we'd all be walking or dead. This sounds like someone yelling and screaming while pushing a lawnmower. As another reviewer said, If I could give this negative stars, I would. Avoid this at all cost!!+music
Very Poor+N+Poor singers, annoying sound effects in what some people call songs. Their voices are just auful at times, like a sqeaky old granma. God I hate this album+music
I threw this cd away+N+I did not like this cd at all.  There was not even one song that I liked.  However, given the positive result the cd received, it may just have been my personal taste.  I also got her new cds, and did not like those eithe+music
Yet another mis-titled "Very Best Of" album+N+Yet another attempt to re-write history and ignore the pre-Rumours era of the band. To truly be called The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac, you would have to include at least, Black Magic Woman, Oh Well, Sentimental Lady and Hypnotized. There are many more quintessential songs from the pre-Buckingham/Nicks era that should be included, but those four were in heavy FM rotation in the early 70's. They exposed the band to a huge audience, which made their commercial breakthrough in 1975 possible. To exclude them and then title this release a "best of" is criminal+music
The Vintner's Reserve+P+Blues fron the heart of Montana. The music on this album is the vintner's reserve. Phil making music for Phil,and then sharing it with the rest of us at just the right time.  This album is all Phil, all piano, and very, very good.  Phil say's in the liner notes, "The Blues is simple soul music with room to get your name up". Simple for him, but this vintner's reserve is delightfully complex in flavors for the listener and subtle in style and performance from tune to tune. Soul music it is, from the heart to nourish the soul. Does he get his name up? You bet!  I think this is Phil's best album yet. But then again, who can make that claim when thinking of "Cinema" or "Upright" or "A Wild Christmas" or "Live! From Montana" or "High Plains" or - all of his other timeless tunes produced over the years and on record labels past and present?  If you haven't heard Philip Aaberg's music; from his hideout (Sweetgrass Music Label) near the Sweetgrass Hills in north central Montana, or if you haven't listened to him lately, then it's time to take "That Train" and "Fourteen Dollars" and head west, Blue West!+music
Pure pop rock+P+I bought this the same day I bought Nevermind by Nirvana, and to this day this album ranks higher on my list of favorites.  Maybe it's because I was just a kid when I first heard this, but it sounds so vibrant and original.    Yeah, the band utilized two bassists to form their sound, which sounds gimmicky until you hear it.  Basically, they had a guitarist and bassist playing the rhythm/backing parts and one bassist playing the crisp/trebly lead, which gave their sound this bright and aggressive feel.  And John Penney's voice is perfect for the music; it's a little angry, a little strange, and a little hopeful.    This band won't be remembered as an "important" band (like Nirvana, Pearl Jam or other bands coming up at the time), but I don't think they would particularly care to be.  This is music made for the moment, and sounds pretty pure because of that+music
fabuloushardcore+P+My brother saw Hopesfall perform one of their first shows back in 1999.  He told me about how amazing they were, so I tracked down Frailty of Words and bought it online.  I had all but stopped listening to hardcore before the first night I listened to the DTS release.  Just like a lot of independent music, my first listen was a confused and almost disappointing one.  But then I listened to it again.  Now, nearly five years later, this is still my favorite cd of all time.  I listen to all kinds of music too.  I'm not a die hard metalcore/hardcore fan by any stretch of the imagination.  These guys are blessed.  Even though the original members have all gone their seperate ways for the most part, I still support and buy every album that this band comes out with.  Now, let me get to No Wings To Speak Of.  Just as enjoyable as their first album, and slightly more progressive.  If you want to here some outstanding music, buy this EP.  Trust me, for fans of hardcore, this is cutting edge pure emotion spilled out over sound waves.  It will change your perception forever.  Everyone rants about End Of An Era.  It's absolutely 100% as good as people say, but every song on here is equally impressive.  This is the fullest sounding, most emotionally driven, heart pounding, deep and intense music I've heard maybe ever.  If you don't buy this cd, you are cheating yourself big time.  If you like Hopesfall, I strongly recommend 7Angels 7Plagues, Misery Signals, Evergreen Terrace, Between The Buried and Me, Prayer For Cleansing.  All these bands deliver much passionate hardcore, but you just can't compare them to Hopesfall.  They are in a Leauge all their own.  And just one more thing.  What is it about North Carolina that so many of these awesome bands come from there?  I dunno+music
No product yet!+N+Unfortunatelly, until now I did not received my cd! I guess what happened? Thanks, Octavi+music
More Than Just Filler!+P+When i bought this cd i was expecting learn to fly to be the best song and the rest to be just filler to make a full album. was i ever wrong. this is now one of my favorite cds and the best foo fighters cd to date, it is full of catchy riffs and songs that are sure to please everyone+music
Unhelpful, unsingable+N+My church has been using this CD, and many people have been raving about it, but I feel that the reviews are unjustified. To me the CD promotes an experiential feeling of worship, where it is the music and the experience of the CD that is creating a 'feeling' of God's presence - many of the previous reviews appear to be alluding to such a thing. Because the songs are conference songs the songs stick to Adoration-type songs only (ie. songs expressing the greatness of God) - and there aren't really any songs which give their *focus* to expressing what God has done for us, or songs of confession, or songs of supplication, or songs by which we can encourage one another. The theology is very one-sided and I think for this reason very unhelpful - compare, say, to having a service where all you prayed for was to praise God for how great he is - while it's a very important thing, it's not the only thing - you are missing out on something and that's what I think this CD does.  The other problem I have is that the arrangements are just too high - sure, the singers on there can sing them, but anyone with an average voice range (especially males) will have some trouble hitting some of the notes in this. "Indescribable" hits a top F - not great for congregational singing.  There are some much better CDs out there with good Christian songs - I'd skip this one and try something else+music
Fantastic+P+This CD is the best Caribbean music that money can buy in CD form. The tracts are well organized. Perfect CD for a dance party+music
bad recording+N+I received the first recording and in the final movement there was a bad skipping. I notified Amazon and they sent me another recording which had the same problem. I received a credit and Amazon said the recording was evidently a bad one and they would check it out. Thanks Billy Lede+music
No New Tricks+N+I am a huge a Jurassic 5 fan, in fact they are probably the single biggest influence of why I started to like hip hop.  On this album nothing catches your attention.  The use the same formula that they have used in the past, but the execution of the songs sometimes seems forced.  A lot of that has to do with Cut Chemist not being there.  Nu-Mark is a good producer, but when he steps aside to let others produce the music you can tell the difference.  "Back 4 you" and "Red Hot" are really the only two good songs on the album. There are a couple of other decent tracks but nothing that is going to get stuck in your head.  Also the song with Dave Matthews Band is AWFUL, but J5 wanted to try something new, and I think that is an interesting artistic decision, it just does not work very well between these two styles.  This is by far the worst J5 album, if you want classic J5 pick up Quality Control, or their EP, each of these are defining hip hop+music
best album ever of all time+P+"A mind shattering f*cking explosion of stimulation straight to the brain." +music
I know that it sounds like hyperbole, but.....+P+Pure Genius!!! Loveless is an absolutely essential album, and so much better than anything as of late - at least, better that anything I've heard. Imagine the most melodic guitar noise combined with exquisite vocals and intelligent lyrics, and you'll get a sense of what Loveless is all about. This is music of passion and of strange beauty - it's like trying to describe a purple rose to a blind man. If you're at all enamored by ambient music with a pronounced romantic stripe, you will LOVE this! So what are you waiting for?  +music
Cool doesn't necessarily mean tepid+P+For those of you who (unfairly) criticize this latest effort by the vastly underappreciated Teenage Fanclub as being lackluster, I wish to offer a different interpretation. Yes it is a subdued and carefully-produced effort, in keeping with their later work rather than the Bandwagonesque-era looseness and feedback-drenched Big Star rock.   But it is not without soul or passion.  It is simply a more relaxed record, more sculpted, more careful.  The music still flows nicely, the lyrics are stronger than usual, and hooks abound.  Just about every song has worthwhile aspects anda high level of attention to detail.  It is obvious to me that the band put a lot into this one, from picking a new producer to writing a collection of grade-A material.  Why only 4 stars then?  Well, Bandwagonesque is classic, and a high, high bar was set way back when.  If this came from anyone else, maybe 5 stars would be more in line.  For those of you who are new to Fanclub and have stumbled onto this page by accident, let me tell you, you have to buy either the best-of collection or Bandwagonesque, or both.  Really.  Then you will want all the rest.  I cheered when Nirvana kicked Michael Jackson off the charts in 1991 or whenever that was, but I would have cheered far more if Fanclub had subsequently booted Nirvana from those charts.  It could have happened- for all the Cobain-tragedy publicity, Fanclub writes better songs.   This band has been quietly and unpretetiously chugging along since 1990 at least, while nobody seems to really notice.  Give them your support, they are a treasure+music
Only For Die Hards+N+With Perverse, Mike Edwards set out to prove that Jesus Jones was more than a `sunny, breezy pop band', what he ended up proving was that if they weren't no one was interested. Sad to say, but pop hooks were what people expected from JJ, and actually there are some here, but they are smothered by industrial/techno gook. Stick with DOUBT, that's where JJ peaked, even if some claimed they had `sold out'. Here they are pushing the boundaries, but that doesn't always make for a great listening experience+music
ouch!! hearing this hurt my feelings+N+I'm a huge fan of pretty girls make graves. Their first two albums really rocked the joint. But I'm sorry to report that this album really doesn't add up. It just doesn't make much sense to me at all. There is none of that old magic which really made the other albums rock here!   instead they've gone for a really lazy, laid back style which doesn't hold yer interest. for example one song starts off with a crunchy rocking guitar riff, which sounds promising enough, but then it disappears and is replaced by a dull bass line and doesn't re-appear at all. They then get bored of the bass line and move on to something else at which point the song ends!! the whole album goes like that. Songs barely get going and then promptly end.  The second guitar play has disappeared to! which means you don't get that cool guitar interplay sound which defined their other albums ( I reckon he was the talented one). They've replaced 2nd guitar with a keyboard player who, i kid u not, puts samples of fireworks in one song!! (I've said enough)  C'mon people! lets have a bit of structure/effort/balls. I heard that andrea's vocals are shot n' the doc said she had to cool it down, so I can only assume they are trying to change their direction or something.. But they are heading in the direction of Dido or goldfrapp or something bad like that.   I've listened to the album about 12 times now and can honestly say not a single one really sticks out in my mind.. What d'you guys think about it?  I hope they get their acts together and recover from this droop.  It's like Henry Rollins Said "If you aint gonna put 110% in don't even bother" +music
THIS is Jay...+P+This is THE hottest Jay you'll ever hear.  Ever.  I got it the day it came out and I still play it like that day.  Jay was hungry. If you don't have it, shame on you..get it.  Enough said. +music
What a jam!+P+While I'm normally not a huge country fan, I enjoyed this album greatly. The songs had, for the most part, a Southern-rock feel, rather than a warbly cowboy tone. The version of &quot;Amazing Grace,&quot; done as a jam session with a huge group of famous musicians, was worth the price of the tape alone! :c+music
Start With Acme!+N+While some would call Orange and Acme "studio" albums, suggesting that they lack originality, but they have rythm. I would call myself a big JSBX fan, I play Orange and Acme constantly, however I feel that this album is a little too much free form, and free noise for the everyday listener. I would recommend that anyone interested in JSBX start with Acme and then move on to Orange to develop an appreciation for JSBX, because it is a rather acquired taste+music
KILLER Songwriting!+P+This has got to be one of my favorite new albums out right now.  I bought this a few weeks ago in NYC mostly based on the reviews comparing Feeder to Coldplay.  The comparison isin't entirely accurate.  But right now it seems everyone coming out who's British is being compared to Coldplay.   Feeder still sounds like Feeder but they've expanded their music as well as their lyrics.  One of the best tracks is track #3. It has Dougie Payne and Fran Healy of Travis doing background vocals.  It's simply awesome.  If you want a great record to hold you over until the new Coldplay and Travis, then get this.  But please, everybody stop comparing everyone to Coldplay!  Give these guys their own credit+music
SAME OLD BORING SOUND GETS OLD+N+TWO LESBIANS sing the same old tunes of music for the entire album.....your ear get so tired after all. Typical Japanese pop sound has always been like this. There is no KICK to the tune,.....The ONLY, and THE BEST J-POP Artist really IMPRESSED me was UTADA HIKARU. She is better than MOST Western Singers. I bought this CD, listned it only once, and got rid of it. John Lennon wanna bee not so original/creative "artist".+music
Eric Manages To Get Through The Hurricane+P+Eric's third effort is six years in the making.  I noticed that the only time a artist brings us some good music to the table is when their life's in shambles. But, without pain there's no way for us humans to channel that hurt without a medium.  Eric channels all that was tumultuous in his life into this wonderfully orchestrated album.  Many artists tend to use one musician to lay all tracks through synthesizers,moog programs, drum machines and consoles which in a way makes the consumer lose focus on the real content of the disc.  Majority of the disc is mostly based on self reflection.  He's made bad choices outside of his music career, but in this disc, he shows us that he finally got it together.  Be Myself is a self reflective piece on finding his true soul and sticking with it.  Pretty Baby is a personal fave due to the sensual background vocals.  The song also is a anthem for women to get it together and stop giving out the goods without showing some self respect for themselves.  Hurricane is another reflective piece that says to come and take the pain away and let him live the life that he feels he so richly deserve.  I Wanna Be Loved is a cry that says he want to be loved by that special woman.  The rest of the disc is good.  The cabaret infused track The Last Time totally throws off the sexy vibe, but everyone has an off quirky moment.  Nevertheless, it's a solid affair with just the right amount of angst, but enough self loving prose that clearly shines through and through.  Grade: A+music
raw music+P+it takes a couple of listenings to to figure out which songs are the catchy ones and which ones are the genuinely good ones. but either way, all of the songs have this unpolished sound that makes it feel as if you're listening to her around a campfire or something, even with all the special effects. 'make it hot' 'recomendations' 'after you left' 'sun' and 'body below' are my personal favorites+music
A Whole Lotta Soul+P+Okay, first I need to respond to a previous reviewer who gave this CD one star and stated...  "She Loves You~ Twilight Singers is the kind of music that I detest. It is wordy and pretentious and sounds like the lyrics are written to annoy rather then for the audience to enjoy."  "She Loves You", as clearly stated by most of the reviews here and Amazon's description of this CD, is an album of cover tunes.  Meaning, all songs writen by other people.  So your complaining about the verbosity of Greg Dulli in a review for this CD is...well...dumb.  Upon investigation into your previous reviews I noticed you gave 5 stars to a Nick Cave CD which is surprising because Nick can be pretty verbose and often times pretentious.  Bottom line, if you are here to talk trash about somebody at least listen to the CD first and be honest about it.    that being said...  Greg Dulli shows some pretty serious ambition with his choice of covers on "She Loves You" including the oddball "Hyperballad", the Billie Holiday classic "Strange Fruit", and Fleetwood Mac's "What Makes You think You're The One".  Onlike most cover albums, Dulli doesn't just pay lip service to the originals, he applies his unique soulfull paintbrush to each and makes them his own.    Most cover CDs are bad...this one isn't.  It's really, really good.  Buy it.+music
The illmatic of GANGSTA RECORDS+P+The album is straight raw. Kurupt's lyrical abilities are unmatched and go hand in hand with Daz's Delivery. The G-Funk beats are the best they've ever sounded. As a whole, you will not skip one song at all. A++music
Smooth Jazz at its finest+P+I heard some of Steve Coles music one day while listening to a satellite radio station. The music I heard was unbelieveable. Smooth Jazz sax full of soul. I ordered the CD thru Amazon and have been playing it ever since. A great part of any smooth jazz collection+music
boring....+N+my sister got this cd for christmas of '05, and i pray for the day that she stops playing it 24 hrs straight. I thought the music industry was starting to recover from the "boy band" era, until bands like, fall out boy, all american rejects, and the click five came out. Apparently life is ONLY about love to them, they NEVER sing about any other aspect of life. The click five is just another phase in the collapsing of the music industry. At this rate, originality in music, will be a time long lost+music
Alright, if you absolutely HAVE to have a Garfunkel solo album...+N+This one is for you.  But honestly now, the guy doesn't write--beautiful voice--but songwriting is a major appeal.  So  guess a solo garfunkel is a lot like a step above Justin Timberlake.  Ok, there are definitely highlihgts like a Heart in Newyork, (what a) wonderful world, but generally this a very casual compilation, good for a couple listens.  in general, Art Garfunkel isn't really good for more than that.  Check out him witht Paul Simon, that is amazing stuff, but this is kinda boring.  I might have a bit more respect if he wrote the songs--but even though there are good songwriters writing for him, the songs are still sub-par+music
This thug should be imprisoned+N+Inspector: Deux Deux, we place loser gangsta rapper Juvenile under arrest. Deux-Deux: What are the charges Inspector. Inspector: First, he trashed our President and FEMA on Get Your Hustle On. Deux-Deux: That is treason. Inspector: Rodeo and the rest of this album degrades women(Rodeo), glorifies violence and praises chronic and looting! Deux-Deux: In addition, he advocates domestic violence, robbery, murder and illegal substances. Inspector: Finally, he degraded his own fans at a record launch party by a)telling a girl at his album release party that "he didn't give a f--k about her and none of ya'll b*tch*s and just want you to support my music and buy it" showing he is a greedy money hungry thug, b) this loser got into a confrontation with a female at the club exposing him for being an insensitive hypocrite and finally got into a fistfight with a white DJ. Deux-Deux: Proves he is a bonafide racist(like Kanye West) with a very nasty and abusive attitude. If you want rap, buy Run-DMC or The Fat Boys+music
Once again - don't rent, BUY!+P+In 2005, Chris Columbus (Mrs. Doubtfire, Harry Potter, Home Alone, etc.) adapted Jonathan Larson's beloved rock opera from stage to film and did a grand job in it. This soundtrack is a product of the music heard in the movie, and it as just as better as ever.   With the usuals returning in 6 of the 8 main parts - Rapp, Pascal, Menzel, Diggs, Martin, and Heredia - there were still 2 parts left open as Daphne Rubin-Vega (Mimi) and Fredi Walker (Joanne) declined.   Fortunatley, this soundtrack features two amazingly beautiful voices from their replacements who many consider are as good, and in my personal opinion are better, than the first two gals. Tracie Thoms plays Joanne with dignity and a range that could knock someone over as she brings the house down with the famous high note in "Seasons of Love." Rosario Dawson (Sin City, Alexander) has the best performance of her career as Mimi, where she can sexily serenade any listener in "Out Tonight" and reduce some to tears in "Goodbye Love."  With most of the highlights sung in this film, some songs are better in this version; while songs here are in its Broadway's parallel's shadow. Then there are some songs on here that do justice to their counterpart and they are both equally good. Some improvments on this track are "Seasons of Love," "Rent," "Without You," "Santa Fe," "Tango Maureen," and "Will I?"  Overall, just go get it. It's amazing. Your ears will thank you+music
Cudos to Art !  Best Effort to Date !!!+P+First caught these three on " Live from the Bluebird Cafe ".When I bought the CD and listented to it for the first time I thought,Umm,kind of bland .After listening a few more times,all I can say is EXCELLENT !!! Excellent lyrics!! Excellent melodies!! Excellent Harmonies !! I hope these three pair up again !  Once more for the record EXCELLENT !!!                                        Ken Shelto+music
Shhh, don't tell anyone but Miles gives me a headache+N+Shhh, don't tell anyone but Miles and his "in your face" trumpet give me a headache.   I like funk and groove so I should have done a bit more homework before trying out the jazz scene. For me this CD is mostly silent except for some irritating trumpet blowing like foxtail into your eardrums.   I was about to give up on the whole jazz scene when I came upon Panthalassa. Track 1 of that CD (In a silent way/Shhh/Peaceful) is nice; smoothing out and grooving out Miles while staying true: say the purists.  If you love it remixed and electrofied (yes sir!) check out DJ Cam's tribute to "In a silent way".+music
A Worthwhile Purchase+P+More than just a one hit album, "I Wish" has enough pleasing and catchy tracks to merit a purchase.  The production values are high, with some great backup vocals and instrumental work.  In addition to "I Wish", "This Is How It Sounds" and "Crenshaw" are solid.  Really, other than the last track, "I Wish (Street Mix Version)", this is an entertaining album across the board with some interesting turns of phrase. Skee Lo's lyrics move at a fast cadence but flow with the back tracks nicely and pause from time to time to permit room for the background singers to jump in smoothly.  +music
Thank You Lonestar For Making The Most Annoying Song Ever!+N+I am baffled at how country music stations and fans of the horrible music can stand hearing Lonestar's "Mr. Mom" over and over again everyday. The song is as stupid as it is annoying, and the lyircs are extremely juvenile. Who had the horrible idea of writing a song about stay at home mothers? Lonestar, the manwomen of country. But what's worse is that Nashville and country radio declared it a hit and decided to play it 25 times per day. (And I thought that Tim McGraw's "Back When" was as bad as it could get)  Let's take a look at a few of the hillariously idiotic lyrics from this song:   "Football, soccer and ballet Squeeze in Scouts and PTA And there's that shopping list she left That's seven pages long How much smoke can one stove make The kids won't eat my charcoal cake It's more than any maid can take Being Mr. Mom  Well Pampers melt in a Maytag dryer Crayons go up one drawer higher Rewind Barney for the fifteenth time Breakfast, six naps at nine There's bubble gum in the baby's hair Sweet potatoes(they pronounce it PER-TAT-ERS) in my lazy chair Been crazy all day long and it's only Monday Mr. Mom"  I should seriously consider becoming a country artist. I can make my voice sound like a male country singer and I can write meaningless whitetrash songs, so all I have to do now is find someone to play steel guitar for me, and i'm gonna make it big as a star in Nashville and all over redneck USA. If you want to hear good country, stay with classics like Johnny Cash and Conway Twitty. Please pass on girly garbage and mindless hick mumbling+music
Junk.+N+Who the **ck are GNR?? Plus they make awful music! I can't stand this annyoing album. The music is awful, so as the lyrics. There is not ONE good song on this piece of s**t. It is a album that contains 12 crappy songs. AXL ROSE is a very annoying lead singer just screams and sings horribly, and SLASH is terrible too. In THE WAY STAY AWAY FROM THIS AS WELL AS GNRS OTHER ALBUMS. LEAVE GNR ALONE....GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS.

From a mexican Roxy Music fan+P+Definitely Avalon in one of my top 10 albums ever; this SACD version is amazing. I have listened to the remastered album thousand of times, but believe me, listening to the SACD album is another dimension and a whole new experience.  All the sonic treatments, a Roxy Music trademark are just wow!!!  Best regards to the fans,  Jose Curiel from Mexico Cit+music
No Slump Here+P+Gary Allan skipped the sophomore slump with his second album, something that usually plagues new artists, but he seems comfortable on his 1998 album IT WOULD BE YOU. The album has the right balance between uptempo honky tonks and touching ballads. The album opens with the title track, one of his stronger singles. &quot;No Man In His Right Heart&quot; recounts a night where a man turns down a woman's offer, an offer no other man would refuse. &quot;Don't Leave Her Lonely Too Long&quot; was co-written by Marty Stuart, its a fun honky tonk sure to please. &quot;I'll Take Today&quot; was another single from the album, a nice ballad about cherishing the time we spend in the present instead of relenting on the past. Other nice sentimental ballads include &quot;I Ain't Runnin' Yet&quot; and &quot;Baby I Will&quot;, and he does honky tonk on &quot;I've Got A Quarter In My Pocket&quot; and &quot;Red Lips, Blue Eyes, Little White Lies&quot;. The album closes with &quot;Forgotten But Not Gone&quot;, a beautiful ballad, one of the best on the CD. There's also a hidden track called &quot;Judgement Day&quot; which is worth listening to. Overall this is a nice album, I think better than his first, so give it a listen+music
the awesomest  album ever!+P+Dude, nobody rocks it like the Hoff! as hard as it may be to believem his musical talents actually equal-maybe even surpass-his skills as a thespian!   I was first exposed to the Hoff's amazing vocal talents when he guest starred on the classic series, KIDS, incororated. Imagine how exciting it was for a young tyke to see Knight Rider singing on saturday morning TV! y'know, Knight Rider was probably the greatest series ever about a talking car, but they really dropped the ball by not having the Hoff sing more. maybe even a duet of the Hoff and KITT of ebony and ivory. Knight Rider would've been like 37 bajillion times awesomer if it was a musical like cop rock. cop rock rules!  but i'm not reviewing cop rock, I'm reviewing the Hoff's awesome retrospective album, which is a great overview of the Hoff's career, altho obviously, you're going yourself a disservice to not buy the original albums; a lot of great stuff there. But if you want an album that rocks the house, this is the one for you.  Dude, I hope when they do the movie of Knight Rider it's a musical. that'd be the awesomest movie eve+music
We need MOORE like this+P+Ian Moores selt titled debut, overall, is his best output, and judging by his new found musical style, will remain so. I could'nt honestly understand all the hoo-haa about the SRV guitar similarities. When we are talking about SRV Clones, we are talking about Sunset Heights,Indigenous,Scarlet Runner etc. On this debut, there is not one bit of evidence about ripping off SRV. None of the songs are straight out Blues Songs. They are in fact a mixture of Rock and Soul. Ian has now gone on the trek of leaving behind his guitar hero status and concetrating on his fine song-writing talent and his gifted soulful voice. No weak tracks on this CD at all which cannot be said about any other Ian Moore CD. Ian's Vocalist heroes all stem round the golden era of RnB with Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye etc to the fore. You can really feel his emotions when he sings, and this can't really be said about SRV in the same way. I saw Ian at the small prestigeous London club "The Borderline" on JULY 4 1994, and it still rates as one of the best concerts I have seen in my entire life. Although I was a little bit disappointed that he didnt include my personal fave on the CD (i.e. Revelation), as it was only a 60 min support slot to Omar and the Howlers. He in fact included 2 or 3 cover versions including "Me and my guitar" and "Spanish Castle Magic". Ian would later appear at Wembley Arena in support to ZZ Top (Capacity approx. 15000), but the only thing Ian had in comparison to La Trio Grande is that they both hail from Texas. A better support slot would have been to Bryan Adams as an example. Ian later went on to write 2 more albums with the Original band (Modern day Folklore AND And all the Colors), and from those albums came 4 amazing tracks (Today,Coming around, Time of dying and Fickle). He would also release a Minil Live Album (Live in Austin) with the Original LIne-up as well which includes 2 or 3 songs from the debut as well as "Me and my guitar". I heard a rumour that Ian never made it because he was "Too Hollywood" with his pretty boy looks etc. I met Ian at the Borderline gig, and he was vey Humble, calm and polite with no sign of ego or arrogance. I really do hope we get the chance again to hear Ian play some REAL Blues music, and let the world know what really could have been. Either way, I wish him all the best+music
Great blues rock, good voice+P+I had this album on my shelf for years (along with Modernday Folklore) and I just broke them out again; I forgot how good they are. I can't stop playing them right now. He really knows how to break it up by picking up the pace and slowing it down. I bought if for "Blue Sky" which was played on the radio at the time but the others are great, too. "Harlem" is your socially conscious rock tune, but one great piece of music+music
HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT+N+I'm a really big Christina fan.  Hands down, she is one of the most talented singers and has one of the best voices out there.  This album is mostly filled with mediocre music with nothing artiscically original and drab lyrics.  It would be nice if she quit the persona facades and came out as a pure artist and just acted herself instead of a role.  Although there are a couple of good tracks, the rest are filler.  I was really disappointed with the outcome of this album. +music
Who Mike Jones? Who Cares?+N+Mike Jones isn't anything different. Still Tippin is talking about what every other rapper has already covered. Who cares if your "tippin" on 4 4s? All the other songs are just basic rap songs with no real meaning. Also, how many times does this guy need to say his name or give out his phone number?+music
A tribute that doesn't deliver+N+I was SO MOVED when I first watched Hedwig that I bought the DVD, Soundtrack and Broadway Soundtrack.  What a masterful bit of writing and performance; just astonishing.  After I listened to this tribute, I just couldn't write a positive review.  The magic and emotion is not there.  The feeling is gone.  I know this review is short, but not much really needs to be said other than:  Save your money and buy the original+music
dizzy up+N+I don't listen to this kind of music as I really hate the whole radio/alternatine scene.  I worked in a music store when this album was released and must have heard it 5 or 6 times a day as we had to play new releases in the store.  Although there is no talent in this band vocal or instrument wise, the music made me reminisce about high school days.  Anyway, this was a flavor of the day type band who has been forgotten about by now.  It was obviously a group created by music execs to have some radio play, milk every dime that it was worth and then thrown out like old chewing tobacco.  It's such a shame how music is being ruined like this.+music
Horrible!!!!+N+George Benson can be one of the best guitar players, make some of the best recordings, and sound so good, if he wanted to. If you think George Benson is any kind of jazz, you'd be right. He even started out playing straight ahead jazz. But by no means, is this a jazz album.                                         Many of the songs on here are horrible R&B with vocals, by Benson. That's ok if that's what you like, but I curtainly dont. We already got enough R&B vocalists. Benson is a talented man! Why does he have to lower himself to play this garbage.                     The only good song on this CD is Softly, As In A Morning Sunrise; and that's questionable. No, George Benson did not pull it off with his latest effort. Benson, you gotta play some jazz.                                          Any thing else, but this. Lay off the R&B vocals and show the world what a talented jazz guitarist you are+music
A harmonic sound all their own +P+'The Mamas and the Papas' had a sound all their own, a unique kind of Southern California blend, a harmony of at times melancholy beauty. They had one great singer, Mama Cass, whose 'Dream a Little Dream of me' is perhaps the closest thing they ever produced to a really great 'solo'. Their signature song and one of the unforgettable sixties song is 'California Dreaming'. It seemed to express a certain haunting longing , the longing for a place which then represented to many Americans, California, the golden land of escape and new home.  John Phillips who like Mama Cass is no longer with us was the arranger, director who really made the 'Mamas and Papas' into such a great group.  It is strange even then their sound evoked a certain feeling of 'nostalgia' but four decades later the jump of initial joy hearing them brings is truly complemented by the sense of a world long gone.+music
Fits the movie...+N+High marks for accompanying the nature of the film well (pure action), but I miss the subtlety of the previous soundtracks..+music
WE CAN DREAM, CAN'T WE? {*Yeah, sure.*}+P+Richard Carpenter has expressed a slight dissatisfaction in HORIZON, and although I am a HUGE fan of The Carpenters {*He exaggerates; don't listen to him. He weighs about 165.*} I fear I must concur with Richard's assessment.  This collection is akin to finding a few purebred Golden Retrievers running with a pack of common dogs. {*A really bad analogy, Stephen! Remember, man, this is the world's greatest singer you're talking about here.*}  The album opens and closes with the very brief, atmospheric mood pieces, AURORA and EVENTIDE - so good you're actually left disappointed that they weren't expanded. In between is the memorable, but widely available hit, ONLY YESTERDAY, and the haunting SOLITAIRE.  Unquestionably, the big knockout track here is the dreamy, I CAN DREAM, CAN'T I, and this is really saying something when you consider that this collection also includes Karen's heartfelt reading of Frey & Henley's movingly plaintive and lyrically brilliant, DESPERADO - a song that would be the major highlight on any number of other albums!  Richard once lamented that had he only known how little time he and his sister would have together, they wouldn't have wasted any of it recording songs like Beechwood 4-5789. Although it went to Number 1 on the U.S. charts, and was a runaway monster in Japan {*You mean like Godzilla?*}, I have to believe that Richard would have included PLEASE MR. POSTMAN in this lamentable category.  It's just pure radio fluff; about as satisfying as a Popsicle! For me, the other three cuts (#7, 8 & 9) are nearly equally forgettable.  Oh, but did I mention, I CAN DREAM, CAN'T I? {*Forgive him, folks. He's starting to get long in the tooth, and one's memory is always the first thing to go!*} It's bittersweet. Sweet in that Karen's exquisite, intimate voice and delicious delivery are perfectly framed by the crystalline, rock candy piano at the forefront and by the warm, melty, white chocolate strings in the background! {*Stephen, you hungry maybe?*} It's just GORGEOUS! A light wisp of smoke, tenderly wrapped in gauze and gently placed in a bed of softly folded lace. And it's bitter in that this is the only taste of it that we are ever going to get. Just a glimpse of an unrealized potential. What a treasure we would have possessed if The Carpenters had recorded an entire album of time-tested standards with similar stylistically luscious arrangements. It could have been called CLASSIC KAREN and included songs such as, Stardust; You Belong To Me; Misty; September Song; and Smokin' In The Boy's Room. {*SMOKIN' IN THE BOY'S ROOM?!!*} No, I meant, Smoke On The Water. {*SAY WHAT?!*} Smoke Gets In Your Eyes? {*Yeah, well that's a little more like it. Man, they'll let just about anybody post reviews on Amazon, won't they?*} But I suppose it's better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all. {*Good line, Stephen, but it sounds familiar.*} Alas, we're never going to get CLASSIC KAREN, but still we can listen to this one shimmering moment over and over, and we can dream, can't we? {*Yeah, I know he's kind of sappy, but you get used to him.*}  In addition to the music, there are two REALLY NICE photos of Karen on the front and back cover {*Alright, Stephen, take it easy!*} and musically, the mountaintops are so majestic on this slightly uneven recording that they cast their shadows down into the valleys and render them passable. If you are new to The Carpenters, you could do worse than this collection, and if you are already a fan, then purchasing this compact disc should be on your immediate HORIZON. {*Ok, you done now? Let's log off, get out of these pajamas, and go get something to eat already. Man, I'm starving!*} +music
D-e-l+N+I remember around 1991, NBA Inside Stuff did a feature on B.J. Armstrong (my favorite player) of the Chicago Bulls.  B.J. said that his favorite song was "Mr. Dobalina".  I remember thinking, well, if B.J. Armstrong likes this guy named Del tha Funkee Homosapien, then he must be good.    And yes, Del's first album "I Wish My Brother George Was Here" is an absolute hands-down hip-hop classic.  So I recommend that album over this one (it's cheap too).  Del was at his creative peak with that first album;  it featured great production from Ice Cube (back when Ice Cube made good albums instead of movies).    Since then, his career's been a mixed bag.  His CD's are very inconsistent.  A Best Of CD is probably a good way to get an overview of those mixed-result cd's.    But I think you'd also be better off buying "Deltron 3030" and "I Wish My Brother George..." instead+music
Steady At [not Fumbling Towards] Mediocrity+N+Too boring to ever really loathe, McLachlan has long remained on that cusp of mediocrity and frustration - hints of beauty surface here and there every few years, but the compendium is always the same - dull songs, listless vocals, uninspiring and lazy musical arrangement. Nothing here as breathtaking as `Ben's Song' or `Possession' or `Do What You Have To Do', but we have a host of replicates of the dreaded `Angel' and `Into The Fire' and `Solace' and any other countless fungible melodies from her pretty-enough canon. She might or might not be a hack, but if she is, she's a fancy hack.  My grade:  C+music
A dark ride+P+Rosanne Cash's meditation of the loss of life and love (her father, Johnny; her stepmother, June Carter Cash; and her mother, Vivian Cash Distin) is her darkest album since the divorce chronicle of "Interiors." She calls into question both God and herself on such songs as "House on the Lake" and the title track. Like some of Emmylou Harris' best work (like the recent "Red Dirt Girl"), Rosanne has moved to the far fringe of country and given her music an both a dose of intelligence atmospheric edge. You won't find any lighthearted 'redneck girl' stompers here. In fact, "Radio Operator" is probably the closest thing to a generic country song on "Black Cadillac."  This is a good thing. Cash refuses to bend to anyone's rules (much like she has on some of her other great records and "Rules Of Travel). She delivers both her grief and her resolve simply and elegantly on "Dreams are Not My Home" and gives a reality check face slap to bickering lawyers on "Like Fugitives" and a reaffirmation of life/faith on "God Is In The Roses." To say that "Black Cadillac" is merely a tribute to her lost family members is selling the CD short. Rosanne is, like the Dixie Chicks, Slaid Cleaves, Emmylou Harris or even her father's "American Music" series, making country music for thoughtful adults+music
Another Great from the Great Todd Rundgren+P+Great remake of the Cars great toons and only Todd could do it!!! the vocals and the mixes are fantastic!!+music
Remakes - NOT ORIGINAL recordings+N+If you're looking for the sound of the original recordings, look to a different CD.+music
Fluffy Pretentiousness+N+HelloGoodbye has a sound that's really in vogue right now. The problem is they forgot that no amount of 'being hip' can replace 'tired cliche writing'. In many regards - most of the songs on the album could have been sung by a female pop group in the 90s and it would have sounded perfectly in place (especially Touchdown Turnaround (Don't Give Up On Me) which is borderline annoying).  The band also needs to adopt a more singular sound. The point is an album is supposed to be cohesive, and the swtich from more traditional instrumentations to songs and a purely synth base instrumentation makes the alubm sound like two bands fighting for the attention of the listeners.  In many ways, it's almost as if the band wanted to be both phases of the band Depeche Mode at once. In case you don't listen to Depeche Mode, their early releases were very light and poppy and purely synth base, such as the song "Just Can't Get Enough." However, at some point (I usually point it around the single Blasphemous Rumours), the band became much more darker and eventually became a more traditional rock band in the sense that their albums were dominated by guitars. Then they went back to synths while keeping the darker sound.  The problem is that the band accomplishes neither very well, and even if they did, the two sounds don't together at once.  Then comes the lyrics. Their songwriter employs cliches and shows that he understands the basics of how to rhyme. For instance, "Everywhere and everytime/ I am yours and you are mine" from Touchdown Turnaround. The other lyrics are just as simplistic - just like "I like where we are/ when we drive in your car" from Here (In Your Arms). The author doesn't know how to express love in a manner that doesn't come off as very niave and simplistic, as if stating the obvious makes for great song lyrics.  They are not terrible. They just simply are nothing special. It just sounds as if they are taking the hip sound and forgetting what made that sound was hip was quality song writing. And they just don't bring that to the table. The only thing they bring to the table are two guilty pleasures...  sadly Touchdown Turnaround and Here. If the songwriter can get a bit deeper with his lyrics and the band chooses a sound they could put out a nice piece of pop fluff. As it stands, this album is nothing but fluffy pretentiousness.  Remember rule #1 of music - it should never sound like you are trying. It should just sound natural. And it sounds like these guys tried hard+music
His Best!+P+This is by far his best album.  He goes for meaningful yet witty lyrics and the music is a mix of old and new.  I can't stop listening to this one!!  My favorites are "Slow Dancing in a Burning Room" and "I Don't Trust Myself".  This young man has had a lot more life experience than his age would suggest.  We need him around for a long time!!+music
Not a good purchase+N+I found this an odd CD.  It had Italian operatic type songs and then pop songs.  It made my wonder who Josh Grobin thinks he is+music
I think that the song lips of an angel should be renamed "I'm just not that into you or my girlfriend either"+N+Extreme behaviour? I think not.  Perhaps extremely bad lyrics.  Was this dude stoned when he wrote the lyrics or really that shallow?  I just love that romantic song that they play on the radio all the time about the dude that's cheating on his girl friend w/ another woman and they dare to call it lips of an angel?  Could it get any sicker? I think the song should be retitled Welcome to Hell+music
Give this a wide berth+N+What a hateful album this is. Each song, a classic in it's own right, eviscerated by this glorified club singer. The song "It was a very good year" illustrates my point, you hear Williams's voice, and it's dire, but then to have Sinatra sing on the same song so you can compare the two was folly indeed.   I would be surprised if this sells even one copy, especially since the originals can be purchased for far less than this. Which fool would therefore choose the talentless imitator over the original? Do yourself a favour and buy the originals if you like these songs, if you buy this people will point at you in the street and laugh+music
very good+P+I don't know much about Danielle's genre of music but I thought this was a very good album and she sounds as good as any other female pop star out there.  Why she hasn't had the break-through I have no idea.  The lyrics are interesting and she sings with a great deal of power.  Her cover of "Gimme Some Sign" was excellent. +music
Big Black did a good cover once of Cheap Trick's 'He's a ...+N+Whore." Cheap Trick fans should check it out+music
A Different Kind of Cold+P+I have been a long time fan of Cold.  The newer more mellow Cold is definately the best sound they have produced yet.  The third album "Year of the Spider" is not too far behind and that is for sure, but the old cold was not as emotional and vocally talented as the the new Cold.  Cold has lost some talent intramentally, yet I don't see this as a bad thing.  Scooter Ward is so talented vocally there is no need for instruments to attempt to drown him out.  Give ward the stage!  This fresh sound from cold is certainly implemented in the title track, as it is only ward and his beloved piano for the most part of the song.  The intruments are there but there is certainly no need.  The song writing ability of Ward can not be matched by anyone in the rock genre.  This is a kind of parent-friendly grunge-flavored soft rock that 1-ups every kind of alternative rock out there which seems to be all screams and F-bombs nowadays.  If you like rock this is the album for you.  If it doesn't hit the spot the first time try round two and you will agree+music
Amateurish, style over substance+N+This pianist is painful to watch and boring to hear. We can only hope he is not the idol of a new generation of classical music listeners. It would be a bad omen for the future ...+music
Rachmaninov: Piano Concerto No. 2; Paganini Rhapsody+P+The best interpretation of this piano concerto I have ever heard.  Smooth, silky and precise, this is super pianomanship+music
Un-unique New York+N+I came across LEVY's profile on a popular personals/music website, and I found nothing but good reviews and great comments, so I decided to spend my extra birthday money on their album.  As I sat and listened to it, I kept wondering if I accidentally received the wrong CD; everything I heard sounded like Coldplay.  Now, I don't have anything against cover bands, but when you copy someone else's music, you should at least give them proper respect and acknowledge that you've made their music into your own.  On this album, LEVY mimicked much of the trademark guitar sound and texture of Coldplay.  Much of their personally filtered reviews taunt their work as completely original, and at times, they even sound as if LEVY might be musically revolutionary or something.  In regards to the actual musical content of the album, I find it lukewarm, stale and, well, plain boring.  Steer clear of this one if you're looking for something new and different.  After seeing several reviews stating this Kenny Anderson guy wrote my review, I figured I should add a realname tag to show that more than just Kenny Anderson thinks Levy sucks+music
They Write Theme Songs Good, Unfortunately, That Doesn't Count For Anything+N+All this is iis a bunch of 1:00 long songs that are all crap. They should have put This Might Be A Wiki or at least Boss of Me on here. But, unfortunately, it's a FLOP! FLOP! FLOP! Useless noise!      LOCAL CRAZY MONKE+music
"Ya ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight?"+P+Just to make things clear, I've never owned any Prince albums, and therefore can't consider myself a fan. Most people seem to judge these songs by comparison to his other work, but I'm speaking from a completely neutral point of view when I say: This album is great! I remember I bought this back in the early 90s thinking it was Danny Elfman's score to the film, and returned it when I realized it was actually a soundtrack by Prince. So, over a decade later, when I read that Jack Nicholson himself supported the use of Prince's talent for some of the movie's music, I figured why not give it a shot? I figured right!  All nine tracks have their own style and place, but the best ones are full of dance-able funk and hook, like "The Future", "Electric Chair", "Partyman", "Trust", and "Batdance" (you gotta dig that breakdown). It has that feel-good electronic goove that's the epitome of 80's pop music. And as a nice little touch, there are several songs that use audio clips from the film (namely Nicholson's Napier/Joker character) that really keep the Bat-atmosphere alive. I've long been a fan of Gotham's characters as well as Jack Nicholson, and now, through this, I think Prince may hold a spot on my list. Basically said, "Batman" The Soundtrack is a must for anyone who loved the movie+music
Boo.... hiss!+N+This is good hip-hop music, but that's ALL it is.  The infectious tango track from the movie, (which was even used again for the title page on DVD), is conspicuously NOT there, nor any waltz, rumba or other ballroom music tracks that were in the movie.  I THOUGHT THIS WAS A MOVIE ABOUT URBAN SCHOOL KIDS WHO LEARN BALLROOM DANCING!  Sure, the hip-hop tracks should be there too because that was an integral part of the film, but that was only about half the music in the film.  And in this case, the absence of ballroom dancing tracks, for a movie specifically about ballroom dancing is unforgivable.  There should be a disclaimer on the cover of this CD to warn away anyone looking for the great, danceable tango, waltz, etc. tracks that were in the film. +music
Rod is an entertainer now...+N+...not a musician.  What I see in the negative reviews is a desire for Rod the Musician to return to old form. What I detect in the positive reviews is an enjoyment of Rod as an entertainer. Some people value musical chops and creativity- others simply want to be nostalgic and entertained. Rod converted long ago from  musician to Vegas entertainer.  If you want a taste of some old rockers who remain creative musicians, sample Robert Plant's or Neil Young's latest. Don't waste your time on Rod or this kitsch+music
Avoid+N+Aside from the song, "Brother", this CD is not worth your money. I'm not attacking these guys on a personal level, but anyone that appreciates music will see this CD has no flow. It sounds as if a few guys got together and created some decent riffs and then hastily hired a singer to apply lyrics so they could pump the thing out. The result is just as I said; a few good bass and guitar riffs and lyrics with religious overtones and no feel to the whole thing. There is nothing clever or conceptual about their music. Nothing lasting or memorable. Nothing worth your hard earned $. If this band has as much talent as the reviews that I read here all seem to say, where is the 2nd release? There won't be one+music
Great as usual+P+While stadium-rock dinosaurs like the Rolling Stones and U2 have been embarassing themselves putting out crappy albums and playing Super Bowl halftime for years, Sonic Youth have continued to put out unpredictable, diverse, and all-around excellent abums under the radar.  Rather Ripped continues the band's recent resurgence, as it contains all of the shimmering, mature (I hate that word most of the time, but it really does fit here) beauty that marked Murray Street and Sonic Nurse, while containing enough departures to prove the band's well of ideas is far from dry.  Thurston, Lee and Co. have obviously put a lot of effort into ensuring that the band's sound doesn't become calcified, but at the same time this is still unmistakably a Sonic Youth album, as Rather Ripped doesn't do any cribbing from the countless imitators that have emerged in the wake of the early-'90's alternative boom.  The twin-guitar interplay between Lee and Thurston is as dense and intricate as ever, but as on the previous Murray Street and Sonic Nurse, it's focused less on rearranging your brains Daydream Nation-style than on creating warm, inviting tones that mix with Steve Shelley's increasingly nuanced and jazzy drumming to create some of the band's most hypnotic soundscapes yet even as their overall sound becomes more streamlined and accessible (that's not to say there isn't still the occasional freakout to be found; witness the classic instrumental break on the opening Reena).  The band certainly hasn't stopped rocking, but they've somehow managed to do it in a consistently intelligent and sophisticated way even as their catalog has expanded to around the 15-album mark.  Really, that's the neatest trick of all in the Youth's 21st-century renaissance-the songs on Rather Ripped are easily among their most user-friendly, but there's more than enough attention to detail, and enough individual touches to each track, to keep their more discriminating fans coming back for more.    After the merely good Reena, Rather Ripped really takes off, as the next three songs are all among the Youth's best in recent memory, and different enough from each other to show a different facet of their sound at each turn.  The catchy, poppish Incinerate gives way to the eerily minimal, almost pastoral Do You Believe in Rapture? before the album skids into more aggressive territory with the thudding backbeats and sneering, vitriolic vocals of Sleeping Around.  Between them, these three songs encompass much of what has kept Sonic Youth relevant well into their third decade of existence, as they all strike a balance between their old status as noise-rock pioneers and their new position as seasoned elder statesman at a time when virtually all of their contemporaries have long since either faded out or imploded.  Thurston's vocals have become more self-assured and evocative than ever-even in his quieter moments, there's a level of confidence and depth that wasn't there in the band's early days.  Similarly, Kim's vocals have evolved into a smoky, mid-ranged tone that serves her much better than the high-pitched annoyances she used in the Daydream Nation-Goo-Dirty era.  Lee's obligatory contribution isn't wasted either, as his dark, confrontational Rats is another highlight.  The hard-driving Pink Steam goes for five mintues before the first words come out of Thurston's mouth, but vocals or no vocals, the song's complex arrangements and dense riffage speak volumes on their own.  Or closes the album on a nicely quiet, contemplative note, with Thurston intoning his lyrics in a near-whisper, although it's not without its share of dissonance in the background.    While you could pretty much insert this quote into a review of the band's last two albums (in fact, I might have), Rather Ripped once again shows Sonic Youth expanding their sound into more accessible territory without abandoning the creative drive that made them so compelling in the first place.  Definitely a worthy pickup, and I for one can't wait to see what they come out with next.  On another note, I saw these guys live last night in Boston, and many of the songs on this album come across even better in a concert setting, so if can catch them, do it.  Granted, they did make a reference to last night's show being the conclusion of their tour, so it may be a little late.  But whatever, they're still worth seeing+music
Not as good as his 3 previous salsa albums+N+*** stars - can't change the above!  Valio is a rearrangement of some of the songs of Amar sin Mentiras. And it definitely has the feeling of an afterthought.  While it is a pretty  decent salsa album (albeit brief), it is simply not in  the class of his other three salsa CD's, Todo a su Tiempo, Contra la Corriente, and especially, Libre. The arrangements are standard competent rather than thorougly innovative and unique  as were the older ones.+music
Don't get this if you don't like true Punk . . .+P+If you don't like Punk, not the Green Day junk, true anti-social punk music that kicks you in the face, don't get this album.  If you like music that grates on you, pisses you off, and is generally anti-social get this album.  It is a reincarnation of all that is Fing great with punk, grating vocals and thrash.

Dylan's Most Overrated Album+N+I just don't get why people like this album. It stinks. "Sara" is Dylan at his whiny worst. "Mozambique" was the result of a drunken bet about how many words Dylan could rhyme with Mozambique. And the worst thing of all on the album is Rivera's screeching violin on every track. About her: Dylan was riding in a limo and saw her walking on the street with a violin case. He liked the way she walked so he picked her up and promised to allow her to play on his album. And so it goes. "Bringin' it all Back Home" this ain't.   I am a huge Dylan fan and have most of is catalogue, but this is the one album of his that I just can't stand. Not one song works.  If you are new to Dylan , get "Bringin it all Back Home", "Highway 61", "Blonde on Blonde", and "Blood on the Tracks". If you already have those, there are about 20 more to get before you bother with this one.  Oh, and one more thing: Reuben Carter was guilty+music
SHOOK ONES PT II+P+That song alone made this group hard and it is a classic song. I never bought their debut album because they looked too young and too inexperienced but this album changed all that with this song and couple others on here and put them on the map.

A Timeless Classic+P+"Step In The Arena" did feel a lot like an debut album than a sophmore release, not taking anything away from "No More Mr. Nice Guy" but that album was more like a demo record.  Whereas "Step In The Arena" was a peek into the future as to what was to come later for GangStarr.  Guru's veteran type flow/hungry new coming MC intensity and Premier's bass heavy jazzed out beats made this album a timeless classic which could go toe-to-toe with the new material being release today.  Any true hiphop head needs to have this CD in their collection.+music
Cash In Now, Honey!+N+A cynical grab for more moolah. "Wow! These guys are real rebels with something real to say!" Sorry, this re-recording exposes them as the poseurs they apparently always were. Hey guys, how about writing some NEW music? Oh, that's right. Whatever spark you had went out decades ago.    I'm sure I would still have a good time seeing them live, but sadly, they have turned into a nostalgia act. Even the cover is a tired, boring re-hash. This GIFT should be returned+music
It's a Roller-Coaster Ride That Never Stops+P+Whenever I listen to this album I think I'm at an amusement park and I'm going on these fun rides. The orchestrations for La Cage aux Folles are excellent and so is the sound quality. I will never stop listening to this musical until I am at old age. Everybody who is anybody should have this musical because this musical has extreme spirit that never halts until perhaps the 2 ballads here in this show. I could be riding on a motorcycle when listening to all these upbeat numbers and I'd stop at a red light during the ballads. Man, this show is even better than Hello, Dolly and/or Mame only because they don't have as extreme an excitement as La Cage aux Folles. In my opinion, this musical is like no other Jerry Herman musical, a musical with music to be played at amusement parks (especially the rollercoasters)+music
Micheal Sullevan knows nothing about punk+N+This joker called blink-182 punk!!!!!!!! Give me a break, This is emo, And not punk. There are a few bands on here i like. But the rest is crap+music
Nobody cares what school Michael Sullivan or "Tom" went to+N+First off, the Atticus collections never feature great music; with the exception of the occasional song. Hate to break everyone's hearts.  This one in particular is chock fulla corny, sappy, pop-punk goodness. Not that it's not fun to listen to, but (and like I said, with certain exceptions) there's nothing on here that you couldn't see on MTV and make a mixtape out of. Taking 15 bands, half of them sub-par, and putting together a collection of the only single (if you can call it that) off their latest lame album doesn't make a quality recording.   If you're looking for something a bit more edgy, try picking up the complilations put together by the indie labels themselves of the best songs from their artists. Because this is usually where you're going to find stand-out tracks that you can really appreciate for the fact that you like it, not because blink-182 says they're cool (and no disrespect because I love blink too). That's just my advice. To everyone who does really enjoy the music on here that's cool too. I'd still rather hear Dragging The Lake blaring out of someones car than the newest DJ Kay Slay or Funkmaster Flex mixtape that's for sure, or should I say, fo sho.   And to the previous reviewer who commented that the worst track on the album is Saosin's Bury Your Head; if you had any musical taste beyond Blink or MXPX because they're "frickin awesome" you'd know that Anthony Green is one of the most respected vocalists in the independant scene. Saosin's Translating The Name EP featuring Green on vocals is held by many as one of the best independant debut EPs of all time. If you want further proof, download the acoustic version of Seven Years and tell me if you can think of another emo-vocalist with anywhere near the same range. It's always better to open your ears before you open your mouth. +music
Grey Gardens Glistens+P+Grey Gardens is well-written show, with a fine score. This album contains brilliant comic performances, as well as pathos. Reminds us that the Bouviers and the Kennedys were quirky families, just like all of our own. The Revolutionary Costume for the Day number at the top of Act II is utterly devestating, rendered by the brilliant Christine Ebersole, who plays Mother in Act 1, and her own Daughter in Act II+music
A Must Have For any Johnny Cash Fan+P+One of the greatest albums ever released.Johnny sings from his heart & the Man in Black will live on forever. Pet+music
Not my favorite but still 5 stars.+P+Lets face it its a two major hit album.   Still that plus the big pay off experimentation are worth 5 stars against anyone you can think of.+music
Doesn't quite hit the mark+N+I've purchased the original PCM encoded CD more than once because I enjoy this album so much.  I was happy to see this album release in surround sound but was disappointed by the lack of content and very disappointed with the fact that I still can't figure out how to fast-forward through songs on the 5.1 side of the disc.  Why would you disable that option?  I guess the people who made the disc had a lot of extra time on their hands from not having to add extra content to the CD.  The recording label obviously wants the quick income of reselling this album without having to put any effort into remixing it or adding content+music
Not worth it+N+Jessica Simpson is through being famous for her "talent" and is now known primarily for her sex appeal and stupidity.  When she started out years ago in the music business, she had a pretty good singing voice.  Now she's filled up her CD's with bubble-gum lyrics and a breathy, whispery, off-key voice.  Where other artists have grown in their musical talent, Jessica appears to have stayed the same, and maybe even gone downhill.  I don't feel that this CD is worth the price. +music
so very disappointing+N+I'm a loyal Orton fan; Trailer Park is her best, and I'm a fan the "other side of daybreak". This cd is a complete disappointment. It is trite, boring, and political in a very dull and usual way; it has none of the distinctive thoughtfulness, charm, and melancholy that so characterize most of Orton's work. I get the distinct feeling that she didn't have this cd in her, but just put it out there because there were so many (ourselves) who were waiting. Orton's merit is that her songs come from her heart; these songs come from her head. These songs sound little different from so much soulless folk-pop, and have all the authenticity of a millionaire rockstar whining about being downtrodden.  We wish Beth the best; but we also wish she would give us her best; and if she can't do that, well, we'll be content with her 'classics'+music
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA+N+This looks so hilarious!  How did you lose Jessica Simpson you dolt?!  What a loser, now he'll be relegated to the back of page six and then gone forever, way to use 'em and lose 'em Simpson. +music
Sloppy+N+Sloppy, trite lyrics, way too much quitar. These guys don't know what their doing. Massively over-rated.  Belle and Sebastian are 100 times better than this crap band+music
Great CD.+P+I am loving this one! Most every song is a "keeper" and they all make me want to dance.+music
The Greatest Prince Album+P+The album "Sign `o' the Times" by Prince is one of my ALL-TIME favorites. Not many people I encounter know anything about this CD and that is beyond shameful because they are missing out on one of the trippiest and most joyful musical experiences known to mankind. HOW'S THAT FOR HYPERBOLE?  Let's break it down....  01) SIGN `O' THE TIMES: This is a fantastic slow and spooky funk tune that waxes philosophical about such society ills as aids, gang violence, drugs, hurricanes, murders, poverty, war and even space shuttle explosions. Much like John Lennon's song "Imagine", this tune is just as relevant in 2006 as it was when originally released.  02) PLAY IN THE SUNSHINE: This is one of my fave Prince tunes ever. Musically, it sounds like a psychedelic gospel rave up and lyrically, it is all about trippin' on a natural high. FANTASTIC TRACK!  03) HOUSEQUAKE: Prince brings the fun big time with this tune. A mixture of James Brown, hip-hop and euro-dance-pop; HOUSEQUAKE is like nothing you've ever heard...and who else but Prince in his prime would toss out a "Green Eggs and Ham" reference in the middle of a mad-funky throw down?  04) THE BALLAD OF DOROTHY PARKER: This is a mellow funk groove that plays like a collaboration between Sly Stone and Joni Mitchell. I kid you not!  05) IT: After four fantastic tunes in a row, you'll be thinking "Man, this album is pure genius" but then comes this song. The only bleak spot on an otherwise exceptional album. "IT" is a meandering bit of danceable filler. Prince released a single b-side from this same period called "Shockadelica" that would have been much better in this position on the album.  06) STARFISH and COFFEE: This song begins with the sound of an alarm bell and proceeds to take us on a journey into the bizarre magic of childhood. Another one of my faves for it's sheer uniqueness.  07) SLOW LOVE: This is a sensual jazzy love ballad that features some magnificent trumpet solos.  08) HOT THING: What would a 1980's Prince album be without some blatant sexual innuendo? Well here it is furious and funky. The best part of this song is the saxophone work of Eric Leeds.  09) FOREVER IN MY LIFE: This is a slow romantic marriage proposal sung acapella with only the driving beat of a drum machine for accompaniment. Yet another one-of-a-kind song.  10) U GOT THE LOOK: A funk-rock masterpiece with some latin percussion driving the mix. This song is the "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" of dance music.  11) IF I WAS YOUR GIRLFRIEND: On this song, Prince writes in a conversational style as if telling his girlfriend that he wants a closeness with her that she usually reserves for her best girlfriend. One of the most interesting and daring lyrics you're likely to ever come across.  12) STRANGE RELATIONSHIP: Another out-of-the-ordinary lyric about a couple with a love / hate relationship that neither one can put an end to. Features the great chorus..."Baby, I just can't stand to see you happy / More than that, I hate to see you sad / Honey if you left me I just might do something rash / What's this strange relationship?"  13) I COULD NEVER TAKE THE PLACE OF YOUR MAN: This is guitar pop at it's best with a great lyric about actually turning down a woman's sexual advances. Features a terrific guitar solo / break down midway through the song.  14) THE CROSS: This is a song about overcoming the adversity in life through spiritual faith in but even if you're an atheist, you won't be able to deny the rhythmic and melodic power of this tune. It starts off slow, quiet and acoustic then builds to an all out rockin' climax.  15) IT'S GONNA BE A BEAUTIFUL NIGHT: This is a 9 minute jam-out track that was recorded live with Prince's unbelievable 80's band The Revolution...featuring Shelia E. on the drums. A truly remarkable funk experience that showcases Shelia E. rapping Edward Lear's classic poem "The Table and the Chair" in the middle of all the musical mayhem. Another one of my faver most faves!  16) ADORE: This amazing album comes to a end with this gorgeous classic-style r&b ballad.   WHAT A TRIP! If you've never heard this album, I strongly suggest that you check it out immediately and give your ears a sonic treat. Just skip song number 5+music
Brainwashed Anthem for the Neo-Conservatives+N+Wow.  Where do I even begin?  It is sad to think that so many Americans are as misinformed about Iraq and the war on terror as this Darryl Worley is.  First off, I don't know anyone who is saying "you shouldn't worry about Bin Laden."  If anything people against the war in Iraq wanted our government to spend more time and efforts tracking down al-Qaeda's leader.    The fact that Bush Jr. will not make the hunt for Bin Laden his #1 priority is one of the many reasons why millions of Americans voted for Kerry.  They want a leader who will stand up and protect us from the mastermind who attacked us and not send us on a wild goose chase like what Bush Jr. has unfortunatly done.  Think for once Darryl!   Next, if you are going to write a song about invading Iraq at least make references to it.  Also, now that the war in Iraq and our president's approval ratings are so low. I doubt Darryl Worley would ever make a sequel song about staying the course in Iraq.  He and his managers are probably thinking about the next tragedy to cash in on.  Hmmmm maybe he will $ing about Hurricane Katrina next...  We have spent so-far 500 billon dollars and more than that worth in human life lost in Iraq, all that in  a war that "ended" according to our president on May 1, 2003.  Perhaps, outsourcing jobs to other countries should be extended to crappy songwriters too.+music
No seriously. People actually buy this?+N+People buy fast food, they know its bad for them. People pay the Geek Squad 229 to do 5 minutes of work. People ALSO pay 10 bucks for words & techno beats called "pop music".  Amazing, if you had this much money: go get a gym membership. Pay off your cars. Donate it to children's hospital.  Why support some teen that in 2 years will die from the music scence and laugh in her mansion+music
You See Me CRYIN'...+N+Tho' Aerosmith's first greatest hits package wasn't perfect (lacking Train Kept a Rollin' and featuring edited AM single versions of a couple big hits), it still stands hair and shoulders above this "Second Coming of Aerosmith" mix. Where Dream On was a definitive power ballad of its era, Big Ones is overstuffed with the lame metal mellow-dies (Cryin', Amazing, Crazy) that have become the bad boys' schlock in trade.  I reckon chart peak/career low I Don't Wanna Miss a Thing will have to wait for Hits 3.  Even the so called rockers (the dumb and dumber Dude Looks Like a Lady and Love in an Elevator) can't hold a Bic lighter to fine, funky seventies fare Walk This Way and Same Old Song and Dance, and I refuse to dignify anything from Get a Grip with an insult.  it only gets worse, and sadder, after THAT album, folks.  What's the point of being the longest lived rock band after Mick and Keith if you're not even gonna ROCK anymore??? (Sigh)...call me "Jaded". RATING: TWO LIPS+music
Off to a good start+P+I am a Destiny's Child fan but I picked up this CD last because I didn't think its wasn't going to be that good. The vocals are awesome, suprising its not just Beyonce singing with background singers. Beyonce's voice wasn't stellar here whcih gives the Cd a different sound. Pick it up if you are a DC fan if not you'll probably still like it. Favs are Second Nature, With me pt1, both No, No, No's and Show me the wa+music
Lived up to my expectations!+P+I recently saw We Are Scientists open for the Arctic Monkeys at the Granada in Dallas and my, were they good! Usually, opening acts are disregarded, and We Are Scientists weren't taken with interest at first, but after just a song, everyone was singing and dancing. They are friendly guys (I met Keith after the show with my friends) with humorous personalities and clever bander and their lyrics, while simple at times, still make an impact amongst catchy and well-executed instrumentation.  +music
Is There A Law That Says You Can't Like Both Versions?+P+Apparently, there's an unwritten law that says you can't possibly like both versions of Primal Scream?  Well, I beg to differ!  I happen to dig both the groundbreaking psychedelic/electronica sounds of the "Screamadelica" and "Vanishing Point" discs as well as this far from innovative but still hugely enjoyable slice of retro-rock.  Fans of 70s-style hard rock with generous doses of funk, soul and blues will like this CD alot.  When it comes to music, variety IS the spice of life and diversity is more than welcome.  Expand your horizons...just because it's different from the rest of their catalog doesn't automatically make it a failure. +music
Not the best album for your next cocktail party unless you're born again+N+I own and really liked Ms. Chenoweth's previous album, I've enjoyed her on the stage, and I also like gospel music in general.   I don't think I'm anti-religion.  Still, this album was a bit of a shock.  It's a huge departure from her work to date and I hope just an aberration.  Wikipedia calls As I Am "a mixture of hymns and contemporary Christian music... with arrangements that sound similar to adult contemporary."  It also notes that "To promote the album, she made an appearance on The 700 Club." This was probably good marketing,  because the only place I have heard music comparable to this is on religious cable channels.   If you like lyrics about Jesus set to saccharine arrangements ("Because he lives, I can face tomorrow"), you will enjoy this album.  What was she thinking?   Incidentally, if you are looking for really strong reinterpretations of great gospel songs, CDs by the late Eva Cassidy contain some better choices.  Taylor the Latte Boy is cute, but it's hardly worth ordering the whole album to get it.  It's covered by many other artists,  e.g. Susan Egan.  Skip this, unless you are looking for music for a church gathering.+music
On a positive note ...+N+About the only good thing to be said about Boston is that they aren't Rush+music
Still love the movie ... still love the soundtrack+N+"Dirty Dancing" is still one of my favorite movies of all time.  It managed to have a plot and wonderful music.  You just can't sit still when this music is playing+music
Still Great+P+My first exposure to this recording was in a music course in college in the early 60s and I always remembered it fondly, especially the Elegy, which is one of the great melodic achievements in all of music. For  some reason, this never wound up in my library of vinyl and CD's, until now. The sound is incredible, easily on a par with many of today's recordings. But more impressive is the mastery of Fritz Reiner and the Chicago Symphony. It's called Concerto for Orchestra for a good reason, and the players deliver all the appropriate virtuosity. The taut, driving rhythm, Bartok's great contribution to 20th century music, moves the music forward naturally and inexorably. Great stuff and a great model for today's new generation of conductors and musicians+music
yeah, awful+N+What is this? His first album was great. I think this was trying to be too differnt and obscure. Like the beyond belief weird, " The omen,"( part 2 of damien) with Marilyn Manson.  Most of the music backrounds and not good and dont flow. Plus some of the rhymes dont make any sense, and are  just there for the sake of rhyming, " Ain't no way."  And as a second album it does it justice to being way more dirty and hardcore. Just the second track alone, " bring your whole crew," DMX speaks of raping a girl, killing someone  and then having sex with the corpse. I mean didnt you notice by the cover of DMX imersed in blood? I mean,  "slipping," is alright and, " It's all good," " Heat." As a whole, very un-enjoyable. I would be happy never  hearing this again. I mean inevative is great! But this mabye went too far, there weren't really any popular singles except for, " slippin'" A lot of people think DMX is a  god, and I remember DMX being a little bothered by that. A while ago the man was busted for inpersonating a police officer and pulling someone over. No to this+music
This could have been a great album+N+What is with the echo??? It is terrible. However, the music is great. It really upsets me. I saw them open for Pearl Jam and I thought the echo in the mic was a bad sound system, but when I listened to the album I realized he did this on purpose. Why? It could have been great+music
Yorke should not go Solo ever again+N+If you are expecting a sound from Thom Yorke as good as the band he fronts, you will be disappointed.  I do not believe this album is close to the quality of any Radiohead album.  T.Yorke is too experimental with his solo debut.  I am not impressed. "The Erasure" has glimpses of the brilliance of 'Kid A' and 'Amnesiac' but doesn't come close to matching either of Radiohead's most recent releases.+music
TOTAL HACK+N+I just can't understand who thinks this guy has any talent!  REALLY!  So many other funny guys...and this hack is the guy that is popular???!!  AVOID this CD...wasted my money+music
Look What The Cat Dragged In+P+With sixteen songs, the first impression is that there's got to be a lot of filler here.  The good news is there's nothing but perfect Rolling Stones songs - one after another.  The Stones jump around from the pondering bluesy, "Laugh, I Nearly Died" to the hard paced, "Driving Too fast" and "Rain Fall Down".  Some of the fun pops up with the blatantly political, "Sweet Neo Con" and the scathing, "Look What The Cat Dragged In".  It's all new, fresh and lively as hell.  Producer Don Was does a fantastic job getting the Stones to produce what is arguably their best album in over two decades.  Rock on+music
B Rich Iz Wack+N+Everytime &quot;Whoa Now&quot; comes on, I flip the channel.  B Rich is a disgrace to hip-hop.  I hope he won't be around for a while.  Look at the album cover, that's the worst I've seen.  Pack yo bags and B Poor+music
Bad Boys II is the best rap album this year!+P+"Bad Boys II" the soundtrack (Clean) is excellent and brilliant without compromise just like Martin Lawrence and Will Smith are. "Show Me Your Soul" From P. Diddy, Lenny Kravitz, Pharrell Williams, and Loon is superb. "La-La-La" From Jay-Z is excellent. "Shake Ya Tailfeather" From Nelly, P. Diddy, & Murphy Lee is dynamite. "Girl I'm A Bad Boy" From Fat Joe & P. Diddy Feat. Dre is brilliant. "Keep Giving Your Love To Me" From Beyonce is intriguing. "Realest N*ggas" From Notorious B.I.G. & 50 Cent is fanastic. "Flipside" From Freeway is excellent. "Gangsta Sh*t" From Snoop Dogg With Loon is brilliant. The rest of the tracks to the soundtrack I haven't listened to yet, but it could be as brilliant as the ones I just named off just now. Get this soundtrack now, I mean, now+music
ZZZZZzzzzzzz...+N+Oh my, what can I say about this whispery little train wreck.  It's third-rate coffee house music that struggles to be heard over conversations (as it should be).  In the quiet sanctuary of my den, it's revealed for all it isn't.  It isn't clever, musically or lyrically, and just drones along seemingly forever.  My audiophile friends would like it because the sparse notes and little extraneous noises would make their overly analytical and fatiguing systems sound magical.  Unless you're into performances that sound influenced by heavy doses of thorazine, don't bother+music
Two Great Songs+N+Mississippi and Sugar Baby are great songs, up there with the best Dylan has done. However, the rest of the album, while listenable, isn't all that memorable. Still, I suppose it's amazing that he can still produce a couple of great songs still, after over 40 years performing and recording. The same cannot be said for '60s peers like Paul McCartney or the Stones. Overall, Time Out of Mind was better, although that too was a little overrated, with only Not Dark Yet, Standing in the Doorway and Trying to Get to Heaven truly belonging to the canon of great Bob songs. +music
Better luck next album+N+This is an album just full of bubble-gum pop songs. If you actually hear music, don't buy this. And her little shrill in Go on and Cry is horrible.  Better luck next time. If there is a next time+music
Who is Best Rapper? T I   vs  LiL Flip+P+Who is Best Rapper?    TI?  vs  LiL Flip? Yesterday a young hiphop fan asked me who i thought is a better rapper between the two,  Hmm..From what i've heard  TI has the flow  and the subjects he speaks on its right here everyday in my life,  so without any question TI. Lil flip has juice wit me  but TI raps real talk i was raised in s'port LA. now its the dirty south and the youngsters of hiphop today come from every part of the world  so its nice to have a choice of TI or Lil Flip  verses whats not hiphop  but bares the name.  So to all of you old schoolers can let the young ones thought know whats real talk  whats real hiphop and whats not. Big ups to both artist,   BenJAMin MusiC       ReaLFunkY           ProducTionS +music
There's nothing in here!+N+After all the reviews I read, this has to be one of THE 'disappointing' albums I have picked up in the recent past. The music is dated, the lyrics are poor and the overall direction seems pointless. Where is Eric taking  his music? I have no idea. Drop it. There's tons of better talent out  there+music
I understand+P+I am 52 years old. I grew up (and still am growing up) listening to some of the finest rock n' roll ever produced.  Jet is the only new rock band I've understood in years. What does that tell you about the sorry state of music right now? Buy Jet's CD. Get their next one as well.  Listen to real rock n' roll.+music
The Bee Gees-Their Greatest Hits+P+Fabulous-This is a must have for any Bee Gee fans.  My 4 year old daughter even likes this music+music
Great album, but not MY favorite+P+I'm a huge fan of Edwin McCain, I've had all his albums at least twice (I end up losing them since I take them everywhere). This album is certainly not a disappointment. Many of the songs will strike an emotional chord in the deepest of us, others are just good fun to listen to. There is more rock and roll style songs on this than many fans will be used to, but they're all a blast to listen to. "Write Me A Song" and "I've Seen Love" are my favorites from this one. There are also a couple satirical songs - much like "Beautiful Life" from 'Messenger. Though 'Messenger' is still my favorite McCain album, I would never pass this one up. There is no reason why any Edwin McCain fan would not like this one+music
The Review of The Century.+N+I bought this album determined not to pay attention to any negative reviews from this site or any other. I have never been proven so wrong in my life. This album is inexcusably bad. Ths following review sums it up exactly.  21 of 36 people found the following review helpful:   Deplorable......!, September 20, 2005 Reviewer: Brendan "Bren" (New York) - See all my reviews  Whoever is the creative genius behind this miss matched MESS of a tribute should be fired immediately from whatever label or organization commissioned this album. Nostalgia aside, never have I heard such an amazing, talented group of performers (some of them amongst my favourites - Aretha Franklin, Beyonce, Stevie Wonder, Alicia Keys, John Legend, Patti LaBelle, Angie Stone) sound so unprepared, vocally dull, poorly produced and karaoke-like! Talk about the right singers singing the WRONG SONGS and then the wrong singers singing the RIGHT SONGS - who had the GALL to give 'Never too much' to MARY J. BLIGE??? And 'Superstar' to USHER???? USHER????? Of all the incredible R&B singers in existence, including the completely acceptable version by Ruben Studdard, you will give a classic like 'Superstar' to USHER??? Unreal. This whole project just sounds like/ reeks music biz politics to me....my baby Fantasia, Im sorry, this is the worst thing I have ever heard her sing and I think Fantasia is incredible. And what da *!@#!! is that bunch of musical MESSES in between - Celine Dion (mediocre)/ Donna Summer (a remix nightmare) Wyclef Jean (unspeakable) Beyonce & Stevie (boring, and I LOVE those two) Aretha Franklin (a la Divas Live solo - all over the place)/ Babyface (boring) Patti LaBelle (predictable) - oh my goodness. Too much. BARELY saving the album by sheer musicality and good singing - John Legend - truly an original sound - Angie Stone and JAMIE FOXX (would you believe?). Still - not the right songs to really make them shine. What a headache...  And perhaps the most absymal act of wanton disregard - WHERE WAS LUTHER'S FRIEND, BACKGROUND SINGER, PERFORMER EXTRAORDINAIRE AND CONFIDANTE ON THIS PROJECT - LISA FISCHER????? Abysmal I say again.  Suggestion - next Luther Vandross tribute - and Im sure there will be in a year or two - keep some of Luther's friends...but please take some TIME to match the right song with the right singer....and some NEW, INTERESTING voices please...do some research - there are people out there who are amazing, unrecognised or yet unknown talents that would complement any tribute....LEDISI, RACHELLE FERRELL, RAUL MIDON, MELONIE DANIELS, WILL DOWNING, LEELA JAMES, LIZZ WRIGHT and a couple of undiscovered underground R&B/ Jazz gems right here in New York, Abby Dobson, Cole Williams, R'kardo, Gordon Chambers, Lynn Lockamie, Ryan Shaw, Sasha Allen and the list goes on and on....singers who work tirelessly at their craft and consistently give great work...  I am appalled. May Luther rest in peace, and not turn in his grave at this slapdash atrocity that does not give any valid credence to the magnificent body of work this artiste of standard has left to the world - as his legacy.+music
What a beautiful, rich CD+P+I just stumbled on this CD by accident in a local music store, and what a wonderful find it was. Every song is a gem, the songwriting is one beautiful image after another, and the music has such depth in its sparse, seemingly simple way. Every listen just opens up more and more to me. I can't do the scholarly, professional music review, but I will say that this CD has sent me in a very short space of time to buy a copy of every other CD of his that I can find. My beginning acquaintance with those CDs just reinforces my feelings about The Animal Years. This is music that just calls you to sit, be still and enjoy watching in your mind a thing of beauty unfold. In a much too hectic world, it's a thing to treasure. Now I've just got to figure out how to make it to the coast to see one of his shows. +music

"Where do we go from here? There must be something near."+P+I'm going to review the 12 Judas Priest CDs from 1974-1990 except the two live CDs first. I am a huge Priest fan. I first got into Judas Priest 20 years ago and have stayed loyal to them ever since. This may limit my objectivity since these reviews will really be comparing the different CDs to one another not to other bands. There is no bad Judas Priest CD, only less consistent ones. Judas Priest is a band that have repeatedly experimented stylistically. Some of these experiments were more successful than others. There are CDs that are much heavier than others. I will try and bring all these factors into my reviews as well as attempting to summarize the general consensus among hardcore Priest fans about each individual release.  Judas Priest are possibly the most important act in metal history and they are certainly metal's most unwavering proponents. They helped invent heavy metal music, helped refine and perfect it, helped popularize it and have remained "defenders of the faith" during metal's darkest hours, while other "metal" acts ran for the hills. They are a legendary band whose role in popular music can not be overstated. If a metal band was not heavily influenced by Judas Priest directly, then they were heavily influenced by another band that was. Their reach is inescapable.  Judas Priest are led by Rob Halford, one of metal's most recognizable icons and possibly the greatest vocalist the genre has ever known. Halford's unearthly delivery and range are as responsible as anything else for Judas Priest's signature sound.  Judas Priest were not the first band to employ the services of two lead guitarists but they were certainly the first to fully implement them. Glenn Tipton and K.K. Downing are both phenomenal lead soloists but it's their riffs and songwriting that have made Judas Priest one of the greatest guitar bands of all time. Both are criminally underrated in the guitar world but Downing is even underrated among Priest fans.  Bassist Ian Hill rounds out the band. A founding member along with Downing, Hill is responsible for keeping the rhythm section humming along through Priest's many drummer changes. Hill is not a flashy player but is certainly competent and on the rare occasions the band's songwriting allows him to shine, he never disappoints.   If this is the worst CD Judas Priest ever recorded with the first Halford/Tipton/Downing/Hill (and it may be) then that's quite a compliment because this is a stellar debut.   Clearly, Judas Priest were still experimenting with their sound and trying to find their direction with this release. That being said, you can already hear the genesis of a fantastic songwriting collaboration which would make magic for the next three decades and counting. Tipton and Downing were already experimenting with integrating two guitars and their accompanying parts into a song.   "Rocka Rolla" is probably their least heavy CD. It is also like many other Judas Priest CDs in that it has it's own fairly unique sound in their catalogue. Overall, you will often find yourself asking whether this is truly a metal CD at all. In my opinion, this is the only Judas Priest CD that is true of. Some of the best tracks off their second CD, "Sad Wings of Destiny" were reportedly left off this CD and that, combined with the mediocre production quality, makes you wonder how truly great this could have been.  Track listing -   "One For The Road" - This slower-paced blues rocker starts off the album on a poor note. It certainly isn't a bad song. It's just a little uninspired and it probably is the worst song offered here. It almost certainly was a poor choice to lead off the album.  "Rocka Rolla" - Right off the bat, track 2 on their debut album, this is probably one of Judas Priest's all-time great songs. This is a fine, early example of a Judas Priest trademark, where each guitar and the bass are all playing their own riff. The magical combination of the galloping rhythm section, the sinister guitar lines and Halford's vocals really crystallizes here. There is perfectly placed harmonica at the close of the bridge section at the end of the guitar solo. This is a fantastic song, perhaps only slightly hampered by lukewarm lyrics.  "Winter - Deep Freeze - Winter Retreat" - I consider these three songs to actually be one continuous song and I consider "Cheater" to be seperate altogether. If nothing else, these songs are connected thematically while not being bound by musical motif. "Winter" starts things off well, immediately suggesting the chill of Autumn's demise with a grinding guitar sound effect and echoing, ethereal vocals by Halford. Pretty good. Fairly heavy. This part comprises the bulk of the trilogy, both being longest in duration and carrying the most emotional impact. "Deep Freeze" is Downing (not Tipton as another reviewer suggested) playing some tremolo lines through distorted sound effects. Downing himself has said he doesn't like this but I do. It does what it's supposed to, suggesting a chill so cold that words can't describe. It effectively makes the transition from "Winter" to "Winter Retreat". Even if you don't like it, it doesn't last too long. Admittedly, a LOT of people seem to dislike it. "Winter Retreat" is a very light, short song. Halford's voice is literally beautiful here and the lyrics suggest the time for optimism has arrived. Which of course is why it makes no real sense (possible irony?) to connect this with...  "Cheater" - Great blues-metal riff opens this song about revenge against a woman who has done our narrator wrong (and the guy she did it with too...). Perhaps the dark lyrical tone of this song would suggest to the observant the heavy musical days to come. A fantastic song overall with more strangely perfect harmonica work by Halford and highlighted by a fantastic guitar solo. I can't be sure but I believe the solo is Downing. Glenn would go on to play too many of the solos later in the band's career and this solo would appear to be evidence of that. Tipton seems to be a technically superior player and certainly tends to play faster solos, highlighted by a lot of pentatonics, hammer-ons, pull-offs, and finger tapping. Downing often plays a more soulful solo and he tends to use way more tremolo than Tipton. Of course, they're at their best when they trade off and play off of one another, highlighting each other's strengths.  "Never Satisfied" - Pretty good song featuring more phenomenal vocals by Halford, especially the final wail. Unfortunately, it's a weak spot, both because of the fairly lame lyrics and because the main riff, already used too repetitively, sounds too similar to the bridge. Al Atkins removal from the band seems to have benefitted Judas Priest in two ways. Halford sings circles around him and his removal as a lyricist had to have helped that area as well.  "Run of the Mill" - Clocking in at 8:33, one of Judas Priest's longest songs. One of their least metal. Also, definitely one of the most interesting lyrically of their entire career. The song deals with a person who has failed to reach their potential and has become a failure. This is a great song with some very soulful guitar work. Superlatives escape me to describe Halford's devastatingly poignant vocals. Listen closely to hear a great bass line hiding under all that guitar.  "Dying To Meet You" - Schizophrenic song that starts off with a rare bass intro from Ian Hill and a slower pace overall. The song tells the story of a soldier preparing for battle and then entering combat. Halford's vocal range is put to the test here as he sings the first part of the song about as low and deep as you'll ever hear him. About midway through the songs picks up speed, the guitars take center stage and Halford's vocal delivery gets much higher pitched. Lyrically, this is the part of the song where the fighting starts. The tone of the song seems a little derisive of the soldier himself, perhaps topically reflecting many people's attitudes about the Vietnam conflict, which of course was winding down at the time. Personally, I disagree with this view but Judas Priest are almost entirely an apolitical band for better or for worse so I can forgive these very trivial differences of opinion.  "Caviar And Meths" - A two minute instrumental closes the CD out. I think it's fantastic. Wordlessly sad. It's a tragedy that this was originally an eight minute long song with lyrics. I'd love to hear the full version but it's probably lost forever.  I don't consider "Diamonds And Rust", Priest's cover of the Joan Baez masterpiece a song from this CD. I consider it a part of "Sin After Sin", their third CD and will talk about it there. I believe the two versions of the song to be the same version with each being produced differently.  Amazon users consider this 10th out of 12 of Judas Priest's 1974-1990 CDs. I consider it dead last. That being said, it's still a great album. It's just not a great introduction to the band as a whole and a lot of fans of the heavier side of Priest may not like this album. Curious listeners should get "Screaming For Vengeance". It's not Priest's best but it's their best selling and possibly their most generally accessible and most indicative of what Priest generally sound like+music
Disappointing Given Jon Brion's Obvious Talent +N+It seems to me that Jon Brion has a split personality as a musician.  On one hand, he is an austere and formal composer in the classical sense (see his brilliant symphonic score for Magnolia).  And on the other hand, he is a pop magician, creating hooks within a Beatlesesque format as a producer and songwriter.  With Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Jon Brion taps into the latter musical personality, and given the context of a movie score, it feels ill-suited.  The scale of a movie score requires greater complexity in the composition than Brion's pop wizardry, as superlative as it is on albums by Rhett Miller, Aimee Mann, and the like, as well as on his own solo effort, Meaningless.  Most of the pieces on this soundtrack are mere shells of pop songs albeit with some winds and strings.  The difficulty and the sense of traditional musical history that informed the greatness of the Magnolia score is all but lost on this soundtrack.  As another reviewer commented, most of the pieces are extremely short, less than two minutes.  Jon Brion clearly has the brains.  So why not show it?+music

4.5 stars Weller's return to form+P+This first selfmade and coproduced solo album from the modfather was what the Style Council failed to do. In the same vein of much of what he recorded with his followup band after the jam- Weller ditched the cheesy synths and made a clean break with a more "earthy" soul sound and better production. Wellers voice also improved greatly from this point on. Songs like above the clouds- remember how we started- and bullrush all sound like council numbers in their style but they succeed on all levels- something the STC only managed a few times despite some great tunes. Into tomorrow sounds like what the Jam may have sounded like if they stayed together.(this is one of wellers best tunes still!) Part Curtis MAyfield-Marvin Gaye- with a heavy nod towards early Traffic- Paul weller rose from the ashes and became a force again. I cannot recommend this and Wildwood enough- both are essential for fans of any music- rock pop soul r+b mod. Other highlights include kosmos and Bitterness rising.+music

The lone dissenter+N+The Schumann that is presented here is a forgery. Don't get me wrong. I'm not railing against Schumann at all. The question here is what makes Schumann great, and the way that Bernstein presents these symphonies says Schumann is great for the wrong reasons. The real Schumann that lived was a completely different person than what we might assume from listening to this particular presentation of his music. Schumann was not a hopeless romantic. He was one composer in a long line of "classicists" which ended with Brahms, yet at the same time he was an innovator, pushing forward, trying to find new stylistic and technical means of expression. He had plenty of dignity, and he didn't write his music as a desperate plea for the world to like him, which is exactly what it sounds like here. Bernstein trudges through these fine works as if he were dying. Yes, many of these performances are the slowest on record, but this is a BAD thing. These beautiful works lose value immeasurably when they are saturated with thick, waxy, overly romantic textures and phrasing. Tell me, did Schumann ever write: "To be played extremely histrionically and melodramatically, with the greatest possible amount of cheese and theatrics" in his score? No! HE DID NOT. These performances are not more expressive than others in the real sense of the word, and any person in his/her right mind should be able to see this. You may be able to hear the orchestration more clearly than in Karajan's filth, but that's not saying much at all. And for this slight favor Bernstein does for the music, he makes it infinitely worse when he stretches the fabric of these works beyond their limit. The most blatant example is the third movement of the second symphony, taken at half tempo. All semblance of melody and motion is lost. This movement is supposed to be several minutes shorter than the first, and not the longest movement of the symphony, not to mention the longest movement in the entire set. In fact, almost every movement of every symphony could stand to have at least a minute hacked off of its timing. Also, while looking at the scores, you might notice that Bernstein does away with detail work this time around. Carefully laid out phrasing and the dynamic arch are thrown out of the window in favor of grand "romantic" gestures. Observing details in Schumann, ironically, helps to make the music speak more freely and honestly. This isn't honest music-making here, only a self-indulgent conductor once again plastering his image over the face of great art+music
Jazzy New Age+P+Excellent music for evening reading and study. In addition, it is also prefect for evening cuddling. Should not miss this collection+music
Basic and unmoving. Unoriginal.+N+With the caliber of musicians playing on this album, I expected a hard hitting original. Instead we get re-arranged covers and lots of "filler" salsa. No surprises here. The classic salsa albums are worth your cash but if you are curious, you'll play this one once+music
HE IS JUST LIKE O'REILLY..A PRODUCT HAWKER+N+Most radio shows will just play best of for free( btw Howard Stern invented the " BEST OF SHOW " ) ..to think he is selling it is very Bill O'Rielly.  Sellen crap to their audience taking advantage of their popular views to make a buck...vomit , puke+music
What a waste...+N+The songs in this CD were sang by thousand other singers million times. Unless if it's done differently with new arrangements, new style, better performance it's a total waste. My suggestion, please find new songs, there are plenty out there. Give the new writers a chance, pay them few dollars and give them some royalties. And you IL DIVO, will sound more unique and different. After all you have great voices+music
What! Ja WHO? Can't be!+N+This is not what I expected from such a gifted artist as Jaheim, did he change producers? The music and the man with the voice didn't go together well for me.  This is one I will not be purchasing, it is a serious down grade from his previous two albums. Better luck next time, Jaheim I was truly disappointed.+music
The man has guts...+P+If you don't care for the man's politics, that's fine. It is, after all, a free country. But the man has guts, as well as an ungodly talent for songwriting. No one is doing what he's doing been doing this long as well, and anything he releases is a gift to fans of sincere music. Peace+music
In my humble opinion -+N+Guys...it's not that GOOD. I have the album on my computer, and I gave it a few listens, but...it has no substance. It's not interesting or anything new. It's catchy. And irritating, after more than a song or two. That's all ("Bandages" is enjoyable once in a while, I will concede).   If you're looking for catchy and poppy (and there's nothing wrong with that), then buy it. If you want something new and original - don't. And if you want good indie dance/electronica-type music go for something like The Faint, The Bravery, or Le Tigre.+music
Children of Nuggets is minor league comp.+N+This sophomore collection holds no comparison to the more influential Nuggets collections-- Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the First Psychedelic Era, 1965-1968; or Nuggets II: Original Artyfacts from the British Empire and Beyond. Those two box sets highlighted some unknown and early punk and pop rock influences and proved as influential as Harry Smith's folk collection. Not so here. I counted about an 1/8th of the songs decent, but have to ask how often will you return to these novelties? Not much+music
Moron 5+N+This type of music is like a blister on the brain.  You can't get rid of it and it is irritating.  Yes, this is the problem with most FM radio when this CD from 4 years ago is still getting played.  And the tune to "This Love" is beyond annoying as he pauses between each word.  Moron 5 rank up there with Gwen Stefani and Black Eyes Peas for most annoying, successful artists+music
F for all accounts+N+This guy is hyped by DG to gain entracne into Chinese market. Either he does not know the reportoir, or he is faking.  I give minus five, that is -5, for listening experience and -100 for spending money. Stay away from this dude. DG is trying to make money of a bogus guy.  Sound is no good when playing by CSO under outgoing Barenboim is worthless+music
Bye, Bye Miss American Songbook+N+A long long time ago I can still remember how my sister Used to play his songs  And in the 80s changed his style Songs like Love Touch were so vile And Forever Young was on the charts too long  But this whole series makes me shiver With each new horror it delivers Bad and cheesy music It always makes me so sick  I can't remember if I spewed when I Heard him sing "It Had To Be You" But his integrity tore in two  The day the music died+music
First Band on the Moon  ~ The Cardigans+P+I was very uncertain what to expect from this band and after I had borrowed it from the library it lay on my desk for quite some time and then I was like, it can't hurt to listen to it, so I did. It is good, but not as good as I had expected. The females vocals are a bit weak and the lyrics are not their strong point. Then why do I give it four stars. Well, the sound, and vibe are great and one starts to think back on 60's pop and it is a blend of 60's pop and modern rock. The book-let is shoddy with terrible photographs that seem to have been shot by a 7 year old kid and what is up with that hair. It is called using a comb...? Even so, this is a good debut album that has some issues..+music
Simply great+P+One of the best albums from my favorite period in jazz history.  Put it in your collection+music
Not crazy about it.+N+Might just be me--but this is one of those CD's that the song they play on the radio is the only decent one. Maybe I'm too old for the rest--but wish I had kept the crystal so I could sell it on Ebay+music
Not an elitist, just enjoy good music - this mostly misses.+N+This album is, as has been mentioned before, a followup to Rice's O -- which in my estimation was an amazing CD that warranted listening to over and over again, adding to ipod playlists, creating CD's for my wife and just generally enjoying. Creative lyrics, although sometimes inscrutable (Blower's Daughter, one of my favorite songs, but what the heck is he talking about?!), made O never get old.  9 really misses the mark. It sounds like Damien has gone through some relationship issues that are still quite raw (affair, lack of passion, confusion, bitterness?) and although this sometimes makes for very interesting music in this case it is just too far inside the angst of Damien for me to relate to. Witness a sample of lyrics from the song 'Rootless Tree':  So **** you, **** you, **** you And all you didn't do I said leave it, leave it, leave it It's nothing to you And do you hate me, hate me, hate me, hate me so much That you can't let me out, let me out, let me out Of hell when you're around Let me out, let me out, let me out Hell when you're around Let me out, let me out, let me out  Ok then. Then there is 'Me, My Yoke and I':  My fall, my fall My fall gonna break ya My fall, my fall My fall gonna break your wall  I'm in, I'm in, I'm in Like a big dog I'm in, I'm in, I'm in Like a big dog yeah My god, my god, my god Gave me a rod My god, my god, my god Gave me a rod  For fishin, fishin, fishin Fishin, fishin, fishin yeah  Starting to get the idea? This is a self absorbed (more than usual) album that an angst filled "alone in my teenage bedroom" songwriter has written before but had the sense to not share with the world. Oh, and 'Sleep Don't Weep' ends with like 15 minutes of a Tibetan Bowl -- an annoying tone played continuously until it bores into your very skull. Was Rice just trying to see how much his listener's would put up with?  Having said all that, Lisa Hannigan shines once more in '9 Crimes' and Damien complements her very well, and you may find one or two more to strike your fancy, but overall I must say that the "emperor has no clothes" , even if others are afraid to say it+music
very talented work+P+hello there, i just want to say that the corrs DVD AUDIO has very great sound, i had the opportunity to listen to normal CD AUDIO but this is better, you could play it better on your own computer's dvd player as well, Corrs is the best band on planet, since i used to listen to them , february 2004, i couldn't stop hearing their tunes one to another, now they will be releasing their NEW ALBUM "HOME" AT OCTOBER 2005, which it's gonna be greatful! , oh i forgot,   G. Parsons "Ugh." , it's a pitty that you don't like the corrs as i do, but please don't try to humiliate them, i know you are a good human being as everybody, Corrs have their own prestige and it's not a subject of discutio+music
Rated 0 For Garbage!+N+Yayo needs to stick to being a criminal...but then again he wasn't even good at that+music
Their finest hour+P+Most people think that the heavily overrated Black album is Metallicas best CD. I completely disagree. This would be their best CD. Although this band was never as good as Megadeth or Slayer, this CD is still an epic in metal. This CD is their most technical release. The guitars are very complex, and while they cannot compete with the brutality of Slayer or the technicality of Megadeth, they are still complex, with lots of crushing riffs and wailing solos, as well as many melodic parts. You can't hear the bass very well, but the guitars more than make up for it. The drums are great. Too bad Metallica would follow up their best CD with their sellout album, then sink into the mainstream. This CD is awesome enough, but Rust In Peace is even better+music
Unique understanding of Brahm's first concerto+P+This version simply eclipses all the versions which I have previously listened to - and this is my favourite piano concerto ! Praise must also be given to Szell and LSO, for the orchestral part is the equal of the piano.  The remastered sound is a great success. Full marks +music
Delectable+P+Me oh my, what an outrageously good record this is. I had never heard of The Stone Roses until my brother played me &quot;I Wanna Be Adored&quot; a few years ago. I loved the song, but I thought they would be a band very much like The Smiths or The Cure (which isn't a bad thing at all, I just wasn't interested at the time), so I never followed up and bought any of their albums. Thankfully, my father received this cd from my brother for his birthday a few months ago, and I've had the pleasure of listening to it everyday since then. All of these songs exude an indomitable vitality that lends an extra cachet to the already stellar music. There is a distinctive 80s sounds to The Roses, but after listening to all the material present on The Very Best Of, it's apparent that these songs transcend their era and will always remain as timelessly great pop confections. Highlights of this recording include the ebullient &quot;What the World is Waiting For&quot;, the dreadfully pleasing &quot;I Wanna Be Adored&quot;, and the anthemic numbers &quot;Made of Stone&quot; and &quot;I am the Resurrection&quot;. I highly recommend this to all+music
Tony Bennett...er, Eric Clapton+N+I only hope this doesn't signify the end of his career. Any time an artist begins consistently collaborating with "friends", it signals the end of a career. Look at Santana. The guy can't make a solo album anymore. This is what happened to John Lee Hooker. Musically, this albums lacks the care Clapton used to give his music. He used to be a careful, calculated musician who knew how to rock. Just bear this in mind if you buy the album. You may want to enjoy this CD with a 6-pack of ensure while wearing your favorite pair of Depends. And a members only jacket. Clapton just doesn't know what he wants on this album. Blues? Jazz? Easy Listening? Ho-Down Appalachian Stomp? Hee Haw? Crooner?   Eric, make up your mind. Then give us a cd worth a listen+music
Nobody likes a show off..+N+...particularly one who falsely refers to himself as a prince and who produces trash like this. When Doves Cry is an unashamed rip off of MC Hammer's excellent Pray and the title track is far too long for my liking. Save your money. +music
Neutral Milk Hotel Ripoff+N+I get the feeling that most of the reviews on here for this album are written by folks who feel special because they think they discovered some new amazing genre and sound that no one else knows about.  Hate to break it to you kids, but this sounds has been around since the mid 90s.  It was called Neutral Milk Hotel and it was vastly superior to these con-artists called the Decemberists.  Before you disagree with me, go pick up Neutral Milk hotel's In the Aeroplane over the Sea (1997), and then try to disagree+music

2 and a half stars+N+"Howl" comes so close to being good. They capture a real authentic "backporch" sound, with great production. The lyrics are passable, the singing isn't too obnoxiously affected. But there just aren't any good songs on here.   It's like when you meet someone who dresses well, seems to share some common interests, and can make small talk like a champ. But then when you finally try to have a substantial conversation you realize they are thoroughly uninteresting, and just sort of suck all around. Well, it's the musical equivalent of that.  They set a great vibe for beer drinking, sitting on the porch, etc. Just like a tape of whales calling to each other really gives you that authentic ocean feel. But nice as they sound, whales don't write good music and niether do the Black Rebel Motorcycle Club.  Alot of people see music's primary function as providing a nice background. I'm sure they'll be pretty happy with this cd. Also, a lot of people are lifeless zombies with no souls.  +music
Wrong CD+N+I had ordered this CD for my husband.He likes the movie "The Longest Yard" and he wanted to get the soundtrack of the movie. Unfortunately at the time of ordering it did not specify what songs were included in the CD, but I thought if it was from The Longest Yard movie, then it would be the soundtrack.Well, I received the package and gave it to my husband for him to open, he started playing it and was very disappointed.He ended up getting a CD full of stupid rap songs. I am not happy with what I received, if I could send it back and get something else I would,but I know it will be a hassle to even ask for an exchange.My suggestion to other people is to find out exactly what they're lookin for before placing an order and just because the cover looks like the original,it does not mean it's what you're really looking for. I only spent $12.00 which is a good thing, but it could have lost a lot more. Thank you+music
Not So Immaculate+N+Madonna's best was during the early and mid-80's.  This album proved that she jumped the shark by 1987 and has been famous for who she is ever since. +music
Mediocre Rapper Takes Over The World!+N+First off, Kanye West is about as mediocre a rapper as it comes.  He looks plain, sounds plain, and if it wasn't for the controversy that surrounds him, everyone would be like "Who Cares?"  But while he sings about Jesus and lives like he is a prophet, there is no substance to him and his music.  Lame beats, hypocritical lyrics, this is the core of what is wrong in secular music today.  His interviews show him as arrogant, racist, and unlovable, but it is selling his music and that's what he cares about.  So while his rapping voice is mediocre and his rhymes are abysmal and his life is lukewarm, he is sure to sell records galore and people will adore his hypocrisy (and their own hypocrisy).  So let's be real for a second, because I am about to give you the best CD you will hear in years - it's a mixture of rap and rock, with (real!) beats, acoustic guitar, splashes of piano, and a voice that can sound like Chris Martin of Coldplay one second and then rap like LL Cool J the next...buy today Mat Kearney's "Nothing Left To Lose."  The best CD of 2006 and without an ounce of hyprocrisy while being true to himself+music
Thanks, but no thanks.+N+Most people considered this the Cheap Trick &quot;comeback&quot; album.  Sixteen years after the fact I'm forced to admit that it ranks as more of a &quot;go-back&quot; album instead.  While Cheap Trick didn't set the music world on fire with most of their 80's releases, it wasn't until the rot set in on the unbelievably sub-par release &quot;The Doctor&quot; that I actively had to search for something good to say about one of their albums.  On &quot;The Doctor&quot; I searched but came up empty.  &quot;Lap Of Luxury&quot; isn't quite that bad, but it set a bad tone for the releases to follow.  I've made dozens of Cheap Trick compilations over the years and &quot;Let Go&quot; was the only song that I included off of LOL.  The thing that consistently irritated me with each subsequent release in the 80's and early 90's was the press release that was issued saying how this was the album that took the Trick back to their rockin' roots.  Well let me tell ya, this is far from it.  I know.  I remember+music
Tres belle+P+I don't speak a word of French beyond tourist phrase-book niceties. I discovered this album when I was an undergraduate, in the Undergrad listening library at the University of Washington (Seattle). I love the sound. Still do.

Every George Strait fan, and collector, will want to include this truly outstanding boxed CD set in their collection!   Five Stars!+music
It's a Beautiful Day+P+I'm a U2 diehard fan from Chile, and i love their music. The new 2 songs are excelent. This compilation incorpores a beautiful booklet with details of the chart position when each single was launch in USA and UK. U2 has an important place in my life - and i wonder what a lot of people in the world think and feel the same -, so we must celebrate, and wait until the new record is edited - and the begining of the new tour -. If you love U2, you must have this cd.+music
The Purple Genius+P+Three hours of perfect Prince is hard to believe.  Here it is.  All the grooves are present.  All the funk.  The indulgent boudoir ballads.  The ambiguous spirituality. Cameos of soul & gospel & rap. If you've ever liked any Prince song, then you're bound to find another favourite on this explosion of creativity. * Of course there's a reason this album is so overwhelming, both in terms of quantity and quality: it represents the best of five years of songwriting.  Allegedly in 1991 or so Prince walked into the Warner Bros. offices and dumped five albums' worth of music into their laps, thus fulfilling his 'contractual obligations' for the next five years.  He then went home and continued to write songs.  Once 'emancipated' from WB, free to form NPG music, he released this treasure trove.  Without normal distribution, however, it "only" reached No.11 on the Billboard Album Chart, and spawned only one single.  Crazy stuff.  There's enough musical genius here for three or four chart-topping albums and a host of singles. * There are DVDs available of Prince's more recent lives shows, featuring consumate musicians, such as Maceo Parker and members of The Family Stone, but none more distinguished than Prince himself - his performances are terrific and showcase his enormous talent.  Music is his life.  He can play virtually any instrument, sing, write, arrange...dance.  What's more, he enjoys himself on stage - and it's hard not to share in it all.  The DVDs are ideal complements to this CD set. * I think this is one of his best ever albums, and one of the best pop albums of all time.  Having heard almost all his work, this would be my desert island recording.  I've wondered why the praise for it has been less than universal and concluded that in a strange sense it is "too good" - there are at least twenty songs that could have been Top 10 hits, and which beg to be treated as 'favourites' - normally, I'd listen to an album and come back to 2 or 3 songs repeatedly - here, that makes for a difficult choice - what's more, since these songs have been starved of airplay they don't bring that welcome nostalgia of a popular hit, no memory of dancing to this or that at a party - it's almost like listening to a great new song for the first time.  Also, there's no filler, nor is there a "theme" which allows for half-attentive listening - every four minutes another great tune shouts out and demands to be heard!  It's so good that it's almost hard work! +music
A Poor Man's Michael Jackson Meets R.kelly+N+Prince is Talented,though I can't remember when I last heard it because he has dropped plenty of wack Music for a really,really long time.in hindsight He is basically a Musical Version of Puffy.meaning while Prince can play,He ain't never done anything remotely Original.He was in the late 70's through the 80's a Poor Man's Michael Jackson.then fast forward to the 90's on this long-winded Album he was trying to Jack R.kelly's style.interesting irony is that Michael Jackson&R.kelly could do Prince's whole thing in there sleep,but when he tired to Emulate them He comes across even more Corny than He already is.He will touch the King of Pop MJ&the King of R&B R.Kelly so maybe in the future Prince will find some Originality??I doubt it.He just bites off everyone.wasted Talent+music
Two Star Average...Hahaha+N+Let's face it. Rap/hip-hop basically killed itself during the turn of the century. With no talent retards like 50 Cent, Ja Rule, Nelly, Ludacris, Lil Jon, D4L, and a million others dumbing it down with processed fake lyrics and repetitive beats that drive real music fans crazy. It's horrid, I tell you. With a bunch of guest appearances by other mainstream hacks and horrible vocabulary, no wonder the society has gone corrupt. Hopefully this hack will stop rolling around in the money and get a job at the local gas station.  If you want good rap, go for N.W.A., Wu-Tang Clan, Public Enemy, and anything the members in those bands have done. For talented music in general, go for Between The Buried and Me, Unearth, Chimaira, Necrophagist, Dying Fetus, Aborted, The Black Dahlia Murder, Despised Icon, Darkest Hour, Meshuggah, Cryptopsy, basically anything that I give good reviews on.+music
P.O.Esssss.+N+Nice going puto you set my buddy and his race back 200 years during your 15 minutes of fame+music
Daring Divine Delbert+P+A fan of Mr. D's for many years and appreciating his uniqueness and sense of humor always shown in his music.  Track #8 Down in Mexico is a song not to be missed with anyone with ears muchless a fan.  Saw Delbert perform it live on 2/14/06 in Lex KY the best sound I've ever heard in concert; any genre. This CD offers subtle surprises and big smiles.  Pashaswife  +music
Copies Amazed power-ballad success way too much+N+Lonestar didn't really surprise me with their 2001 effort.  I'm Already There and Not A Day Goes By suffers from "Amazed" syndrome.  Amazed's 1999 multi-format mega success is spread all over this album, their wanting to sound like every '80s heavy metal band power ballad.  Did they listen to Monster Ballads 2 too much while making this album in Nashville? I'm Already There comes off as very Diane Warren-ish in its sappy lyrics.  Their wanting to be diverse as a country band is okay, but these songs don't work for them.  These songs are just complete fluff and their other songs are far better than this. +music
cd+P+The cd arrived in good condition and i got it within a couple of days+music
Love, Love, Love "The Nightfly".+P+My first introduction to Donald Fagen, was his "New Frontier" video on MTV, which was in heavy rotation in 1983.  Brillant video that accurately protrayed the story related in a great song.  (A special thanks to all the people who have posted the "New Frontier" video on You Tube.)  I loved the song and the video.  Years later with "New Frontier" stuck in my head on a constant mental replay track, I bought "The Nightfly", and was amazed by how brillant the album was.  The first shock was hearing "I.G.Y-International Geophysical Year", which I still hear on the radio, but never knew it was Donald Fagen.  This is the first song on the album, followed by more wonderful songs.  It's a concept album, with the theme of the Atomic Age/New Frontier movement of the late 1950's and early 1960's.  It captures both the optimism of new technology leading the way, with the underlying hint of fear, that some of this Atomic Age technology might be the end of the world.  The pop culture references in some of the songs are wonderful, as they help convey the feeling of that time.  The song "New Frontier" has several references-actress Tuesday Weld from "The Many Lives of Dolby Gillis" and Jazz great Brubeck are mentioned in it.  As far as concept albums go, I would put this up there with Pink Floyds "The Wall" or "Dark Side of the Moon".  It is much closer to "Dark Side" musically.       The best thing about "The Nightfly" is it's mellow, with catchy hooks and grooving rhythms.  It's great to listen both actively to hear the stories convenved in the songs, but also works if you just want nice background music.  Some of songs are also fun for dancing too. I can listen to this entire album from start to finish, happy with every song on it.  It's a rare for an artist to be able to put out an album like that.  I'd love to see the videos made for this album released on DVD+music
Wots, Uh, The Deal?+N+Amazon's review for this is ridiculous; "zeppelin's one true disappointing album" (what about hourses of the holy, precense, in through the out door hmm?) "there is some classic material here"?!?! I have no idea what they're talking about. This is the worst "odds and sods" album ever released. Its truly insane to listen to this, and think this is what the band thought was good stuff to release from the vaults. It shows Page's poor mental state at the time; he seems to have truly lost it due to heroin.   Or maybe this is all the stuff that was in the vaults? That seems unlikely, but perhaps that's the only way to explain this. Did they really release everything they recorded? The mind boggles! Nobody does that; you don't record 12 songs for a 12 song album, you record 30, 35 and whittle it down to the best songs. If Zeppelin truly just recorded and released everything they wrote, that would be amazing. It would be unlike any other band ever.  Sorry I dwell so long on that. It's just I do not want to talk about "the music" on this album. Its so incompatiable with Zeppelin's legacy, and it is truly a complete embarasment to the band, or it should be. This stuff doesn't even qualify for THE FIRM for Gods sake! As cynical as I am about Led Zeppelin, they could really get me rocking at their best; they were majestic, mythical, AND rocking, all at the same time! They were a good band with good music, that always at least had interesting sounding material. This stuff wouldn't have made the grade on the sex pistols album; its that bad.  Don't buy this; even if you're vaguely interested, don't buy this. If you like Zeppelin, you won't after this! Or maybe you'll just be a drone and use words like "lost classic." If you do, you are a goofy SOB+music
A truly excellent musical+P+It is a shame to learn that Kopit and Yeston purchased the rights to the Pantom of the Opera but were usurped by Andrew Lloyd Webber as it was in the public domain in Enland. Otherwise, we would have this marvelous music to listen to as much as we now listen to Webber's work. In a way we are fortunate that Webber's work can be heard as well as Yeston's work as the latter was allowed to publish in the US. Still, it is sad to realize that the public mainly ignores this work as they think first, that it even exists and second, that it is inferior to the Webber's work. The fact is that Phantom is excellent in its own right and has great songs such as "Home", "Melodie de Paris" and "Who Could Have Dreamed Up You". I highly recommend it to anyone. +music
The Sound of One Band Aging+N+I have been so underwhelmed by this tepid album since it came out, but I thought I'd give it a little time to do a little aural sneak-attack and start to "grow on me". No such luck. This release is so thoroughly forgettable that after the few times I've listened to it, paying strict attention and trying hard to feel something ( in a feeble attempt to assuage my self-inflicted guilt for shelling out hard-earned dough for this...ummm....music), I can't say I remember a single passage or sentence from this bland offering.   And what I'm comparing it to is the sheer brilliance of previous recordings, emotionally supercharged songs like  " Carry the Zero" or "Kicked it in the Sun" that really affected me profoundly the first coupla times I heard them and have stuck with me for years. All I can sense here is the grayness of a group of musicians who don't even really have the energy (or sense) to coast on the punch their early outings conjured up so deftly. Even the obligatory Neil Young ( a true creaky old dude if their ever was one) noodling is so embarrassingly derivative and uninspired you just wanna pat these guys on their sweatered backs and guide them to a comfy chair.   I'm giving this one a one star not in comparison with other bands but compared to what Built to Spill used to be capable of. Maybe it's the fame, maybe it's the fortune, but this is a band that has truly lost its teeth. Pray god they score some dentures before they muster the energy to inflict more sonic gummings on their hapless fanbase.....      +music
Stop The Madness!+N+It is hard to imagine what the American songbook ever did to Rod Stewart that he would decide to degrade it like this, not once, not twice, but three times.  Stewart's decision to approach these shop-worn standards ranks up there with Napoleon's decision to invade Russia during the winter, it is staggeringly ill conceived.  The problem, of course, is his voice.  The selection of material seems ideally suited to showcase his limitations as a singer, which are countless.  For starters, he has almost no range at all.  Next, his raspiness has no inherent beauty, and these are songs intended for beautiful voices.  By their very nature, the selections are vehicles for skilled singers, their simplicity allows excellent performers to interpret and express individual perspective.  Stewart, because he is a rock and blues singer, never learned the fundamentals of singing and certainly never developed a mature, expressive voice.  He scratches along the surface of these listless vehicles with the charm of a man skating over ice with sandpaper strapped to his shoes.  Banks of strings and fabulously misguided collaborations, (Dolly Parton!), do not mask but highlight what is wrong with this project.  Bear in mind that I like Rod Stewart; he's from Scotland and he's the prototypical Brit blues belter.  If you want to know what he's actually good at, dig out your copy of Jeff Beck's first release, Truth.  Stewart delivers some of the best blue-eyed twelve bar wailing ever recorded.  But that's the problem.  On Truth it was the cigarettes, whisky, and swagger in his voice that made him great - it wasn't about singing technique - it was about authenticity.  Here, the focus is on singing, and his limitations are embarrassingly spotlighted.  Albums like this never get made unless the performer already has name recognition that guarantees sales, nightmares of this stripe could never stand on their own merits.  To be avoided at all cost. +music
You just can't stop dancing+P+When I listen to this CD, I and my friends are instantly tempted to dance. This is a fine CD to have+music
Could have been so much better+N+What a shame that gems such as Longfellow Serenade, Signs, Lady-Oh and Both Sides Now were left off this release in exchange for several low quality live recordings that DO appear.   Given Mr. Diamond's long and illustrious career, this release disappoints. Again, what a shame. So much potential and so little fulfillment+music
Keep 'em Coming+P+Another good CD from Jimmy! Need to keep the studio CD's coming and not take so long between. This CD has a great mixture of vocals from several country stars and some good tunes with Buffett solo. Trip Around The Sun with Martina is great+music
Saw it and loved it+P+Maybe you need to see it in the context of the show. I loved the show and the cast recording. To each his own+music
it dont get no better+P+I have to agree with an earlier review-this is a true desert island disc.my favorite jj album.sultry guitar and terrific songs.this is an underrated masterpiece.&quot;cherry&quot; would make the price worth it.&quot;i'm a gypsy man&quot;&quot;let me do it to you&quot;not a wasted note on the whole thing.dont miss it+music
beautiful...makes me think of the film!+P+This is a wonderful album that is filled with color and life (not unlike the movie).  We have a great cross-section of sounds represented here.  "Rose de Castilla," a beautiful, all-vocal song, takes us back to Michoacan, where the Sanchez Family gets their start, before the father, Jose, walks across the border to Los Angeles ("a line in the dirt in those days").  We also hear the energetic music of the 1950s ("Angel Baby" by Jeanette Hurado and "Que Rico El Mambo" by Perez Prado).  This transports us to the lives of the first generation of Sanchezes, born in the United States, raised by their Mexican-born parents.  We also have some lively merengue (in the form of "Guavaberry" by Juan Luis Guerra y 4.40).   You all will love this CD!!! +music
Wow, that was dreamy.+P+I am one of the few who believe that "Isn't Anything" is leagues better than "Loveless". This is one of my favorite albums; therefore, it's one of the few albums I've actually purchased. "Isn't Anything" isn't really one of the most uplifting albums of all time, but it is undoubtedly original and I might even add, influencial.   The lyrics are beautiful and heartfelt, the vocals are what really makes the album so dreamy. Kevin Shield's voice is like a blur, and I don't even know what a blur sounds like.   "No More Sorry" is what really made the album for me, personally, it just flows very well. This isn't really an album you'd want to just listen to the drumsticks hit the drums and the pics hit the guitar, no, you should concentrate very hard on the lyrics. Maybe, you'll even pick up the messege 'My Bloody Valentine' are trying to send across. Of course though, that's a different messege for everyone+music
A great and beautiful musical!+P+I very very highly recommend this musical. It is such a sweet love story, with wonderful songs. Sadly not many people know about the musical "Carnival," based on the film, "Lili." It is definitly a gem.  The song that especially touched me, was the hauntingly beautiful, "Her Face."  It's such a romantic musical with unforgetable cute songs and romantic ones as well+music
Dylan's Second Album Masterpiece+P+After careful consideration this was the Dylan album I chose to buy.  And I do not regret buying it nor should anyone.  This is a masterpiece.  Not many people can make an album that holds you from track 1 to the end.  The Beatles, Tom Petty, and Bob Dylan all can keep you sittin' on the edge of your seat.  Great timeless songs on here are of course Blowin' In the Wind a song that breaks generation barriers.  The lovely Girl From North Country, Bob Dylans Bob Dylan's Blues, Masters of War, and many more.  Without a doubt a must have in any Dylan collection.  Your not a Dylan fan if you don't have this+music
A Big Disappointment+N+I expected alot more from the CD!  I expected more or what Creedance Clearwater Revival WAS....The songs on the CD weren't the best & the quality of the CD was only average.This is not worth the time or the money! And I'm a BIG FAN of 60's Rock!!  Try Buffalo Springfield, or Crosby, Still, Nash & Young or Janis Joplin with Big Brother & the Holding Co. And the old Stand By's:  Beatles & Stones!! Long Live Rock & Roll!+music
Great album to listen to together!+P+My five-year-old daughter and I really love this CD.  The covers are great "versions" of the originals, and the original tracks are great additions to the overall feel of this CD.  Maroon 5's "Pure Imagination" is fantastic, as is The Dixie Chick's "The Rainbow Connection." It's a great CD to listen to together and it doesn't drive you crazy after the fifth time because it's kinda "rockin'".  If your children are strictly into "kiddie" types of music, i.e. Laurie Berkner, this probably isn't going to be their thing.  My daughter is older and is, thankfully, expanding her musical tastes.  This is something we both enjoy, minus the singing veggies and all...I highly recommend this to more mature children+music
Rebirth, eh?  That's both pretentious and funny.+N+When used in the music industry, the term rebirth would indicate erasing the slate and starting anew, and presenting yourself as something different.  Perhaps Jennifer Lopez thought of this knowing that her singing career was in decline, and opted to give her fourth album the title Rebirth.  Is there any legitimate sign of a rebirth on this album, you ask?   A few songs in, and the answer is clearly no.  The songs are still built on synthetic arrangements with synths and samples where real instruments could be, the lyrics are still some of the most shallow you'll ever hear, Lopez still isn't doing much in the way of writing, and her thin voice still sounds the same way it did on her first album.  You would think by now that with all the time that Lopez has spent as a recording artist that some aspects of her output would have improved, but that is not the case.  If the Lopez faithful (who made her first two albums multi-platinum hits) need any proof how weak her voice is, listen to some of the songs here, including the single "Get Right" - she TALKS her way through a lot of these tracks.  That's right, not singing or rapping, but talking.  You have to hear them to know what I mean.  Did you ever stop to think that she doesn't perform live because she can't sing a note in tune?  One thing I'll give her credit for is that at least she isn't taking advantage of her fans by performing "live" concerts while miming the whole thing (like those hacks Britney Spears and Hilary Duff).  The material is so weak that it's little wonder why her fan base has eroded as of late, despite her high profile.  In summary: Not being true to its title, Rebirth is instead a continuation of the weak bubblegum pop and lite R&B sounds that we've come to expect from Jennifer Lopez.  In short, expect more studio-enhanced singing, more synthetic music and more lyrics so weak that even Black Eyed Peas would have rejected them.  You can definitely do better than this album - just don't expect to hear it on the "hit music" station+music
Baaa baaa, music for sheep (0 stars)+N+Emo noisemaking and Christian themes. The two worst elements of our society combined in a package filled with talentless musicianship. Face it kids this is a fad. A really pathetic fad. Disco was a fad and they has thousands upon thousands of drones listening and participating in the Disco scene. The same happened with Hair Metal and Nu-Metal. Those scenes are completely dead and gone and so will this one be one day. You will look back on this period of your life tied up in this fad in embarrasment of your blatant stupidity. As I always say in my reviews, this is trash and should be treated so accordingly. This band should take their Emo wrist cutting lyrics to heart and kill themselves for the better of humanity.+music
???????+N+I havent listened to these guys since vaseline way back in the early 90's........after reading rave reviews about this album, here on amazon, i had to see what the fuss was about...  The first couple of tracks are ok.....especially the first one, that is the best song off the album....as i got further down the trackilisting, they start to all sound the same....  how about the singer, if my memory is correct, he is that crazy looking clown like idiot with huge red puffy hair.....  i think his voice is so stupid, its not even funny.....oh and the lyrics, come on now.....they are ABSOLUTELY ridiculous  If you consider yourself as one of those worm type little people, that rootes for guys like roger from the nerds.....this is your type of music...+music
Thunderstorms+N+Very dissapointing. Too many wildlife creature noises. If I had wanted to hear birds singing in the rain and other animal noises I would have looked for a title that matched my request. I wanted to hear rain and thunder only.+music
One of my favorite kid's albums so far...+P+What a fun album! My 18 month old boogies like crazy to these tunes -- and they are varied enough and laced with some grown up humor that I don't want to run from the room hearing it over and over. It doesn't have thay syrupy sweet sound found in so many kids' albums. Try it - you won't regret it+music
Tiesto changed+P+I honestly dont understand why does every artist in Electronic Music trying to change so much.  Take for example Ferry Corsten... what happened to his beautiful tear-jerking tunes back when Right of Way was in.  If you ever saw him, you'd know how incredibly tallented he is.  Now he, as many others, have jumped on teh POP based train.  Tiesto, definitely puts a nice show on with his epic trance set presented on this cd.... however, like many say, I really miss his 2003 2004 days... if you ever heard a live set from those days, definitely his 2 DVD-s... now that is quality.  As far as sound production, mad props to the sound engineers... by far it is the clearest highest quality sounding cd i have ever heard.  Song selection wise, hmmm as always, i could pick better, but I guess everyone has a different style, in what they like.  I still stand by saying, GO SEE THE MAN LIVE! +music
The Album You Buy For A First Timer+P+Have that friend who likes good music but doesnt know Cocteau Twins?   Give em this one and watch the obsession fly+music
Avoid the CD!+N+OK, I figure if you're looking at this CD, you're a Laurie Anderson fan and can recall at least twice you've seen her great concert movie, likely at a midnight showing back in the 80's.  Well, if you're that person, avoid the utter heartbreak which is this CD.  I counted 18 tracks from my old VHS copy of this concert, while only 8 made it to the CD.  The banter between tracks is omitted entirely.  The tracks are out of order (OK, small nitpick), and it's certainly not worth the effort.  I'm sorry, Laurie, but Warner scr-wed you hard on this one.  On the up side, the sound quality is good, certainly better than my VHS.  But hey, this is a concert film soundtrack, but apparently they forgot to include the second disk.  Laurie fans will be livid.  (Others merely confused!  :+music
Powerful and passionate....+P+A lot of people really freaked out when Dylan became a born again Christian.  I remember reading that he appeared on Saturday Night Live in 1979 right around the time this album got released, and that the cast and staff were terrified of his Christianity.  I find their paranoia silly.  Much of Dylan's work dealt with God and religious & spiritual issues anyway, here it was just made more explicit.  This is one of Dylan's best albums.  His voice is filled with passion, and these songs are excellent.  All of these songs still hold true today.  Slow Train, Gotta Serve Somebody, Precious Angel, and When You Gonna Wake Up? are my favorites here.  There isn't one wasted song on the whole album.  Even if you're not religious, you can listen to this.  This is a great spiritual record.  It isn't overly preachy, and it isn't sanctimonious.  It's just really sincere, like all great art.  Dylan rules... +music
Kasabian has run out of ideas+N+I like several songs on Kasabian's old album but there were also many poor ones. Still on this album I dont know if i could say that there are any songs better than Club Foot, Reason Is Treason, and Processed Beats.  It seems Kasabian has gone psychedelic and also run out of ideas in the process, there is nothing special or creative on this album+music
The Continued Evolution of a Genius+P+Anyone who talks about &quot;fading genius&quot; in reference to this album is out of their mind. It is true that by the time Sly released &quot;Heard ya missed me...&quot; the band had hit the nadir of its creative output, but their downward slope did not start until well after this album was recorded.     &quot;Small Talk&quot; is in fact a brilliant follow up to Fresh, and a brilliant acheivement in it own right. The album retains the positive lyrical content, but it redirects that positivity toward more personal and family oriented themes. The arrangements are less in your face, the feel is a lot more relaxed, and there is even a lot of (absolutely wonderful) studio chatter to preface certain songs.    Sly could never release two similar albums in a row, so for this album he broke with protocol in another senese that a lot of these reviewers don't get: &quot;Small Talk&quot; is a SOUL album. Here is why: The grooves are subtler and more sedate, violins are involved (but not in a cheesy way), and there is a new emphasis on gutwrenching, heartfelt vocals. Indeed, both Sly and Rosie turn in their best vocal performances here.     I think many of the people who have reviewed &quot;Small Talk&quot; here on Amazon have missed this point entirely, but you might miss it as well. So, if you're looking another agressive funk album the likes of Riot or Fresh, you will also be severely dissapointed by &quot;Small Talk&quot; and should not buy it.    However, if you like albums like Donnie Hathaway's &quot;Everything is Everything,&quot; or if you Cymande's downtempo stuff, or Charles Wright and the 103st Rythym Band, then spare no expense and immediately purchase this Japanese import. This is one of the best SOUL albums ever recorded (which is not to say it's not funky.)    If you bought &quot;The Essential Sly and the Family Stone&quot; like I did, you've already heard Time For Livin' and Loose Booty. Like me, you probably thought they were solid tracks but would not persuade you to buy a 30 dollar CD. Well, after hearing Small Talk in its entirety I can honestly say that those are the two WEAKEST tracks on here.    Sly was a genius and this album chronicles his continued evolution. It is a must have for anyone who likes Sly, soul, funk, or even just music. The fact that this Small Talk is not available in America is a profound statement about the way our nation treats its visionaries and cultural giants+music
Do Yourself a Favor...+N+Buy a Weezer album instead. I don't really get the comparison to the Beach Boys, but the lead singer of this band does a pretty decent Rivers Cuomo imitation.+music
IT SNIKES+N+THIS IS THE WORST SONG I LISTED TO IN MY LIFE  IT SOUND LIKE A BANRE+music
Lame,  and not original.....+N+Never seen the band live but this CD is a big disappointment. The sound is a low budget version of Santana / Los Lonely Boys. The songs are lame and way too commercial.  Hope their next album turns out to be better (a lot)+music
I dont like crunk+N+This is certainly the worst of it. At least Lil Jon has good beats and stuff. This has none of that, and it is just annoying. Support better artists+music
this is a very  good C.W. album but not the best+P+This is one of the better albums of C.W.McCall's tunes. I've been looking for years for a copy of the Wolf Creek Pass album. I have it on a worn out 8-track and can't seem to locate it anywhere else. With songs like Nite Rider, Old Sloan,Classified, 4-Wheel Drive, Old Thirty and more. This one will serve as a substitute till I can find one+music
Not worth the money; not worth the time+N+When I was vacationing in London this past May I spotted this new Morcheeba CD at the store.  I bought it and couldn't wait to get it in the CD player.  Having only discovered this group a couple of years ago with the "Parts of the Process" compilation, I had fallen in love with the easy grooves and Skye Edwards talented, sultry voice.  (Listen to "The Sea" and then follow it up with "Undress Me Now" and you'll understand the magic in the range of her voice.)  Imagine my extreme disappointment when I heard "The Antidote."  Skye is gone, replaced my a singer with a lower register and very little range.  At times the new singer's voice grated on my nerves so much, I had to move to the next track.    The CD was a waste of money and the hour I took to listen to it is an hour I will never get back.  News reports say the new singer is already gone and will be replaced, not by Skye, but by yet another new girl.  After the brillance of the pre-"Antidote" library, I am forced to wonder:  What were the guys thinking+music
a rarity+P+i got hooked with "spinning", and then i reallized the whole album is just awesome, just awesome+music
Best song help I can give . . .+P+To everyone who is in search of a song from the movie go to this link for a scene by scene song list:   http://imdb.com/title/tt0286499/board/nest/224815  I hope this helps+music
Is this what I waited for all this time????+N+Once "Let's Get Free" came out, it lauched a revolutionary group that was powerful in their lyrics and made you feel their whole message.  After damn near burning another whole in this disk, I picked up their mixtape.  It was alright but I was waiting for that 2nd full length album continuing from the debut album.  I bought this on the 1st day it was released and was highly disappointed.  Most of the beats sound the same.  The album length is entirely TOO short.  I would have given this 3 stars because the album content is not awful.  But Dead Prez loses a lot of credibility when on the SAME ALBUM you say "turn off the radio" and 5 tracks later you collaberate on a song with Mr. Radio himself, Jay-Z.  That loses a star right there.  Was this an attempt to appeal to the very radio stations that you constantly blast for not playing real hip-hop?  Well, I live in the major city of Philadelphia and I haven't heard about this song burning up the airwaves nor did I hear about it topping the Billboard music charts.  Great job, guys+music

Thirty Seconds is still too much+N+Let's face it folks this is not a rock album that everyone believes it is. I will start by saying I didn't play the 30 second snippet for "All I Want To Do" because I knew it was already a lost cause, the rest were all just as bad. There are only 2 songs that may be a little bit o.k. and they are "Can't Cry Anymore", and "We Do What We Can". I just feel that this was a pop album all the way even though it has a rock edge don't be decieved. I don't know what she's like, or anything like that, but I do know she's beautiful, but while talented it's not the music I seek to listen to.+music
For The Piano Lover+P+Oh, Wow!  This is a cd that will be liked by all who enjoy David Lanz, Mehdi, George Winston, Yanni, or even Secret Garden. it is the very essence of good new age. So tranquil, yet so spirited (and finally a picture of the Kern on the coverart!), this cd is a refreshing break from my well-worn collection, I just keep wanting to listen to it over and over again. I am amazed!  It reminds me somewhat of George Winston, but still very unique. This is music to the soul. Absolutely relaxing, as well.   I ALSO RECOMMEND: Mehdi ~ Instrumental Heaven Volume 7 ..Truly a Gem...Samples are at SoothingMusic,Com...Just Listen.  +music
no good+N+yo this album was overrated and for no reason i'm not gone say that's it's plain garbage but if they had a betta team lyrical wise and a better production team then they would be alright. the best tracks on the whole thing is shawnna's gettin' some and the track call that's my S**+music
&lt;-- Damn, They Did It Again -->+P+My fancy apple pie a la mode gives me a happy face and shiny brown eyes. Knowing that I am an Independent Woman. I know I can find a sexy daddy who will bring me emotion and make me feel like I'm dangerously in love. Even though........ My story of beauty has a sweet, sassy gospel melody. I know I am talented. Forever I am not a nasty girl, I am forever bootylicious and I have my mother to thank. So I want to say thank you. But my goal in life is to become a suvivor like Destiny's Child did when they recorded this album.+music
No So Interesting+N+My wife introduced my to Tift Merritt's music when we were dating ... so I've got a soft spot for Tift and was really looking forward to hearing her second album, Tambourine. I'm disapointed.  There's not mush to this album. It's lost the alt-country sound and is more of a boring pop album. Bramble Rose is much, much more interesting+music
Wow!+P+This is my seventh Evans recording and it is like I am getting to know him all over again.  This album has energy, freshness and joy that just isn't there on later recordings.  The recording quality is more than satisfactory.  The group's playing is smart and engaging with a skillful balance between technical skill and understated musicality.  The playfulness brought to standards like Witchcraft is a welcome contrast to many of his later more brooding works.  LaFaro and Motian provide their legendary support and interplay with their typcial flair.  This was definitely a high point for Evans, before drugs, bad health and personal problems got in the way.  No Evans collection would be complete without this recording+music
You know exactly what you are going to get...+N+Michael Flatley's feet fly like a racehorse, but he is really a one trick pony. Now, if you like that one trick, you will like this (and every other) cd,and stageshow of his. If you are looking for something new, a progression of creativity, and expression, look elsewhere.    When Riverdance first appeared, I was a fan of the inovative blending of Broadway, traditional Irish step dancing, and new age mysticism. And The talent of all involved is undeniable.    But after other troops appear imitating the idea,and doing so almost as well. You must wonder why this artist deserves the loyalty of consumers buying the same , repackaged material over and over again.     Darwin would say that those things that don't evolve and adapt will become extinct. Unfortunately, it appears to be a slow lumbering death,for the thundering feet of this dinosaur+music
One of his best ever+P+There and Back was a change of pace for Jeff Beck. His sound became more electronic. This is a departure of his previous albums, Blow by Blow and Wired. Personally this along with Blow by Blow and Jeff Beck's Guitar Shop are my three favorte Jeff Beck albums ever. The two songs on this CD that will open your ears and get your attention are, Star Cycle. The entire album is worth the price of the CD. Star Cycle is not only great guitar but great keyboard as well. The combination of the two is outstanding. The Pump is also on this album. The Pump is probably in my top 5 for the best Jeff Beck songs ever. Jeff Beck uses distortion in much the same way Jimi Hendrix used it to augment his guitar style.  No Jeff Beck collection is complete without this album. This is my mind is one of the outstanding albums in Rock history. Jeff Beck is a master guitarist and this CD will show you why+music
Umm....+N+I'm a bit confused here.....  I can respect cutting-edge and new ideas. But this CD is neither+music
Never recived+N+Had to get a credit because Vendor never shipped and would not respond to email+music
Journey - 'Trial By Fire' (Sony)+N+Apparently,their last work with frontman Steve Perry and quite the let down.'Trial...' was the band's '96 comeback attempt,but if I remember correctly this CD was a stiff from the get-go.I tried SO hard to get into this fifteen track disc,but even with a duration of 68 minutes,I just couldn't.The songs don't completely suck,they just don't appear to have much life.Fantastic cover,don't you agree?If you're an old school Journey fan,I encourage you to check out their new 2005 release,'Generations' with vocalist Steve Augeri,who's been with the band for awhile now.That CD is surprisingly good,as I'd give it 3 1/2,maybe 4 stars.Keep in mind that guitarist Neal Schon is their 'key' player+music
The Best CD ever!... What a way to start the new year!...+P+This CD is awesome! There are four songs on the CD from Cinderella II, with Brooke Allison giving it her all and shining brightly. The new version of Bibbidi Bobbidid Boo is wonderful! They took the classical version from long ago and gave it a new twist which is sure to delight everyone of all ages! If you have enjoyed Walt Disney forever, like myself, or are just tuning in, you will love this album!..+music
Beautiful Voices+P+Bought this CD for my wife who is a big fan of traditional Irish music.  I love the beautiful voices.  The voice & instruments mix are very clear; one is not over powering the other+music
It is never the end when you are a fan for life+P+The doors continue to be a band I have new experiences with.  It is a great tribute that presents the mystical sounds and strange songwriting that is only capped off by the voice and presence of Jim Morrison.  This two CD package is an integral part of my music collection, but more importantly it is because it is a truly great collection of their music.  Even if you are a younger person who is new to the Doors, this is a great place to start if you so choose!    I had the original set and later retired it to acquire the Digitally Remastered version shown here on Amazon.  All the classic door songs are here, which on the first CD include songs like "Break on through", "Love me two times", and the dark and dreamy "Spanish Caravan".  CD Number 2 is no less important with songs that range from "L.A. Woman", "Riders on the storm" to one of my favorites called "The Unknown Soldier".  Overall it is an amazing collection of hits when you just take a step back and look at what you get if you purchase this+music
Great CD+P+This is a great cd to listen to.  If you like Patsy Cline you will definitely want this cd.  Not every singer can do Patsy justice but LeAnn does and I would certainly recommend this cd+music
Not Worth the Time or Money+N+Puddle of Mudd exploded into the contemporary pop/rock scene around 2000.  This album is representative of their entire catalogue.  For those music fans who want to hear true hard rock, pick up a good copy of any early Led Zeppelin or Black Sabbath.  For anyone wanting true grunge, pick up any copy of an Alice in Chains, Soundgarden, or Nirvana album.  Puddle of Mudd shamelessly (and inaccurately) self-promotes their band/sound as both hard-rock and grunge, while living up to neither.  Since most of their fans seem to be pretty young, they've been able to pull this sham off, mainly because their audience has never been exposed to any of the aforementioned bands...and honestly has no desire to listen to any older music.  The songs on this album are extremely redundant, with little variation of riffs or overall aesthetics from one track to the next.  The lyrics are horribly compiled to offer nothing more than a vocal rhythm and subpar content.  This album is a waste of both time and money for anyone interested in listening to any worthwhile rock+music
Bulgarian Dancehall+P+Gypsy violin, dancehall beats, horns somewhere between Jazz Jamaica and Klezmer, transylvanian-intoned singer. Wry lyrics. Simply a blast. Bought this blind and I love it+music
The best metal album ever!+P+THIS IS THE BEST ALBUM AND BAND I'VE EVER HEARD BETTER THAN METALLICA, PANTERA, MEGADETH, FAITH NO MORE ETC. ETC. ETC. ALL OF THE SONGS ARE GREAT BUT ESPECIALLY WAR ENSEBLE DEAD SKIN MASK AND SEASONS IN THE ABYSS+music
THE BEST OF THE BEST+P+A+++ THE BEST IVE EVER HEARD BYE THE DODRO MASTE+music
fair...just fair+N+the offspring..a band who draws inspiration from some of the best music around(the damned, TSOL, agent orange, adolescents, and DI), have great record label that is responsible for new records/re-issues from TSOL, The Damned, and other great legendary punk artists, and a band who used to be really great punk revival have truly disappointed me with records like this.  i fell in love with the offspring when i bought smash..after that, i proceeded to collect ignition and ixnay.and still, i loved them..but i was iffy on this..i mean i knew of songs like pretty fly and why dont you get a job and how bad they were, but songs like kids arent alright made me a buyer...i must say, i was rather impressed with this and decided that i underrated it...that was 3 years ago.  now, i think this album is just okay..i mean its good enough to be able to warrant a stay on my windows media player on my laptop, but as for keeping the disc, it isnt.  i say get this..get it cheap..rip it to your comp and then sell off. it gets old fast+music
The absolute best primer for Jazz initiates+P+While my musical tastes span a wide range of genres, I've long been intrigued by jazz and the blues - both are enigmatic and haunting, yet not exactly a part of popular music today. So it was with great expectations that I purchased this set, hoping for a strong foundation upon which I could explore the giants of jazz - and eventually work my way down to contemporary jazz artists.   This collection fits that bill beyond compare. Some favorites I already knew are here, such as Glenn Miller and Benny Goodman - along with sublime jazz geniuses such as Coleman Hawkins, Count Basie, and Charlie Parker. Sure, as other reviewers have noted, the set is a bit heavy on Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington, but I doubt you'll be disappointed with any of the tracks included here.   Aside from the wonderful music, you also receive an informative and beautifully designed booklet. It includes not only an essay on the origins of jazz, but a song-by-song write up that's unequaled by any other collection I've purchased. I'm more than up to date on jazz music, as well as gaining a profound appreciation for the genre.   Simply put, if you're curious about jazz as I once was, this is the absolute perfect way to initiate yourself into the library of jazz. (On a side note, if you want a great blues primer, I'd suggest the Martin Scorsese set.+music
When are they gonna make another Art of Trans?+N+GRitS are at their best when the underlying foundation of a song is a strong (catchy) melody. Witness "They All Fall Down," and "Here We Go." On "Redemption," Coffee and Bone seemed to have abandoned their original purpose of making the most innovative hip-hop in the industry and have made an album that merely bites what is on the playlist of any top 40 rap station in the country. Under the guidance of the production team of Otto Price and Ric Robbins, collectively known as Incorporated Elements, GRitS made their most memorable hits: all of which followed the above-mentioned formula. Now these 3 albums, made after their departure/dismissal, have exposed Bone and Cof's greatest weakness: the inability to make compelling beats. - FYI: Pigeon John makes "Open Bar" the strongest track.      +music
Continual Slide+N+Mack 10 seems to have lost it.  Like Ice Cube with War and Peace, he tries to sound hard with an edge but you can tell he's trying too hard.  He seems to have lost his hunger along with Ice Cube after the Westside Connection album.  This is probably 10's worst album has he continues to fall.  WC's the only hope for the old Westside Connection.  Mack 10's gangsta believability is very very questionable after putting out a pretty lousy album here+music
Practice Doesn't Always Make Perfect+N+I vividly remember when this album came out, it was among a handful that ushered in the hippie era.  Of course one always associates the Grateful Dead with LSD, the Hell's Angels, and poor personal hygiene.  But their contribution goes far beyond that.  Music was the life's-blood of Flower Power, and what this album loudly proclaimed was that anyone, anyone, no matter how talentless and drug-addled, could start a band, provided that access to a garage was no problem.  This came as welcome news to the legions of talentless, drug-addled kids who consequently folded The Dead into their collective bosom.  The complete absence of musicianship is precisely what made The Grateful Dead so appealing.  Their songs, both unoriginal and poorly executed, were never more complex than the average Highlights crossword puzzle. Chord changes seemed more like questions than statements and guitar solos wandered in a stupefied haze lacking both point and direction.  Most egregious of all was the singing which hovered somewhere between horrifying and unforgivable.  But listen again, and remember that this album was recorded 40 years ago.  Then consider that the Dead have toured more consistently than the Stones, shlepping their zonked-out noodles from one end of the globe to the other, jamming interminably until the cows came home - presumably in an attempt to silence them.    Then play something recent by The Dead and let the penny slowly drop.  The music is still horrible and they still can't sing.  All that work, wasted.  It's a shame.  Had they invested that much energy into something for which they were suited, like repairing automatic transmissions, just think how high they might have soared+music
Psychedelic Punk You Can Dance To..It May Sound Better Now Than It Did In 1967.+P+The fast spontaneous furious speed of this 1st album from the seminal improvisational band is nothing less than a spectacular experience far ahead of it's time. The Dead were fine musicians, always respected and paid homage to their influences by developing a unique hybrid of traditional blues and country,folk,jug and rock and roll within in a jazz setting. Creating a new form emulated by so many of their contemporaries within rock may not have been their intention, but that is a defining element of their historical importance.  The sense of immediacy and existential NOW is keenly felt here.  Even the few tracks clocked in at 5 minutes or higher have a primal energy to it and is danceable..The beauty of this album is that it totally debunks the notion that the Dead were a jam band only and were not capable of laying down great songs in time spans under 3 minutes.They knew how to have a good time..   This CD features so many in concert staples later stretched out into what became Dead Head music listening to it again with the extra tracks and hdcd is very refreshing. The homage paid to their wide musical roots and upping it by creating dynamic interesting music interplaying in 1967 double guitars and later a dual drum attack into some unique synthesis that is both old and new was and is a rare accomplishment.+music
The fall of Hooverphonic continues+N+Once Hooverphonic was a great band. Their first album with the brilliant singer Liesje Sadonius was brilliant and also the second album was great with Geike singing quite good. Then came a decent third album with a couple of good moments followed bye a very dissapointing 4. album, a live album I did not want to invest in, and now this even worse album. I have heard it once, and I don't think I will ever hear it again. Not that it is horrible, but it is just not worth spending my time for, and Geike has now lost all the beauty in her voice, and now sings quite badly most of the time in my opinion. I surtenly miss Liesje Sadonius' beutiful voice in this band. Anyone knows what has happened to her? But back to the album and the conclusion. If you did like Hooverphonics first albums best, then do not buy this and be dissapointed once again. But if you did like the 4. album, you will surely also like this.+music
GREAT+P+All the great songs you remember from Donny & Marie.  Love em'  ALL. +music
Look for an import+N+Forget about this. You can get these tracks, better remastered in the Definitive or Proper labels. They got them here at Amazon. This   edition is a joke+music
Excellent!!!!+P+I love it.  Christina really brought the Holiday Spirit to life in this CD.  This is one of my most favorite CDs...I'm listening to it right now. +music
Another solid set.+P+This disc will bring back some pleasant memories. Any disc with &quot;Drift Away&quot; on it is almost worth purchasing no matter what else is on it. This one just happens to have &quot;Brother Louie&quot; &quot;It  Never Rains In Southern California&quot; and &quot;Stuck In The Middle With  You&quot;. The sound quality is exceptional, just like any disc by Rhino+music
Good, but why buy this when there is Smiling Phases!?!?!?+N+For a penny less, you can get every song on "Feelin's Alright" AND ELEVEN MORE SONGS from the compilation Smiling Phases.  Sure, this one disc compilation contains *great music* but what shmoe would buy it when you can get more music on 2-CDs for less money????  Perhaps another reviewer can fill me in on the "logic" of buying this over Smiling Phases because I don't see it+music
Just buy Built to Spill albums instead...+N+really an album that should be played in the background, if at all - it's slow and wandering music won't keep your attention for long and rightly so. and other reviewers are correct about the lyrics, if you're still paying attention you'll be less than impressed.  i'm amazed at how many reviews can be written here with absolutely no reference to Built to Spill - a band this album really really wants to be. it's true that this album, with its guitar work and focus on an atmosphere over progression, sounds VERY VERY much like  parts of the Built to Spill albums. but would i compare this album to BTS? or Death Cab? no chance. it's just got nothing to offer other than background - nothing is being created here. no novelty. the horns people talk about in other reviews are out of place and forced - like your best friend's idea you can't talk him out of.   two stars seems a little harsh, but it's a gift. i can't honestly recommend people buy this album when you can get Built to Spill or Death Cab for Cutie albums which give you this and so so much more.  ****UPDATE**** trust me, the Built to Spill comparison is valid. everyone should go listen to them both and i promise you'll get it+music
Swingin'!+P+Another beautiful album by Ms. Sutton and the band. Their musicianship is a joy. The swingin', "I'm with the Band," is a lot of fun+music
DEFINITELY A MUST HAVE, MAN!!!!!+P+look here, i knew that there was more to this band than EXPRESS YOURSELF.  this cd more than satisfied that.  everything on here bumps.  i can do without the slow stuff, but overall, mr. wright and company DID THEY THANG!!!!!  UHHHHH!!!!  i love charles' voice; especially on YOUR LOVE (MEANS EVERYTHING TO ME).  that stands out because it sounds like his voice was all shot and he still found something in it to deliver.  if you like true blue funkiness, then get this.  it is cats and bands like this that never get played on the radio, which sucks, that really bring that sausage gravy vibe.  you will understand that latter once you cop this or download it+music
Electronic Noise+N+I got this CD from a local music store and couldn't wait to listen to it. Unfortunately, there is nothing good to say about this mix. Please read the other reviews written by people who have evaluated this mix (including my other reviews) before you make your purchase on this one, and see whether you agree with their taste of music by how they have rated other mixes. You will be surprised to learn that most of the people who gave rave reviews about J.Z Alive mix are not into this type of music to begin with.   I have never come across a compilation as bad as this one. Sure you can force yourself to like it, like other reviewers, but be true to yourself. This comp. did not even give me a reason to want to give it another chance. Usually there will be something, either a good track, an awesome outro/intro mix, a flow or something that pulls you to give another listen to a CD that otherwise you might think "NAAA". J.Z's Alive mix is actually dead; no emotion, no soul, no intelligence, just pure electronic noise+music
put together too quickly and it shows!!!!!+N+First of all, let me say that i think Billy Klippert should have been the Canadian idol. Buy his album as it is far more superior to this one in every way.  Now, objectively speaking, i do believe Ryan Malcolm has a nice voice in its natural range, but at times Ryan is stretching it in this album.  I believe most of the songs sound the same, and truly there is just not enough variety on this album, at times i feel like im listening to elevator music.  I think if the producers took alittle more time constructing this album the result wouldve been alot better. Now i do think his release single &quot;something more&quot; is catchy, nice hooks and sentimental lyrics, but unfortunately its the only gem on this album.  Buy the single and forget the album.  I believe Canadian idol fans should give Billy's new album a try, YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!!+music
Too much Monkey Business+N+Only 8 tracks and some of them real soppy..don't waste your time or money+music
This Sure Ain't  "Buried In Oblivion"+N+The new edition (vocalist Stu Block) has killed the perfect vocal line-up w/ his ridiculous, overkilled "80's power metal" screams.  It just doesn't fit & it ruins the few songs w/ potential on this release, which is a far cry from the last one anyway. There's nowhere near as much melody in the music & pitifully few vocal harmonies, further widening the gap from Oblivion. I keep listening ... hoping it'll grow on me & I'll somehow eventually get past the new festering puss-sore, nails-on-a-chalkboard style vocals, but it just ain't hap'nin.  Fortunately for the band tho, it would seem I'm the odd man out b/c all these other reviews seem to be raving. I sincerely hope no one else is as disappointed as I am. These guys have so much more talent & ability than comes thru on this cd. Better luck next time fellas+music
Great follow up to an excellent debut+P+Wonderful band out of Poland. I do have a few minor detractions to this album (as well as their last one); 1) I think with a little bit better mix and master these guys could really break very well into North America. 2) I could easily do without the opening 35-40 sec. of whispering. If the album had started right away with the beautiful       a-capella that is the opening track "After", easily could've developed a much more receptive mood from the listener IMO. Highly recommended.+music
past his prime+N+Long-time Waits fan here, with several of his albums being on my all-time favorites list. I owned this album for nearly a year, before I traded it in. It took me a while to figure out why I always wandered out of the room after a few songs and forgot about it--because it s--ks. The lyrics  either are incoherent, just strung together (eg Get Behind Mule), or veer off into the cringingly sentimental (eg House Where Nobody Lives, Chocolate Jesus). The music mostly drags, when it's not downright grating. He's lost it. You can't blame him for not knowing it, I guess. But it's long past time to write him off--since Bone Machine. (The stage works Black Rider, Alice, and Blood Money, show a consistent weakness--a lack of focus lyically as well as musically, not to mention a lot of low fi recording. I had a similar experience where it took me a few years to realized why I kept skipping tracks on Black Rider--because it mostly su-ks--and treaded it.)   He peaked with the Island trilogy. My personaly favorite is Frank's Wild Years. Before the far-out sound, he also produced a lot of real poetry along with his jazz-club shtick. Now his writing seems almost like senile mumbling. And his thematic concerns hvae descended/ degenerated into the likes of loving family life. Is there any chance of a renascence? (Not as yet based on a sampling of Real Gone.)   All the kids who have caught onto the Waits thing need try to think a lot harder about these songs and compare them to songs on Rain Dogs and Swordfishtrombones. Back then even when the references and language were oblique, or obscure, they developed a story or an image or a sentiment. It built from line to line--developed an idea, with continuity.  Now it's mostly a string of stylized cr-p, using the vocabulary he developed all his life but to no end.+music
bad BAD B-A-D+N+I've ordered the collection with one thought in mind: ohh boy! a good irish collection.  i was astonished to hear SYNTHESIZED(!) music instead of the real instruments - no violins here, no bagpipes, no flutes!  only synthesized music! this collection had much potential but it was killed!  not to mention the annoying rain sounds. ok - their nice for starts but they dont stop all thru the album and sometimes the music gets engulfed in them totaly.  BAD+music
Only the Lord knows+P+Probably only the Lord knows why I love this album so much. Like another reviewer, my wife and son won't let me play it while their around, so I play and sing along with it while I am alone in the car. Yes, Leon's voice is terrible to some, a little whiney to some but that is what gives the album its charm. You can hardly sing worse! The song selections are classic. The band is great. I love the steel guitars of Pete Drake, Curly Chalker, Weldon Myrick, and Hal Rugg. Then you have the classic Dobro of Tut Taylor on Uncle Pen! What more is there to love+music
Do you actually listen to music????+N+Firstly, how many of the people that have bought this album heard a track or two on the radio? Maybe you saw him on TV? Maybe you bought it because it's 'cool' to like this kind of music at the moment? That's right, you probably listen to any kind of music (no matter the quality) that has been forced down your throat repeatedly.  James Blunt (and many other mainstream acts) represent what is wrong with the world today. Most people don't five a f**k about music when it comes down to it, and are quite happy to listen to what is paraded in front of them. I urge you (if you've read this far), to try and find music YOURSELF. Distance yourself from the media machine - you might just be suprised.  As for this album: It's completely derivative, with every element done 100 times better 30 thirty years ago. James Blunt has a terrible voice - the comparisons to a cat being strangled mentioned elsewhere are accurate, although it sounds like the cat is also passing out razors. The songs are dull and predictable, the 'emotions' having been well planned out in an A+R meeting at the record company.  Yet this album is extremely popular and acclaimed by many. A sad state of affairs indeed...+music
Best Hiphop album of the year+P+This band was on the great hiphop group for the late 1980s. They pretty much did everything that was innovative fifteen years ago. Public Enemy and NWA got more attention at the time. They paved the way for other innovators like Beastie Boys and De La Soul. Ten years later they would influence The Prodigy's The Fat of The Land. Kool Keith would continue and make great records later. But this was back in the day of the fade haircut. That was the hype thing to do. Each song on this record is a hit. "Ego Trippin" is some of the hardest hitting slamming music of all time. "Traveling At The Speed Of Thought" is an example how advanced they were lyrically. Public Enemy was more political and NWA was more gangster. Ultramagnetic MCs were like poetry in a way that Tupac Shakar isn't. "Give The Drummer Some" is one of their best songs. Like Public Enemy, they were influenced by the beats of James Brown. Critical Beatdown is one of the great albums of all time. It needs to be recognized. This album also contains six extra tracks like "A Chorus Line." This is where things started. The 1980s were a harder time for hiphop to get known. This record reminds me of Mike Daley. We used to listen to hiphop and play video games.+music
spirit lifting+P+This is a great cd, almost every song had me swaying in my seat at my computer.  The tunes have a slightly meditative effect, but are still lively and funky even.  Highly recommended, Krishna Lila will transport you to a far-off land of exotic colourful streets and purple sunsets+music
A Major 5+P+The Music here is very well Crafted.Mccoy Tyner still has that touch.Al  Foster is Tight on Skins.Stanley Clarke just gets better with time.I Have  Followed Mccoy Tyner's Music for a Long Long time.Nobody ever Sounds Like  they once did but you hope as the Artist age that they get better with  time&amp;Enhance their craft.Mccoy Tyner has been Hit&amp;Miss at times but  he brings back the juice on this set.The Chemistry really works well  here.You Feel The Soul&amp;Passion on The Instrumentation of These Great  Musicians+music
Fantastic Album from the most underrated rock group ever!+P+Every track from this rich, warm LP blows you away. Everything from Pete Ham's and George Harrison's slide guitars on "Day After Day" to Ham's hauntingly aching "Take It All." Every rock and pop fan should pick this CD up before it slips out of print. Badfinger initially were on the Beatles' Apple Records label before they moved to Warner Brothers in 1973/74. Every album recorded by this incredibly gifted band is worth it - "Magic Christian Music," "No Dice" (which ties with "Straight Up" as the best LP, "Ass," "Badfinger," "Wish You Were Here" and "Head First." Any fan of the Beatles, The Who, Hendrix, Cream/Clapton and everyone else from the late 1960s/early 1970s should pick up Badfinger's discs. This was the band that Rolling Stone magazine said, in 1970, is the group "to watch for" in the coming years.  It's a shame their manager, S. Polly, was such a thief and robbed the band of royalties and potential fame, which concluded with Ham's suicide in 1975 and bassist Tom Evans' suicide in 1983. Drummer MIke Gibbons, sadly, passed away late last year, leaving only guitarist-vocalist Joey Molland as the band's sole survivor. Rest in peace guys!  P.S. Don't be turned off by The Beatles comparisons - Badfinger had a sound, song structures and style all to their own, which will please both fans of The Beatles and those who don't care for the Fab Four. Power pop-rock was never better than the early 1970s records from Badfinger. (Actually, Badfinger's output was as good as most of the solo Beatles work in the early 1970s.+music
One of 2pac's best+P+This is easily in the top 3 of 2pac's best cds.  It is one of the best and he is still at death row+music
Sorry...+N+My wife and I love Govi's music but am little tired that he keeps re-doing the same music over and over+music
Exellent cd by this pioneering jazz vocal group...+P+The Boswell Sisters were the 1st group to truly use jazz in vocal harmony, there arrangements by lead singer Connie Boswell were innovative, and full of jazz syncopations and the blues.  This pioneering jazz vocal group would influence and pave the way for groups as diverse as Lambert, Hendricks & Ross to todays Take 6.  A great cd of great new Orleans jazz harmony vocals.  The Bozzies are backed here by combos that feature such solosists as Bunny barigan, Eddie Lang, Joe Venuti, Jimmy & Tommy Dorsey, among others+music
Sweet!!!+P+I think Daves latest effort is a winner. I love the "urban feel" to this CD and hope he makes more like this one. I see and hear why the single "Honey Dipped" stayed at #1 for so many months...+music
Deffinately a good start for the radio.+P+This is the guitarist from Jonah's (yeah, yeah, yeah; Jonah's this, Jonah's that) former band Far. This is a really good footing for the radio in it's current state. I have a question though: WHEN THE HECK IS THAT QUICKSAND TRIBUTE ALBUM SUPPOSED TO COME OUT?! K; bug the heck out of this band if you ever see them and ask them about the Quicksand tribute album that was supposed to come out like  5 years ago (it was also supposed to have Ray Cappo from Youth of Today and Shelter, Chaka Malik from Burn and Orange 9mm, Glassjaw, Biohazard and a bunch of other incredibly talented people). Ta ta+music
Torch it!+N+I am a big fan of Pattie Lupone but as a torch singer she has a long way to go to catch up to the likes of fellow singers Linda Eder and others.  I was very disappointed in this CD+music
Magnificant+P+Animal Farm is the best film score I have ever heard. It's beautiful and haunting on so many levels. The songs really convey the emotion of the film(which is really good, by the way)Beasts of the World is really reminiscent of the Communist Revolution. The Theme Storm of Judgment resonates with the hope of the animals as well the darkness of Napoleon's reign. Highly recommended+music
Perfect+P+Throw all the Luna albums together on iPod, hit random, and any of their songs that fill one cd are a best of.  I couldn't stand them until I shut up and listened two years ago+music
Message to Korn+N+Youve all lost your minds.Please take a break.2 years or so.In this time listen to your first cd.Notice the awesome sound???The bass,the drums.Notice the singer friggin going crazy.Now when you make the next cd make sure the tone is exactly the same as the first.Exactly.Nothing different.It was perfect.Like KFC chicken!!!Also Jon,start wearing the Adidas suit again and maybe youll have a flashback and start singing with true emotion again.Also get rid of the lame Masters of the Universe mic stand!Money has destroyed yet another great band!!!!+music
A five*star* stunner+P+I purchased the re-mastered version, and it sounds like it is live, i.e, you are there, only clearer.  The songs are breathtaking, heart-breakingly lovely, and overflowing with joy, like a cool spring breeze blowing on you with the hot sun above.  Sorry, Pat -- I think I broke that one getting it out.+music
Ladies In Lavender CD+P+The film "Ladies In Lavender" is touching and a tear jerker, but, so well done. Having the film on DVD was not enough, I needed to have the CD to play when I am driving. The violin virtuosity of Joshua Bell is magnificient and so pleasing to hear when relaxation is desired+music
Sachmo - mmmmm+P+What can I say about this CD except "mmmmm". Ya gotta love it, this CD has a range of songs that will fulfill anyones desire for some of Mr Armstrongs' special treatment. Get it, play it, love it+music
BORING+N+Shedaisy does NOT have the staying power. In a few years everyone will be saying "Shedaisy WHO?" Their music is very forgettable!+music
Excellent, upbeat and perfect for a happy season!+P+This is the happiest, most upbeat Christmas music I've ever heard.  It'll bring a smile to your face instantly+music
He has evolved+P+The fact remains that everyone wants a Jonny Lang cd that sounds like every other Jonny Lang CD. He is amazing. Noone could believe that such a young guy could have such a soulful voice. His soulfullness has not changed just the main sound of it. This CD provided me with the satisfaction to see how versitile his music can be and I was VERY pleasantly suprised. I recommend this cd to any Jonny fan because he has proved that he is an ever evolving music artist. Amazing+music
Jonny, what have you done to yourself?+N+This disc is a huge disappointment! What happened to the young blues guitar slinger I really liked? He has completely changed his style and I was hoping we finally had a new blues musician that would grow and grow into a blues great! This in not blues at all. I suspect his producers at A&M thought they saw someone to make money from, but this is eclectic garbage although his voice is still great. Go back to what you do best Jonny - blues.+music
Bigger than the Hit Parade+P+Listening to an album like this makes you despise the record industry and the way that fashions and slavish conformity dictate success.   The Buffalo Skinners was released in 1993, two years after Big Country had been callously and stupidly dropped by Phonogram. They then produced this astounding masterpiece, in which every track is solid and some "Pink Marshmallow Moon," "Alone," etc. - are sheer classics. Of course, gurning teenagers with grungey guitars were all the rage at the time, so the craftsmanship and quality of this earnest and soulfull collection of songs went largely unrecognised.   Big Country created a sound that could fill not only stadiums and arenas but also the vast landscapes of their native and their adopted land.+music
Must have!+P+This amazingly beautiful album to me is the soundtrack of Anatolia, of an era gone by when Turks, Greeks, Armenians and other ethnic groups shared their lives peacefully and harmoniously.  Its sadness inevitably reminds me of millions who unnecessarily died on this soil in many wars fought in early twentieth century, of people forced to leave the only land the knew for unknown destinations and destinies, of the unimaginable hardships endured by its people. And more personally it takes me fom New York and puts me right next to my father's grave in a forgotten Anatolian village, 6000 miles away+music
Shocked+N+I am shocked.  I would have at least thought that the beats on Shock Value were going to be good (to make up for the fact that Timbaland can't rap to save his life).  Even Timbaland talks about how much money he makes for beats in his "hit track" with Nelly Furtado and JT.  It's too bad that he sold all his hot beats to other artists and didn't keep any for himself.  One thing that he isn't is better than Scott Storch.  Keep dreaming Timbaland.  You are nothing more than a wanna-be Lil' John looping your 'yeah's and 'oooooh's in every track that sounds the same as the one before.+music
Good Album+P+Lily Allen mixes hip-hop with a pop sound.  She's got catchy, easy to listen to music+music
Digging Lily+P+When i first saw lily on these 15 minute mtv skits in the morning i knew i had to look her up. Thank god i did!!! I love her music! Lily gives off this i don't care i'm me vibe and she speaks from the heart. The album is amazing!!   Best songs: Smile LDN Littlest things Nan your a window shopper+music
i do not like this album+N+i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this albu+music
Antichrist super-ripoff+N+Alright, here goes the first intelligent low rating this album has recieved. No I'm not some christian preaching to you, I'm actually a fan of manson. I think the lyrics on this album are pretty good, but mediocre music. My main problem with this album is the fact that it is a total rip-off of david bowie. Let's look at the man himself. Manson wears contacts to make it look like he has two different colored eyes, while bowie actually has two different eyes. With Ziggy Stardust, Bowie's image became androgynous, just as manson's always has been. Now let's look at the actual albums of Ziggy and Antichrist. They both tell the story of a self-destructive unearthly rock and roll superstar. Manson's shock rock symbol even bears a strong resemblance to the Ziggy Lightning bolt. And this all comes from a man constantly preaching individualiry, while making an idol of himself, and slamming other artists for ripping him off. And then he put out mechanical animals, an exact replica of ziggy stardust, and ironically enough it's what made him truly famous. I just think it's a little hypocritical. Check out Holy Wood. It is much better lyrically and musically, and far more original. The other thing that really pisses me off is the vocal department. A lot of fans are saying his voice is underated, but i hate to say, he really can't sing. Watch the guns god and government tour and see how he really sounds. All he's basically good for are his writing skills..+music
Desmond's creative period+P+Paul Desmond is well known and broadly admired for his bell-like sound (tone), but this set of recordings well demonstrates the inventive quality of his earlier sesions.  His interaction with Mulligan in this piano-free quartet environment brings out the chromatics that might be missed in the Brubeck era recordings. Among his really best.+music
My newest obsession+P+I'm not particularly interested in Punk music, I prefer roots/americana/folk and on the other hand 70's and 80's rock music. I, like so many others, heard Dropkick's song on "The Departed" and it's gripping sound drew me in to purchase the album. I am now 100% certain that I will sooner or later end up with every album in their catalog. To tell you the truth, I've abandoned the other 1,000 songs on my iPod for 13 of the 14 tracks on this album. The songs are anthem-like, brawl-inspiring, rugby-esque. Music that goes well with a side of raw meat. I am glad I bought this album before the earlier ones, it's mature and established sound helped hook me. I can't wait (now) to get into the grittier earlier tunes+music
Perfect for Meditation and Yoga+P+I'd have to disagree with the review that called this &quot;new age kitchenette music&quot;.  I find it difficult to meditate to music that has a lot of polarity to it or forces me to listen to it instead of listening to my inner self.  The songs flow together.  It may seem repetitious at times, but the songs are subtly individualistic.  This group is anything but 'Americanized'.  They're a great blend of Indian, Arab and African flavor with a dash of Celtic.  The music also is the ideal pace for yoga as well, yet soft enough even to sleep to+music
elevator music+N+i agree, if you don't want to waste postage mailing this cd set back don't waste your time. wasn't even the original songs you would normally hear on the oldies radio stations+music
I agree, don't bother+N+MADACY, the company that makes this CD box set, does not include the original songs, but remakes. I bought this set because it was was cheap. Cheap is exactly what I got. Try the &quot;Have a Nice Day&quot; series.+music
Cry Of Love+P+Back in the 70's I wore out my vinyl copy of Hendrix's Cry Of Love Album. Songs like, Drifting and My Friend have been floating around in my head for all these years and I had tried to find a copy of CRY Of Love on cd several times with no luck. Well, here it is under a different name and with some additional songs ! These are some of the best cuts Jimi Hendrix ever recorded and the music sounds as good today as it did when I was a kid. Absolutely great stuff. +music
LA CHAT is RaW+P+My opinion is: La chat is a tyte raw female rapper, with 3 six adding her to the camp, she brings the murder murder. I have to say she is much much more leathal then Gangsta Boo. This is a must buy cd if your a tru Triple six fan+music
Instant Favorite+P+Although it only has a few selections by Evans, this interview gives some real insight into his approach and thought process.  Recorded only two years before his untimely death in 1980, it shows the mature performer at the top of his game+music
What's so freakin' great about this?+N+I hate AC/DC, them and Metallica are extremely overrated in the metal department.  As musicians, these guys are very average AT BEST, most of the time, they're below average.  It doesn't matter if it's Bon Scott or Brian Johnson singing for them, AC/DC has always sucked.  Unlike other metal bands like Slayer and Sepultura, AC/DC's songs are very cheesy and boring, the only thing this is good for is the whiff of nostalgia.  Want real 80's metal (not glam)?  Go for Slayer, Sepultura, Kreator, Exodus, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Mercyful Fate, Hellhammer and many others+music
Not for my son!+N+My mother-in-law bought this soundtrack for my son who is 4 years old.  We trusted that since this was a Disney/Pixar movie that the sound track would be appropriate for kids as the movie is geared towards children.  However, there is a song on there by Chingy (who I not heard of until we heard this soundtrack) that is VERY sexualy suggestive.  Here is one verse from the song.   I like the way you look in them pants, see ya fine (fine) Lil momma a quarter piece, she far from a dime (dime) The type of girl that'll getcha' up and go make you grind (grind) I'm thinkin' about snatchin' her up, dirty, makin' her mine Look at her hips, (what?) look at her legs, ain't she stacked? (stacked) I sure wouldn't mind hittin' that from the back (back) I like it when I touch it cuz she moan a l'il bit Jeans saggin' so I can see her thong a l'il bit I know you grown a little bit, twenty years old, you legal Don't trip off my people, just hop in the regal I swooped on her like an eagle swoopin' down on its prey I know you popular, but you gon' be famous today   I am appalled that such a song would be on this soundtrack.  If your children are older and you don't mind this kind of music I would recommend this CD as the rest of the songs are really good.  However if your children are young and you don't wish for them to be exposed to this type of song I would STRONGLY NOT recommend this CD+music
Mark O'Connor Plays Everything+P+This is a terrific showcase for O'Connor's remarkable prowess on the fiddle as he moves flawlessly from one style to the next, cajun, bluegrass, old-time, he tackles it all while surrounding himself with some of the best country musicians I have ever heard such as steel guitar player Paul Franklin and piano player Matt Rollins.  Mostly these are up-tempo instrumental tracks but there are also a few vocal tracks included.  If you want to hear musicians playing for musicians, this is a great CD+music
credit where credit is due+N+this is not a review of this compilation, but please note, CSNY fans, that while their version of "Woodstock" may be the more familiar one, the song was written by Joni Mitchell. Listen to her own (comletely different) performance of it on her "Ladies of the Canyon" (1970) album+music
bad+N+honestly, i think this is horrible nothing catchy or good about it..all the songs sound the same just nothing syticks out...there last cd was the same thing but a little better. if your gonna buy one bleeding through cd i recommend portrait of the goddess...stay away from thi+music
Vintage Rodney+P+&quot;What's in a Name&quot; is a perfect taste of Rodney's early years in the nightclub scene. You can even hear glasses hitting glasses and other various club noises in the background. He's a little toned down, but you  still get tons of his trademark &quot;I Don't Get No Respect&quot; jokes.  If you want to hear some of Rodney's greatest jokes before they were really  famous and you don't want to spend a lot of money, this is the CD for you.  I'm really happy my friend, Kevin McCarthy bought it for me+music
Incredible+P+There is no doubt in my mind that this is the finest recording of Handel's Messiah available. As said before by other reviewers, the voices are very clean, unlike some renditions that sound like they are performing a Wagnerian Opera. These are definitely some of the most beautiful voices I have ever heard (Bravo especially to the tenor). Diction is excellent. The sound quality is very good, and it is on period instruments. This is one of my favorite sets. Very highly recommended. However, I had some trouble obtaining a copy of this recording, and there is a possibility that it has gone out of print, so hurry+music
Nothing compared to his first album.+N+Mack 10 couldn't do it twice.  His first album is tight, but this one  lacks good beats.  Also, his rapping style is too lame to carry the off  beats.  The only way could have saved the album is if he would have had  alot of guest rappers and producers+music
Excellent!+P+A great selection of Italo-Dance songs with some other good songs as the upper tracks.  Overall a wonderful CD+music
Melodious Madeliene, Magnificent!+N+I love her relaxed phrasing and the tone and easy flow of her vocal+music
jumpin'+P+And when I say jumpin', I mean what I'm doing in my kitchen while this CD is playing.  I've seen the show twice, and it's like a drug that I just want again and again.  But this is the next best thing.  The show is so good, but the music creates such images in my mind that I don't miss it as much.  My kids dance to it with me and my wife, and we all just groove to the beat.  I can't help but think that BMG reminds methat I live in a cyberpunk novel, and the music gives me a soundtrack for the day.  I love this+music
One Sexy CD+P+I'm loving the CD. They have a great sound....sensuous and chill. I first heard their music on a compilation CD. They play some of their tracks on  Nip/Tuck too.+music
Disappointing...+N+...and i'm a Charlap fan. High hopes. But this recording, though given star treatment/art department/high gloss packaging with liner notes by playwright John Guare, is listless and uninspiring. Yes, nicely arranged and all that, but airless. It never breathes; it rarely swings...A couple new chord interpolations, one tempo surprise, one or two harmonic sparks -- way too few and far between to recommend. Pastel. Pleasant. But miles from jazz. If you want to hear Bernstein songs in a &quot;nice&quot; piano trio format with few challenging ideas, this is for you. Bill Evans is the standard for &quot;Lucky To Be Me&quot; and &quot;Some Other Time.&quot; Oscar Peterson / Andre Previn for the &quot;West Side&quot; soundtrack. Much promise goes unfulfilled here..+music
great!!+P+Nice to finally have a compilation of hits from the greatest female rapper EVER! Beware it is explicit+music
The Comprehensive Lenny Bruce+P+Finally! the boxed set we've all been waiting for. Lenny Bruce was, no question about it, the greatest stand-up comic of all time. He stood alone and unafraid, holding up a mirror to the face of a sick, hypocrtical society that didn't like what was reflected. For this he payed the ultimate price.     I'm not 100 percent crazy about this collection. For the Lenny Bruce collector there will be disappointments in light of the fact that some of the material has been released before. The booklet that comes with it also contains some eye-popping errors of fact. Still, it has alot of pleasant surprises and I reccomend it to anyone who is discovering the genius of Lenny Bruce for the first time.  He once said, "People should be taught what is, not what should be. All my humor is based on destruction and despair and tomorrow, if the world became tranquil without disease or violence, I'd be standing on the breadline - right behind J. Edgar Hoover and Jonah Salk"  He spoke to us then; He speaks to us still. Tom Degan Goshen, NY+music
highly enjoyable+P+I am not a big Tesla fan but this is a great album. I think what hurt them is that they were categorized with the all the goofy hair metal bands but they were more in the vein of your classic 70's style rock and roll band. This live album, along with the accoustic format, helped to distinguish Tesla from the hair metal bands of the era.   Tesla did not do much after this cd so this acts as an excellent greatest hits compilation as well.  Besides their own work, the covers are good and interesting selections. They do not just play "Truckin", rather they segue into it. "Lodi" is done very well and then the song that essentially launched the cd, as well as the band, is "Signs". They take this marginal 60's era protest song and put their stamp of it. It still maintains a protest aura to it but the accoustic treatment makes it grittier and it rocks out harder. Tesla made the song their own!  As far as the accoustic format, the song "Love Song" showcases the musicianship of the band. I like how they could not resist plugging in for the guitar solo.  Overall, you do not have to be a fan of this band to enjoy this cd. If you like any classic rock Led Zep, CCR, Thin Lizzy, Deep Purple, Aerosmith etc. then you will like this.  Like I said, I am not a big fan but b/c of this cd, I would see them live any day!+music
This is why one should never use drugs...+N+...it gives one delusions of grandeur, a sense that any piece of garbage that comes out of one's mouth is a work of genius.  Pure ego.  Pretention.  Stupidity.  Megalomania.  Don't blame them so much -- blame us, we who actually bought anything Lennon and the Beatles put out.  Now, John came out with his BEST solo album Plastic Ono Band soon after this so it's not John's lack of talent.  This is what happens when Cupid strikes you blind...and deaf.  Don't even think of buying this.  I suppose the only good thing about is hearing the heartbeat of an unborn child and realizing that it is, after all, not a glob of tissues but a baby.  So maybe there is some significant "countercultural" message in it, after all+music
Ageless and Beautiful Music+P+It's hard for me to believe that nearly 10 years have passed since this album was released.  Maire Brennan, lead vocalist of Clannad, has a voice that is both ethereal and powerful at the same time.  She has the ability to move me to tears even while singing in a language of which I have only minimal understanding (Irish gaelic).  This particular album has several pieces that are quite beautiful and relaxing ... they would work nicely as lullabies.  Brennan's skill as a harpist is also shown to great advantage on many tracks.  Not to be missed if you are an admirer of Celtic New Age music+music
Can YOU dig it?+P+Iron Butterfly...definately different. There are not too many if any albums with this sound. I used to have this on wax and wanted it on CD now. Great for rap producers if you are creative with samples. True music fans will enjoy+music
Order from Amazon.com directly instead.+P+In the past years I have ordered from individuals via Amazon as opposed to Amazon.com directly.  This time, this particular item was offered through Amazon at basically the same cost and I received the item faster than I ever had before.  From now on if Amazon offers any item I wish to purchase, I'll order it through Amazon directly. +music
Borrrrrring+N+I feel compelled to add my review, as I bought this CD based on what I'd read here...  what a disappointment.  Tedious, predictable, unimaginative "electro-pop".  There's SO much more interesting stuff out there, and I listen to alot. I found this CD remarkably disposable. No offense..+music
A big let down!+N+I bought this CD a while back and it was a complete let down from what I thought it would be.  The commercials made it look so good and made it sound really good.  The commercials depicted at least 45 seconds of good music from the CD, and that is about all I found.  On both CDs combined there are like 2 songs that are OK.  I bought the CD, walked out to my car, popped it in, and listened.  An hour later I got out of my car and took the CD back(or tried to really).  Now the only thing I use the CD for is to watch the little movie clip of the HOT girl on the second CD.  All in all, a big let down+music
good music even if I didn't understand the language.+P+I am not sure if this is the same cd/album that I heard about 10 years ago.  Most often as time goes by an artist will improve with age, getting better as time goes on, learning from beginning mistakes etc. So from this generalization, I believe that he has gotten better. Plan to order this soon+music
Finally one as good as their first+P+I thought that Kutless was getting a little lax in their songwriting skills after "Sea of Faces". This CD shows they've regained their focus on their music. A must-buy for you Kutless fans!!+music
The reason why shred is dead+N+When I was 15 and first discovering guitar, I loved this album. Listening to it now, it just sounds incredibly soulless and cheesy.Vai is technically very impressive, but the man can't write a decent song to save his life. Vai's modus operandi is to get a bunch of faceless studio musicians, lay down a generic rhythm track, and go wheedily wheedily wheedily whee for an entire album.  Technique on your instrument is never a bad thing, however, technique should be just a means to an end, not the end itself. And that's what no shred guitarist seems to understand. The fact that shred guitarists like Vai aren't more popular is due to one thing: they're more concerned about playing faster and more cleanly than the next guy rather than writing songs. There's a GOOD REASON why non-guitarists hate this stuff.  Basically, once you get past the "Gee, that's neat" factor, this album, and nearly all of Vai's music, feels incredibly stiff and lifeless.To be blunt, this is what John Tesh or Yanni would sound like if they played guitar rather than keyboards. Not only that, his guitar tone is absolutely awful. Very thin, high pitched, and brittle sounding.  The best thing on here is the blatant Van Halen rip-off "The Audience is Listening": the rest is just masturbation. Vai's best work has always been as a sideman, especially the stuff he did with David Lee Roth, because then he's forced to play actual SONGS, rather than 5 minute long, tedious guitar solos. On his own, he's just unbearable. I considered giving this one star, but I gave it 2 stars due to the fact that Vai CAN play, it's just WHAT he's playing that's the problem.+music
The Classic Quartet+P+Throughout Coltrane's prolific recording career he performed with many great musicians. One glance at his discography can affirm this fact and this disc features, arguably,  his best surrounding musicians; they have become known as simply  The Classic Quartet. The  featured  aartists are Jimmy Garrison on bass, McCoy Tyner on piano, Elvin Jones on drums  and JC on saxophone(s). If you are a collector of Coltrane music this is a must have disc since it features his classic quartet in fine form. This is a late seminal recording from around the time of  Tranes  album &quot;Ascension.&quot; The title track, &quot;Living Space&quot; is a profound piece and  an inspirational piece of artistry that is emotionally stirring . Trane is featured  playing in his innovative modal mode that was influenced from the timelessness of Eastern Indian music. Since this was a posthumous release there are several tracks that were found that are untitled having only vault numbers. Do not let this put you off since they are some of finest songs on the disc but not having a name to associate with the melody  is a bit challenging for the listener. Trane is at his improvisational best, reaching both vertically and horizontally on his sound, overlapping and interweaving  with staggering results.  The importance of the classic quartet to the totality of the sound cannot be overly emphasized; it was a combustible union that created magic that has lasted for generations. Mccoy Tyner played with a bouyancy that allowed for the shifting of sound  in directions that were held together by the driving drums and pounding of the skins by  Elvin Jones. This coupled with the thumping, harmonic  bass of Jimmy Garrison created the one of tightest groups ever assemled in the annals of jazz history.This disc shows the fluidity of the players, each part contributing to the whole for a sound that has yet to be duplicated.Trane is  bluesy, melodic, at times he plays in a far reaching, writhing style, but eventually the tenderness returns for the  warm lush sound that only he has been able to produce. His ceaseless explorations on the saxophone, exemplified by his quest for a muscial spirtitual search comes through on this fine collection of recordings. Pieces of &quot;A Love Supreme &quot; and fragments of &quot;My Favorite Things&quot; can be heard echoing through the solos of Trane as he explores his inner sanctity revealing his consciousness. This is definitely  a disc for the Coltrane or jazz connoisseur that features some of the last recrdings of the Classic Quartet. An excellent recording by some of the best at their collective apogee+music
auwsome+P+I just ordered this CD and can not wait to get it I have listened to all of the samples and there is not one song that i do not like I believe this guy is going to go very far. I love is song good morning beautiful.  I have always been a very big fan of Vince Gill  now this guy is rating right up there with Vince!!!!!!!!!!!  so thanks for comming to the country scene your going to go very far+music
Where Is &quot;Love Is Alive?&quot;+N+I agree this is not up to par with Joe's best stuff from the 60s and early 70s, but given that, they even left off his best song from this period, &quot;Love Is Alive.&quot;  That song really ROCKS and it is not here.  Shame+music
Sam "Sam" stands alone this time...+P+I've enjoyed all the Winter Solstice collections except the "Winter Solstice on Ice" - now, that's atrocious! No. III is one of my favorites because of the vocals. The version of "In the Bleak Midwinter" is one of the most purely spiritual carols I've ever heard. In fact I'm buying my second copy of this CD today because my first has disappeared+music
Just more schtick+N+I'm getting kind of over the same old schtick all the time. WHy is it that Jews always self depricate? God knows, the Christians never do that. They're very proud all the time. Jews seem to come off "silly" and sophomoric. I suppose this compilation is pretty comprehensive as far as artists, but it sure would be nice if someone put an album together that had a little more heart to it+music
last track: What I Like About Jew+P+For a more modern take on funny Jewish songs, check out What I Like About Jew's CD, titled  Unorthodox , also for sale on Amazon. Sarcastic, hilarious, two very talented New York boys.+music
Excellent Soundtrack+P+This is an excellent soundtrack. PMG show another side of their musical journey with a more atmoshperic and emotionnal journey. If only every soundtrack were this good. One big surprise that I encountered while listenign to this album is the lack of solos, but this lack works really well, the atmosphere is what sings to you on this album unlike previous Metheny albums.  Reccomended to fans of atmospheric and laid-back music. If you're debating on this purchase, buy it right away, you will not regret+music
WOW!+P+I've heard Breeze On By on the radio but I never listened to who the artist was.  This is a great CD - relaxing & romantic music.  Donny still has such a beautiful voice.   BUY this CD - you will not be disappointed in any of the tracks+music
The Best Collection Of 70's Music Out There--Hands Down+P+Instead of giving an individual review of each volume in this series, I decided to give one review on the final volume of the series.   As a child in the 70s I grew up hearing these songs on the radio and the entire series really gave me a feeling of nostalgia. When I started collecting this series, I didn't always know each artist or even each song title, but once I spun the disc, the lyrics to these songs came back from the dark void of my memory. That was half the fun of this whole series. Volume 13 was the one volume in the entire series that I remebered each song. Volumes 12, 13, 14 and 15 are my favorite volumes.   Not each volume is a winner. Volumes 4, and 6 I felt weren't that great of volumes, but each volume contains at least 4-5 great gems. Again, the entire series is great.   This series and Rhino's Didn't It Blow Your Mind series are hands down the best series of 70's music out there. I give both series five stars. If there was one thing that I felt that Rhino missed on these was that they didn't take each series out to five more volumes. The would have given Have A Nice Day 30 volumes and Didn't It Blow Your Mind 25 volumes. Either way, the Have A Nice Day series is my favorite 70s music complilation series and it has gotten lots of use in my CD player.   If you like quirky AM pop from the 70s, then this series is for you. You won't regret it. If your looking for more of the FM style 70s music, then get Time/Lifes Sound of the 70s.   After reading several reviews for the various volumes in this series, it's clear the some people missed the entire point of this series. This entire series was supposed to resemble or be a throw back to those infamous compilation LPs from K-Tel that were everywhere in the 70s. This series wasn't supposed to have great songs. Just memorable ones.+music
Heartbroken more like it...+N+A patched up Free attempts to carry on as normal, but the chemistry is just not there - Fraser is gone and Tetsu struggles / doesn't even try to make the most of the opportunity given to him. Rather than contribute some great bass ideas, he is content just to plod along; Kossoff plays on 5 of the 8 tracks. Gone is the heart wrenching melody and beautiful vibrato of his playing. He's running on remote control. It sounds like he's slumped in the corner of the studio stoned out of his head; Bundrick writes 2 tracks / shares the credits on two others. His work sounds like album filler put there to satisfy the band's contractual requirements. The whole album is Lazarus with a triple bypass.   The only standout track is the EXCELLENT 'Wishing Well'... the other songs are just musical ideas i.e verse and chorus cobbled into a finished song...   another album to buy if you can't stand blank spaces in your Free CD collection... What a tragic waste...+music
Galactic Falls Flat+N+This album in some ways is a perfect antithesis of the quirky, wacky, vivid personality of the first three Galactic studio albums--this is boring, flat and generic. Is that Stanton Moore or a drum machine? Precede straight to Garage a Trois+music
Oh my god, it has taken Patrick Doyle!+N+By "it" I mean the evil monster called "Repetition". It may sound like a strange thing to say, but if you already own Doyle's "Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire", there's absolutely no reason whatsoever to buy this soundtrack.   The film feels like you've seen it a thousand times already, and so does the score. I can't stress enough how much I dislike the habit of many composers to develop a specific sound and a certain set of themes and motifs, and ride them out until the end of days. That being said, it's not a big reach saying that Goblet Of Fire and Eragon sound exactly the same. And they do. The orchestrations couldn't be more identical, and the theme is the same, even if Doyle adds a few flourishes.  It may fit the film somehow, but if you forget that for a second and evaluate the music as an entry in the long history book of film music, or even in the not-so-long book of the last few years, or worse, as a standalone piece, it's just a horrible product, it's Patrick Doyle on autopilot. And even if it does fit the film, there's more to a great film score than capturing a scene reasonably well. A great film score gives the film a unique feeling, and Eragon doesn't do that. Instead of writing an "Eragon" score, Doyle churned out a Patrick Doyle score. Sound crazy, but that's the big difference between good film composers and great film composers.  And contrary to the opinion of many, Doyle is merely a good composer, and so we get a Doyle score with Eragon fingerprints instead of Eragon music with Patrick Doyle fingerprints. +music
Great Jazz Introduction!!!+P+First let me tell you, when I got this cd the only other Jazz I had listened to was Miles Davis and that "West Coast/Cool" style. This Cd opened me up to so much more. I was searching for a cd just of this type that really showcased all the different elements and styles of jazz. While most of this is the vocal type of Jazz(Bille Holiday, Sarah Vaughan, Ella Fitzgerald...) there are the instrumental types of jazz, which up in till this cd I thought was the only type of jazz.   This really opened me up to the Vocal side of jazz, like I may have mentioned before when I purchased this I was a Jazz novice, I had heard Billie Holiday and the like on the radio and Tv/Movies(most of the songs on the cd you will reconize) but never really listened to them. Now I find myself listening to Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong more then any other music(and I listen to a lot of music). I also found a new favorite song of mine, Summertime by Ella and Louis.  I think most of these songs can be found on other cd's so if you already own these artist cd's then you may want to check and see if you don't already own these songs. But if you are new to Jazz like I was, then get this great compilation to start with. Peace Kevi+music
Modern Day Blues Classic+P+This is one of the finest blues albums to be produced in the past 25 years.  Right off the bat from the blistering 'Testify' to the classic 'Mary Had a Little Lamb' to the closing jazz influenced 'Lenny' you know this album is going to be something special.  SRV & TD are found here as a trio and you would be hard pressed to find a tighter band.  This album is a little more striped down and more bluesy then SRV latter works.  This and 'In Sessions' with Albert King are probably Stevie's best blues albums+music
Excellent, legendary show except for Donna the Screech Owl+P+I remember taping this one from the radio on the night that it happened. The Keith & Donna years were a high point for The Dead, but I never really embraced the Donna part of the deal. Here's my challenge to you: listen to "Playing In The Band," and when you get to the point where Donna lets out that prolonged, off-key screech, let me know how that works for you. Donna, in my opinion, was this band's Yoko, except for the fact that Yoko was a better singer. She sort of wandered back and forth across the stage in her white hospital gown and at inappropriate moments let out howls and moans tuneless bursts of God-knows-what-she-was-thinking. Dead Heads have all kinds of reasons why she was a wonderful addition to the band, and I never understood or agreed with any of them. That said, it's a classic and solid set from the band, including Wharf Rat, Help On The Way, Slipknot, Morning Dew and many standards from the 70s era Dead shows. Without Donna, this would be an easy 5-star performance.+music
Shakira Is Terrible+N+I think Shakira sucks a lot.  She can't sing.  I don't understand her musical appeal+music
Big disappointment+N+I've loved some of Shakira's previous songs, and when I heard "Hips Don't Lie", and the fabulous "Don't Bother" (I LOVE those lyrics), I just had to get the album. I put it off for a while, but saw it at a semi-reasonable price, and bought it.  My oh my.   It isn't good!!! The only two standout tracks on the album are the two previously mentioned tracks. I listened it to it twice. Normally I can love an album on first listen, very rarely will I get bored of it on a second listen. Nope, not with this one. Shakira has a lovely voice, but the rest of the tracks are nowhere near as upbeat as "Hips Don't Lie" and "Don't Bother".   Don't bother buying this album unless you are a true, die hard fan of Shakira. Don't waste your money+music
Soul+P+If any country and western singer has soul and depth in his music, it's Buddy Jewell. Smooth and emotionally connecting to all country fans. I believe he is the best new c&amp;w artist in ages and has no where to go but to the top.  I highly recommend this album as fantastic+music
Heavy stuff+P+This is one awesome CD. I bought the Oncoming Storm before this one and I prefer The Stings of Conscience. This CD just plain rocks, heavy. Sweet for head banging, the guitars amaze me, drumming super fast, screaming is solid throughout and nothing is wrong with this CD. Perfect 5 stars. All metalheads must buy this. Fav songs: One Step Away, Stings of Conscience, My Desire. So just buy it already, and get ready to be annihilated+music
Sonic Youth loses their way+N+I remember when this album came out. I had been a huge Sonic Youth fan for years and I ran to Mod Lang in Berkeley to buy it the day it was released. I brought it home, put it on, and desperately tried to like it. But I just couldn't. SY had always had a penchant for strectching out their feedback experiments into sprawling, fasinating compositions, but here it all just seemed to melt down into a pointless noise crusade. There are a few high points, but mostly I just find myself thinking, "there is no way this song deserves to be nine minutes long." The slide continued on the next record, but fortunately they got it together again on "Murry Street" and have been putting out great stuff ever since.+music
IS THERE NO END TO DUKE'S CREATIVITY?+P+Miles Davis once said every one ought to get down on their knees and thank Duke, after listening to this album you'll see why. I am big fan of Duke and the amazing creativity displayed in this album is awesome. There is no bebop, avant guarde, free jazz present just straight ahead swinging crafted beautiful music. The playing is exemplary and does successfully what it set out to do, provide interpretations of Shakespeare characters and plays.   The genius of the man is such that this music can be listened to without references to the Bard's work and is awesome in ever aspect. Melodic , interpetative, improvisational jazz at its best, my only 'problem' is I can't decide which track I like best so I am forced to listen to the music again and again and again and... OH WELL :-)  Buy this album you won't regret. If music be the food of love PLAY (SWING) ON Ellington PLAY ON. Sound familar?? Enjo+music
overrated+N+totally overrated. felt compelled to write a review because everyone else proclaims this release is perfection and the mix of the year.  disc one is strong and on for the first 4 tracks and then becomes totally monotinous and dull until the closing track which is superb. disc two doesn't move me at all except for its classic intro with orbital.  If you are looking for good stuff for your crate seek out the aforementioned on 12" and don't waste your time buying this. +music
An Utter Beauty+P+Gawd, I hope this isn't a forgotten recording. This is Oregon at their early best: unselfconsciousness; innocence; no formula, no regard for sales - just love of musical communication on the most intimate scale. They  understood the value of silence and patience. And Witchi-Tai To ALONE is  worth buying this recording for - it, like precious few recordings, brings  tears to my eyes and makes me glad to be alive and have ears+music
Never received material+N+You shipped it to the wrong address and I never received it!!!+music
Dull music for elderly people, why the 5 stars?+N+I bought this album because I love Charlie Haden's tone, and was impressed by the inclusion of the very fast playing alto saxist Miguel Zenon and pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba in the credits. But why were they hired? There's hardly any need in the bland arrangements for more than competent amateurs. It certainly needs a singer and a rocket up the band. I am so puzzled by the five star reviews that I went back and switched on the CD. The track I picked at random was nice, but I couldn't face a second, and played a Fall record instead to wake me up. I shall try again, but it seems a bit dreary. +music
Can we have a remaster?+P+Of course this is a fine collection. Of course Dizzy's big band in the forties made some fantastic music. Of course this is an indispensible part of jazz history. But oh, the sound...  Previous issues of this music on both CD and vinyl far surpass this one in terms of sound quality. The dreaded nineties-era noise reduction technology is all over this music, taking great hunks of sonic elements away from these vital performances. Since Bluebird corrected similar problems by issuing the Blanton/Webster sides by Duke Ellington, should they not do the same for these great records+music
Seldom have I been this disappointed+N+I have at least half of these Armstrong 78s in my collection, and they are master pressings, not dubs. When played with a proper sized needle and equalized properly as well, they sound many times better than the tracks presented here. This collection is an inconsistent sonic mess. The timbre of the songs changes from track to track, some of the speeds are wrong, the volume levels are all over the place, and the overall listening experience is brash and painful. I don't worry so much about surface noise, and this collection has plenty. But a bigger issue is the way the music has been EQ'd --- in many cases an unnatural bass boost that makes the bottom end sound boxy and muddy, and which consequently makes the already-hyped highs sound even thinner and brasher by comparison. There was obviously no attempt made to properly compensate for the turnover frequencies of the original records, and it's a BIG problem for me. The collection sounds like many contributors sent in material transferred/remastered 'their own way' and the result was just thrown together as a finished product. I was very, very, very disappointed; and feel that the inflated purchase price is not justified.  The hard bound book is nice, but is mostly filled with fancy, decoratively framed pictures and montages; very little real reading. Also, after 2 or 3 'readings', pages began to detach. Extremely cheap manufacture. The CDs had glue all over them, which I had to clean off before they would even play.  There is mention in the notes about 'unauthorized' reissues done previously; I assume they are referring to the John R. T. Davies version on British label JSP, which is sonically FAR superior to this set, and by the way, legal according to European copyright law. Well, if Columbia Legacy could learn how to put out a decent product, people would buy it, and they wouldn't have to present Mr. Davies' excellent work as suspect.  Don't waste your money on this one+music
best starland vocal band cd to date just awesome+P+Starland vocal band cd is just awesome it will blow you away. The harmies they have couldnt better even if you try there awesome vocal talent together is just awesome. a must buy Cd today. George bretzlaf+music
Geek Rock+P+There haven't really been many acts these past few years that really have been more about image than the feeling or uniqueness of great pop music. One of the most surprising acts these past few years is definitely Weezer. They have really brought up a great deal with the feel of geek rock, and their latest single really does connect with everybody. Their latest track Beverly Hills is a great pop song. It is very upbeat and easily catchy. I like this song because it is very different and very vivid. Rivers Cuomo and company have really got a lot into good music right now. Hopefully, they can keep it up with their next single.  Song: B 1/2++music
i call it ..."  EL' CRAPPEO!!!" should bbe 000 stars+N+weezer stinks.  im sooo glad i didnt buy this cd.  its horrible.  my friend has it.  that beverly hills song, is sooo dumb.  he thinks hes all cool and skater and punk singing it.  he sounds emo, and i hate emo.  i hope you agree with me+music
Maybe the best Gangsta rap album ever...+P+Say what you will about the obvious choices of  "The Chronic" and "Doggystyle", my choice will always be Music to Driveby.  This album exemplifies what not only great Gangsta rap should sound like but what good hip-hop should sound like as well.  First and foremost, Eiht is an emcee, not just a rapper.  This performance is the pinacle of his rhyme ability before he became known to the public as "the guy who says geeyah".  He battles ("Dead Men Tell No Lies", "Duck Sick II", "Def Wish II", and "Who's ****ing Who?"), he paints big lyrical hood murals ("Hood Took Me Under" & "Jack Mode"), he constantly reps his hood ("Compton 4 Life"), experiments ("N*ggaz Strugglin" & "U's a B*tch"), and destroys with rapid fire delivery ("Hit the Floor").  He may be the only artist to ever hold his own on a track with the great Brad Jordan a.k.a. Scarface ("N 2 Deep").    Production is cutting edge as well and again.  After the slightly uninspired Staight Checkn'em album, this album returns to the original formula that made It's a Compton Thang so great - creative use of samples.  "Hood Done Took Me Under" is the classic example.  Eiht rips the Isaac Hayes sample used by Easy Mo B for Notorious BIG a few years later for "Warning", and a good decade before Ludacris used it again on his "Chicken & Beer" album.  To top it all off, the loop was vastly superior to either of these uses or numerous others.  Or better yet, check the clever use of scratches and snippets on "Who's ****ing Who?" where Tim Dog's voice is used to scorch himself.  The complete bastardization of BDP's classic "South Bronx" was even a bold manuver with, to my surprise, absolutely no response from Krs-ONE.  And to wrap it all up, you get the smooth instrumental "Music To Driveby" to round it all out.  Yeah sure, Eiht didn't get the national recognition until We Come Strapped a few years later.  But that album, in my opinon, pales in comparison to the overuse of the same production used on Driveby's "Hood Rat" and waaaaaaay to many "Geeyah's".  Driveby's way more diverse in both production and lyrics and does not suffer from any overused topics that Eiht would later be forced to employ from the overabundance of other Gangsta rappers and their albums.  If you're even a mild fan of gangsta rap or even hip hop in general, do yourself a favor and pick up this classic+music
Best I've Heard+P+I purchased several swing collections previously and they all had poor quality audio - they had not been cleaned up from the original recordings.  This CD is MUCH cleaner and makes for an enjoyable experience+music
Brainless Beethoven devaluation+N+What do you get when you play brilliant music through a bad synthesizer? Buy this CD and find out.  Your little prodigy's intellect will be engulfed in an annoying stream of cheap rinky-tink pianos, tooting synth-horns, and  fake accordions.  This is a cheap and annoying version of a great  composer's work. Your young Einstein would be better off with a cheap  harmonica+music
Evil Is A Spirit+P+I was alone and in the dark when horror seeped from my speakers into my imagination. At the end of a long metal corridor is Sunn O))), a large dark orb of pain, hate and the fear of every paralyzing dream. Its core spins violently like a tempest of knives but its movement toward me is slow, deliberate & inevitablelike the Ocean or Time or God Himself...  Evil in metal is increasingly difficult to represent convincingly.  Sunn O))) remind us that evil is not tangible, its corporal.  Its not a flesh eating pit fiend or something pictured on a Dio cover.  Evil is a Spirit and as a spirit is something bigger than our comprehension, and thus, our ability to stop it. Therein lies its terror. There is no escape or defense from an omnipotent foe; one not bound by physics like life in a tangible form.    As such, Sunn O))) do not create Dungeons & Dragons heavy metal.  Its closer to ambient music using minor keys and the sustain on a downtuned bass instead of marimbas and wind chimes. It owes as much to Terry Riley as Toni Iommi. Verbs like "lumber" and "plod" used for past doom acts don't apply here either.  Sunn O))) hover, glide or even wisp. Omnipresent yet invisible, you'd be no more sure it was there if you could see it.   Black One is truely terrifying music.  It is quite possibly my most terrifying experience ever observing art.  It's reward is profound if you have the...Spirit for it+music
Peter and the Wolf+P+I gave this to my grandson, who loves the music of Peter and the Wolf.  He is 2 years old, and from what his mother says, he loves it+music
Great for Kids and Adults+P+My 3 yr old got this for Christmas and absolutely loves it.  We dance to it all the time.  I went to workout the other day to find it was in player instead of my normal workout CD...and already into my workout decided to keep going.  It was GREAT to workout to.  Very energetic like the show and good for variety in my workout.  I may have to get a second one for me!+music
I can't believe it!  A new Free Design CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!+P+The music of the Free Design was a part of the fabric of my life in the late 60's/early 70's.  The intricate harmonies and intimate feelings shared by this family somehow cut through the psychedelic pomposities of the time and did what my favorite music always does:  IT MAKES YOU FEEL GREAT! To possess a new CD by the FD in the new millenium is nothing short of a miracle.  The sound is unchanged:  the layered vocals, the floating interjections of flute and recorder, the challenging compositions of Chris Dedrick are all intact.  Missing in action is the beguiling voice of Ellen, although co-producer Rebecca Pellet deputizes well for her.  Bruce's pipes are a bit rustier than before, but Chris' delight in recollaborating with his brother is evident. It's so grand to hear music this honest, without a hint of gadgetry or synthesizer.  Track 7, &quot;The Hook&quot;, makes a sly dig at the triumph of machine over man in today's pop scene.......it's the &quot;cute&quot; tune of the set.  Standout songs include the title tune and &quot;McCarran Airport&quot;, kind of a &quot;Leaving on a Jet Plane&quot; for the 2000s. If you like the Free Design at all, you should be enjoying this CD as soon as possible without compunction. If you are unfamiliar with the group, order the &quot;Best Of&quot; or the too-expensive Japanese issue of &quot;You Could Be Born Again&quot; along with &quot;Cosmic Peekaboo&quot;.........you won't be sorry. If all Free Design fans purchase the new set, maybe we'll  persuade the Dedricks to continue their excellence with further new recordings.  I certainly hope so.  Music like this is too precious to take for granted+music
I HAVE SONG WHEN OLIVIA KISSES REAL SEBASTIAN+N+the song is called "love" by matt white and i had a hard time finding it too but it's because his cd doesnt come out until feb 2007. he has a myspace and the song was also in the movie little manhatta+music
Romantic tunes+P+This is a nice CD to bring back more soothing and romantic music.  Wanted a more diverse collection to add to my currect CDs. +music
Nostalgic Kitsch on a Theme of Guaraldi+N+...or, how to make a quick buck on someone elses stuff. Or, to summarize with a trite phrase, &quot;Can't Beat the Real Thing&quot;.  The legendary Guaraldi wrote jazz that is akin to American culture, and is loved by all. This translation takes something that was perfect and takes it down the other side of the peak. Isn't it enough to enjoy the original works without embellishing it with some popular anecdotes?  Would you buy Steely Dan from anyone but Fagen?  It just misses the mark, and screws up a good thing+music
Oldies Lover+N+There are a lot of songs on this CD that I don't remember & don't really care for.  However, the sound quality is good.  Take the time to listen to all the samples before buying+music
A must have for your jazz collection...+P+...this one.  The definitive first half of the Basie &quot;Old Testament Band&quot; studio catalogue.  Good-quality sound, for the era, as well as excellent remastering of the source material.  These versions of these songs are what took Basie from a mid-western regional band status to national prominence.  Better material than the 3 discs extant comprising most of the second half of the &quot;Old Testament&quot; studio catalogue (&quot;Essential&quot; series, V.1-3 from Columbia Records), as well (if one must choose).  I give this one 6 stars from a strictly swing-era only perspective+music
some of triphop's finest+P+Becoming X is great to listen to in almost any situation like get togethers, hanging around the house or whatever. 6 Underground definately helps make the album and the two versions of the song are fabulous+music
A good but imperfect companion volume to "Greatest Hits"+P+Stevie Ray Vaughan's original Greatest Hits album was far too short at just 11 not particularly well chosen tracks, but this 1999 addition goes a long way towards making up for that. It is not a hits package per se, since most of these songs were never released as singles, but it features lots of excellent songs like "Willie The Wimp", "Ain't Gone 'N' Give Up On Love", "Empty Arms", and Vaughan's magnificent rendition of Doyle Bramhall's acoustic survivor story "Life By The Drop".  That still doesn't make it a definitive career retrospective, though, even when coupled with "Greatest Hits" vol. I, and the inclusion of tunes like "Pipeline" and "Superstition" is suspect considering what has been left out. At 27 songs, these two albums are trumped by the superb double-disc collection "The Essential Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble", which is cheaper than "Greatest Hits" vol. I and II together, yet features a stronger selection of songs, and six more of them as well+music
UNA PORQUERIA, IN ENGLISH THAT MEANS....+N+Well, I read a few reviews, listened to the samples here on Amazon, and bought the cd. My God! Awful isnt word enough to describe this. Ok, the songs alone are ok, but when you listen to the whole cd, is when you realize that those guys doesnt know many chords, and that all the songs sound the same (a few variations), and that the vocals ARE all the same, well, you have a patetic album. Very weak, very boring, nothing new.  They could do better, the lyrics are ok, but they need help, like, music lessons, even better, composition lessons. Is really bad when all the songs in your album are identical. My fellow metalheads, rockers, whatever name you want, DO NOT buy this, get a friend to loan it to you, then if you still want it, well, is your $$.  But if you want real music, get Death,  or Rush, hey, even Green Day is better option. In the end, High on Fire should be left for begginers in the metal world of music.+music
Underrated hiphop, almost a classic..........+P+Latifah had all the qualities of a great female MC (flow, beats and them juggs). My personal favorite joint from her.  Top Tracks: The Pros King and Queen Creation Come to Me Ladies First Latifah's Law Inside Ou+music
I'd Rather Listen To Hilary Duff+N+Review by Cory Rennison:  Major labels never cease to amaze me with their abilities to find the most generic bands out there and sign them. The kind folks over at Maverick Records have put out a new addition to the ongoing borefest that is mainstream music and their name is Stutterfly.  Stutterfly has thrown together 13 tracks of power chords, angst-ridden lyrics, and song titles that are laughable at best. Some things that did work for this band were the great sounding vocals, and the rare occasions on the disc when the band attempted to have some actual guitar riffs instead of power chords. There isn't really a whole lot of singing in metal these days, so it was kind of interesting hearing it on this CD, however instrumentally, there's just nothing special here.  With only a few key moments here and there, which are easily forgotten anyways, there's really no reason to waste your time or money on this album. Chances are I'll forget this band's name by next week+music
Shoulds be called 0/20+N+This is just absolutely terrible from beginning to end. I'm so sick of these underground d---riders giving this 5 stars. This is garbage. I'd much rather listen to a good commercial rap album than this garbage. The lyrics are boring and wack, the production is bad, and the concepts are stupid. I'm gonna go pick up Cam'Ron's new album "Killa Season" next week and I suggest you go do the same. For good west coast rap, wait for Ice Cube's new album that comes out June 6th. This is one of the year's worst albums+music
Shere Kahn at his finest.+P+People who listen to Andre Nickatina either love him or hate him.  I love him.  Cant get enough.  Horns and Halos is one of the best.  Andre's lyrics are random and usually make no sense, but I just love the way it sounds.  the beats are addictive, just like his drug habbit+music
Elvis - 2nd to none CD = BAD+N+I ordered "Elvis - 30 #1 Hits" and this CD was fine. Along with that order, I ordered "Elvis 2nd to None".    The CD case was damaged, and the actual CD contained songs in it that were damaged...  Unfortunately it was a gift that I gave someone in another state, which makes it too complicated to return..+music
Give me the first two records instead...+N+Okay, some of this is awesome: the ballads Ain't Gone 'n' Give Up on Love and Life Without You are the best; Change It is a great blues-rocker, and his guitar livens up even weaker material like Say What! and Come On, pt. 3. Still, this is a thin album overall. Lookin' Out the Window; Look at Little Sister; You'll Be Mine and Empty Arms are among Stevie's worst. Stick to the first two records instead, plus maybe In Step.+music
What a CD!!!+P+This selection is an absolte great one.  It is great for parties and just to scare the bejesus out of people.  It is not, I dare say, one that you would want to listen to over and over again.  It repeats itself in many tracks, but for fun, you've got to have this one+music
my Favorite boxset+P+first off, to all the people who wrote in and said the dvd is not good WHAT DID YOU EXPECT? THE HOLY GRAIL IN THE FORM OF A DVD? THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST PERFORMANCES I'VE SEEN & HEARD.  granted jonas does not look terribly happy to be there, but he sounded great. while i, too, got all the studio albums the day they came out i had to get this collection (mainly for the dvd...which does not dissapoint)but also for the unreleased songs...nothing about this set let me down (although i would like to have seen an interview or video on the dvd).  FOR ANY FAN OF KATATONIA-DON'T MISS OUT. a lot of it is redundant, but the rest is fantastic+music
THE place to start your Monk collection+P+A great remastered version of one of Monks' masterpiece recordings. Every selection here offers something unexpected and the entire CD swings like crazy. Monks comping on the title track Criss Cross behind Charlie Rouses's temor is something to behold. he is never where you think he's going and yet melodic and perfectly in the tune. This guy was really something special and this CD offers a chance to hear him at his peak. Buy it..you can't go wrong here+music
Bouncin' tribute!+P+"Oh, My NOLA" is a tribute to the Crescent City by native Harry Connick Jr.  He grew up playing with jazz greats in the small clubs on Burbon Street, and this album feels like it came from there.  Every song sings and dances almost on its own, and jazz-lovers from long ago will remember hits like "Jambalaya (on the Bayou)," "Careless Love," "Won't You Come Home, Bill Bailey?" and "Lazy Bones" (with spectacular trombone playing by Lucien Barbarin.)  My kids love this one, and we stop everything to sing together on "The Sheik of Araby."  The title song, a Connick composition, says it all.  This album is a tribute to the heritage of New Orleans, and to the musical tradition that is kept alive by recordings like these.

Porcupine Tree Rocks!+P+This is one of the most innovative, talented bands that's come along in a while! If you like Dream Theater, Rush or Queensryche you'll love these guys! Also, check out their newer albums Deadwing & In Absentia! Absolutely brilliant+music
Gotta be honest+N+I've been a Bone fan for 12 years and Bizzy's first 3 solos are classics in my opinion. However, all of the fears that Speaking In Tongues brought to my mind were confirmed by this release. I still think that Bizzy's a uniquely talented and spiritual man, but he seems to have surrounded himself with wack producers and low expectations.  The repetative hooks and sparse verses are particularly disappointing+music
A Disappointment :(+N+Having listened to one of the hottest Balance releases (Desyn Masiello Balance 08), I had high expectations from the follow up release (Paolo Mojo Balance 09). Unfortunately, they are completely opposites when it comes to my listening enjoyment. The tracks in Paolo's compilation are nothing but outdated. I can't wait for Jimmy Van M's release of Balance 10 to erase the bad memories of Paolo's buzz kill.  +music
This is a farce, part one+N+By 1976, somebody had the rather strange idea of tearing apart the Australian version of "HIGH VOLTAGE" and "T.N.T", AC/DC's first two albums, and then sew some of the pieces together into this hodgepodge. Who's to blame for this rip off?. Somebody at Atlantic Records?. Some members of AC/DC?. Maybe both?. Who cares anyway?.  Certainly the late Bon Scott, a man who never minced words, was not particularly delirious about this idea. As he bitterly screamed in the title track of "DIRTY DEEDS DONE DIRT CHEAP": "Neck ties, contracts, high voltage, done dirt cheap!". Now that I've got used to the Aussie albums, listening back to this "product" feels worse than a hangover from consuming adulterated, low quality spirits. Even the front cover is ridiculous. Perhaps those who conceived it intended to capture Angus Young's manic frenzy on stage. But the result is hilarious: a picture of Angus Young looking like a retard holding an obviously fake, broken Gibson SG. A real broken guitar would have saved the day (just a little bit). Every enthusiastic record collector knows that both Atlantic records (now Warner Music) and Epic records (now Sony Music) are serious labels that took, and still take risks, by signing up cutting edge artists and by respecting their will. So, it seems that, with their approval of this re-issue, the surviving members of AC/DC are the ones to blame for this farce to go on, and on, and on ... If this is so ... well ... guys, we, the fans, made you filthy rich. We deserve the "real deals", available worldwide, at a "reasonable price". A final word about this re-issue: I don't own it. In the words of Pete Townshend, I "won't get fooled again". Alas, there are no bonus tracks, nor previously unreleased material. For reasons unknown to me, the surviving members of AC/DC seem quite apprehensive about sharing a bit more of their music with us (both Warner Music and Sony Music are reissuing classic albums with tons of bonus/previously unreleased material). If Bon Scott (undisputedly the band's most uncompromising member ever), was still alive, I believe things would be different. By the way, if you are interested in the real stuff, please be so kind as to read my review of ".T.N.T. (Import)". OTHER ITEMS TO BE AVOIDED: The skimpy "retrospective" EP "'74 JAIBREAK", and "BONFIRE", a rather steep box set in which at least 6 songs are repeated twice, in different versions. None of these titles include all the songs left out by the adulteration of AC/DC's first four Aussie albums+music
talking about the car wash+P+rose royce was tight my faves are wishing on a star, and love don't live here anymore and can't forget the classic I'm goin down remade by mary j blige, ynv, and more recently camron ooh boy. and can't forget the ghetto classic car wash you ain't ghetto til you jammed off that cut so if you feeling rose royce you should get this and keep daddy rich's memory alive+music
Rhino Stumbles+N+I really expected more. Rhino, the author of the Stiff Records and 'Left of the Dial' box sets and the 'Just Can't Get Enough' series assembled this tired set of eighties new wave? Wow.  A third of this CD has been anthologized to death. Toni Basil? Men Without Hats? A-Ha? Modern English? Thomas Dolby? Dexy's Midnight Runners? Again??? Where's Nena and "99 Luftballoons"?   I could name six more interesting choices in my sleep: Pete Shelley. Freur. Lene Lovich. Heaven 17. Fun Boy Three. Blancmange.   Gary Numan, Haircut 100 and Frank & Moon Zappa lend a breath of fresh air, and Rhino does their usual stellar job of remastering, but it's not enough.  This is for the person who: A. is an extremely casual music fan (i.e. buys a CD about every other year), or B. is too young to have been around when these songs were all over the airwaves.  Otherwise, you likely have the better stuff on this CD elsewhere, and who needs to hear "Mickey" ever again? (And I mean EVER again.) If you fit one of the two profiles listed above, you'll be completely content. If you don't--save your money.    +music
A magnificent cd from one of the best groups+P+Proably one of the best cd Queen has did since, A Night At Opera. That and also knowing the fact that this would be Queen's last cd together. I mean, words can't begin to describe how good this cd is. Inneundo is like one musical painting. With songs like "Deliah, Bijou" and the title track itself, "Innuendo" that just inspire the imagination and the soul. But, it also has some very moving tracks too, "The Show Must Go On" and "These are the days of our lives". That are so wonderful. Innuendo is a great cd and is most defantly worth listening to.+music
Would've been  5 stars if it wasn't for the Outlaws+P+Look, it's not that I don't like The Outlaws,in fact I have much respect for them for bein loyal and true to Pac , but to be quite honest,lyricly, they might be the worst group of rappers Iv'e ever heard in my life.The fact that this album went Double Platinum tells you everything you need to know about 2Pac's popularity more then anything else. Okay Hussein Fatal(who for some reason isn't even on the album) was cool and Kadafi(R.I.P.) was okay, but the rest of them,at best, were a little below average.I can't tell you how many Pac songs they've brought down because of their obvious lack of lyrical talent.     With that being said, I really do think that this was a good album. The stand out tracks for me are "Mr.President", "Secrets Of War"(Pac comes off nice on this one.He also has an unreleased verse on this song), "Homeboys", "The Good Die Young", "killuminati", "Hell For A Hustler","Baby Don't Cry" and "Tattoo Tears". My favarite song on this album has to be "Hell For A Hustler". Pac's rage and emotion on this song is unbelieveble.      "Whatching over me threw every murder scene"    "Guess you can call me anti-social,n****z shaken like they caught the holy ghost when I approach you".      Bottom line,if your a fan of 2Pac then you should probably snatch this album up because Pac's lyrics on this album alone is worth the price even though he's only rapping on 1-2 verses per song.    +music
Tonight is right for Love (With Meredith Baxter-Birney)+P+Chef Aid is worth the buy.  This very funny record includes &quot;live&quot; intros to each song by Chef, not to mention a selection of his greatest hits, like the title above my review, which he performs with  Meatloaf.  Cartman and the gang join the fun as well, along with Ned,  Primus, Rick James w/ Ike Turner, Rancid, Wyclef, Devo, and Elton John?   Buy Chef Aid and play it with someone you love+music
Trent is the man!+P+Not surprisingly t-rez comes up wit another great sounding album.  I swear the only way to listen to this is LOUD very very LOUD! its very noisy but great at the same time cant wait for pt.2 but i think its going to be a movie, who knows+music
Wakes you up instead+N+This CD was supposed to be soft, easy music that would help you go to sleep.  I did go to sleep almost immediately but not because of the music--I was just very tired.  However, the music actually woke me up a couple of times when it got just a little louder.  Maybe it's me, but I didn't find this product to do as promised. +music
Lorraine Hunt Lieberson Sings Peter Lieberson: Naruda +N+Great voice, totally uninteresting music. For me, not accessible. Not lyrical enough. Almost funereal. My musical 'horizons' apparently are not broad enough for this one+music
Way ahead of it's time+P+If you need a quick introduction to Amon Duul II this is the album for you .The album showcases Amon Duul at their best and with the best line up and with a great set of songs.Other Amon Duul II albums have long tracks and improvisations that take a while to get into .This is one of my favorite albums of all time .The live Version of Archangels Thunderbird is just awesom+music
Unoriginal, cheap tricks.  More like talent show.+N+Blast is a very well-coordinated show, as it is suposed to be.  It employs a variety of different themes, instruments, and atmostphere, unlike, say, Stomp.  But Blast does not feel like a theatrical piece.  The majority of the show cold be played during a highschool football halftime or at an amusement park and could be well-recieved, but not in a theater.  Where the producers do attempt to showcase some artistic originality, they fail quite miserably.  Performers are enthusiastic, but they just don't deliver the absorbing, fascinating dynamics that, for example, Stomp does+music
$15 is about right+N+I have no idea whether Mr. Spector is guilty of the serious charges against him, but he stands convicted of allowing his retrospective box to be released with some of the muddiest, dullest mastering in memory. Sound-wise, a total mess. Of course, many of the tracks are indispensable.+music

What's so freakin' great about this?+N+I hate AC/DC, them and Metallica are extremely overrated in the metal department.  As musicians, these guys are very average AT BEST, most of the time, they're below average.  It doesn't matter if it's Bon Scott or Brian Johnson singing for them, AC/DC has always sucked.  Unlike other metal bands like Slayer and Sepultura, AC/DC's songs are very cheesy and boring, the only thing this is good for is the whiff of nostalgia.  Want real 80's metal (not glam)?  Go for Slayer, Sepultura, Kreator, Exodus, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Mercyful Fate, Hellhammer and many others+music
Bach, Moog, and Carlos+P+There's very little enjoyable as seeing the Brandenburg's put on by a live group of musicians.  Switched-On is the antithesis of that experience: a work completed in the studio with extensive dubbing.  Yet, hearing this again, after so many years, is a reminder of Bob Moog's analog synthesizer and Wendy Carlos' comprehensive application.  Carlos did not show how to compose for the synthesizer, the way Stockhausen and Subotnick had.  This was exclusively a study in tone-shaping and arranging for synthesizer.  Bach, an organ master, would have been the first person to test-drive Moog's creations had he been alive.  Analog synths sound more organic than digital ones, and Moog's are distinctive even in that category.  [If you are looking for Carlos' interpretation of Beethoven's 9th, for A Clockwork Orange, that music is unfortunately not included in this set.+music
Bottom of the heap+N+This album is seriously bland.  Smulch in spoonfulls.  I can't understand how JT's record label would allow him to release music so lacking in any spirit whatsover.  God only knows what encoraged me to buty it.  My advice to you is keep well away+music
Where is the ICE CUBE I know ?+N+What happened ?  Ice Cube is my favorite rapper of all time!  For anyone else this would have been 3 stars, but this is a real disappointment to me persoanlly.  If you like the older HARD hitting Ice Cube and NWA I would try one of his earlier releases.  Who knows though... I love plenty of CDs that I hated at first+music
Colonel Abrams is Major!!!!!+P+The Best of Colonel Abrams is a bright collection of the artist's dance classics and quiet storm masterpieces.  With the CD opener "Specutlation" you have a good sense of what is about to come. With such hits and Garage classics like "Trapped", "I'm not gonna let" and "How soon we forget" this makes the CD one of the best dance artist collections thus far.  The Best of also covers some of the quiet storms recording such as " Marquex" and "Table for two" with is also worth listening too and shows the diversity of the artist. Many listeners may say "Hey he sounds like Teddy Pendergrass!" but trust me he has a style and voice all his own.  Trust me this is also a must have and you will get your moneys worth.  Buy it!!+music
A Fine Album Made Better +P+There is an eerie haunting sound to this 4rd album from The Band..the production is noticeably slicker, funky horns,the songs juxtapose upon each other unlike the thematic soundscapes found on their 3 prior efforts. If their first album, Music From Big Pink was the soul, their 2nd,The Band, the heart, their 3rd, Stage Fright,raw emotion, then Cahoots is the mind..these well crafted produced songs featuring the likes of New Orleans legend A. Touissant, a great belting Van Morrison, all add to a fine album worthy of being part of any one's collection..As a matter of fact, 2 great Band classics, their stellar version of Dylan's troubadour gypsy classic "When I Paint My Masterpiece" and the funky "Life Is A Carnival" are well worth the 5 stars allotted this review. The eerie vocal mixes throughout, a group somewhat not sounding comfortable but in Cahoots with it all..poised for stardom and somehow throwing it all away in their persistence of authenticity is a theme felt throughout these tracks...the strained guitar chords of Robbie Robertson, the pain found in Danko's and Manuel's singing, the ever present exuberance of the highs and lows found in Levon Helm's voice and the keyboard wizardry of that mad tinkerer Garth Hudson all add to an album hard to find the likes of nowadays. The Band gels and manage to shine in the right places. The extra tracks are all stellar,Endless Highway,Bessie smith,Don't Do It..        +music
Skip it and get a real Muddy Water or Howlin' Wolf CD+N+When I was buying this, I did not know much about Muddy's or Wolf's discography, and I didn't bother reading any reviews.  In fact, I first thought it might be Muddy's own original CD called "Muddy and the Wolf" for some strange reason.  It isn't.  Half of this CD is Muddy Waters, and the other half is Howlin' Wolf.  This is not a collaboration either.  This is SOME of the material taken from Muddy's highly acclaimed Fathers and Sons CD and SOME of the material taken from Wolf's London Sessions and basically glued together into one incomplete disc.  If you think you want a *sample* of either man's style, this is probably a bad place to start because it only represents Muddy late in his career doing electrical blues and Wolf in a once-in-a-lifetime collaboration with the British rockers in London.  Not a typical sample of each man's career at all.  I do own Wolf's London Sessions and find them interesting material, but they are not by any means a true representation of the bluesman that Wolf was.  As for Muddy, you'd do much better just getting his Fathers and Sons CD.  Save your money here+music
Oh Come ON!+N+Good old Brad Mehldau has once again shown that he can take any pleasant little tune and turn it into something ugly enough to have made Alban Berg wince.  This is the kind of stuff that poseurs love to intellectualize about but no one actually wants to listen to.  If Bill Evans had been immature, ignorant and narcissistic he would have been Brad Mehldau.  Don't waste your money+music
Excellent+P+This album is probably Mana's finest work. This is basically the last album they did before they went overly pop-oriented. The album art is simple, just the band with their instruments. While other albums try to catch your eye with flashy cover art, this album may go unnoticed. However, there isn't a bad song on this disc, and it is worth every penny. The songs range from love songs, to songs about difficult life circumstances, and all the songs are sung with incredible raw emotion. The music is great, and it goes with the lyrics and voice perfectly.  This is the album that shows everything Mana is capable of. Incredible+music
And this is the message from the Ruler Rick crew+P+This Cd is a classic. To this day (as was the case at a cousin's wedding reception recently in Charlotte, NC), the likes of "Children's Story" and "The Moment I Feared" can still pack dance floors nearly 20 years later.  Overall, this is one of the best rap Cds of all time. Ricky "Slick Rick" Walters was/is the UNCROWNED KING (well, since he was also known as "Rick the Ruler", maybe he WAS crowned) of rap storytelling. This is one of the few rap Cds that are as much fun to listen to as well as dance from. He was a brilliant, creative, and imaginative lyricist and rhymester with his unique style, and no two songs on this Cd are lyrically or musically alike. He was one of the few who took full advantage of the format of rap to tell some really interesting stories that took listeners to another level.  The one downnote is that Rick sends some really mixed messages here. While "Children's Story" and the lovely "Hey Young World" as well as "Teenage Love" has our hero laying down some pretty positive stuff for his younger fans, there's also the negativity and misogyny of "Treat Her Like a Prostitute","Indian Girl," and "Lick The (you get the idea)" that foreshadowed the lows that NWA and future rappers would take along this dark line. In another ugly sign of things to come, Rick's publicized imprisonment (from a case eerily similar to "Children's Story")stifled his future output and stalled a great career (as would be the case with many future, albeit less talented, rappers)  It would be nice if he were to record with his onetime partner and fellow storyteller Dana Dane of the unrecorded Kangol Krew of the early 80s. Now THAT would be an amazing record (they appeared together only once in recent years to my knowledge in a film perfroming with Rick's later partner Doug E. Fresh).  But we can be thankful for what's here and enjoy it for what it is. The title fits. Good night+music
AWESOME!!!+P+once again Wynton and the LCJO come through with a magnificent performance+music
He's the Wolf+P+This is not a very tough choice, if you like Howlin' Wolf or the blues get this box. It has not weak tracks, some fascinating interviews (well The Wolf talking), and many of the classic, indispensable tracks.Plus, there's, as evidenced here, no other electric blues guitarist nearly as nasty, dirty, just downright awesome as Hubert Sumlin. Buy and enjoy, this is the blues at its best+music
HERES HOW TO MEET THE BEATLES.....+P+If not for "The Blue Album" I would have probably never became a fan of The Beatles. Back in the day-day they had virtually no influence on me whatsoever. I knew many a song from the old days of Beatle-mania, I wanna hold your hand type of stuff. I wasn't terribly impressed. Than one day I was introduced to SGT. PEPPER and ABBEY ROAD thru a friend, and I realized that there actually was a reason why The Beatles are so legendary. In my book the years 1967-1970 are the better Beatle years. More experimental, less poppish, and more.... waaaaaaaavy maaaaaan. More ROCKIN' to say the least. The red and blue albums are perfect starter packs for The Beatles. Someone managed to pick just the right songs to put on both collections. (RED is for the Beatle-maniacs, and BLUE is for the acid eating Beatle-maniacs) both were mixed just right. Sure you don't get everything, but there is far too much to ask for. You get the full versions of the stuff that you are bound to know, and if not will take to quickly and both sets are quality hits packages.  I remember when I was around 14 and decided I was gonna get myself a Beatles record. I wasn't sure exactly what I wanted at first.. but one look at the track list on here, and I knew I wanted this one. I chose correctly.  The best Beatles hits pack available.+music
Leaves You Motionless While Your Mind Races Out Of Control!!+P+If you've listened to enough trance mixes you may already be familiar with BT. For example: BT's Godspeed and Dreaming are featured in some of Dj Micro's mixes ( Dj Mixed & Micro-Tech Mix 2.0 ). If you can recall, these tracks have been more than entrancing. This CD contains the whole package including those two amazing tracks and the other featured tracks in this mix is incredible! It is difficult to make a decision off the bat whether or not to get this CD since Amazon doesn't have a preview feature. But trust me, I took the plunge based on the reviews alone and I couldn't have been more pleased.  Here is a breakdown of some tracks on the CD:   1.) Movement In Still Life - This track is the intro to the CD and starts off with a skit phone call, with some guy (who sounds like some beat junky) talking, saying he wants to make some fresh hits. It's funny because he says to call him back @ his mom's house and if he's at his grandmas, call his pager. As cheezy as this sounds Track 1 quickly transitions into some hard hitting beats with a nice Urban B-Boy feel to it. 10/10   6.) Dreaming - This is a nice track. It starts out a little slow and gradually brings you back up to speed. This track features vocals by Kristy Hawkshaw whos voice is very soothing. Some insight to some of the lyrics included in the chorus are: "No words no talk, We'll go Dreaming; No Pain no hurt, We'll go Dreaming." Near the end of track the vocals reverb and fade into some motivating beats. 9/10   7.) Giving Up The Ghost - This track follows the previous track almost by suit and carries the same trance beat with some new sounds and synthesizers. Since this CD is a continous mix, I believe this track was included to support the next selection. Whether or not that's fact, the transition between these two tracks ( 7 & 8 ) are very tasteful. 8/10   8.) Godspeed - Here is where you want to turn up the volume, adjust your highs and lows, turn the bass down a few notches so the deep base on this track doesn't drown out the inspirational feel. As this track spins above the lasers of your CD player, the ground beneath you feet seems to vanish and leave you in suspense. The enticing female vocal quivers elate your senses and unexpected booms and repercussions of the base send you freefalling, landing within the tides of machine beats sending you to a far away corner of your brain so you can TRANCE OUT. I give this one an amazing 10/10.  10.) Running Down the Way Up - This is one of my favorite selections. This track starts out with an acoustic guitar interlude for about 20-30 seconds, then some attractive female vocals come to the forefront. The vocals really set the scene and are heard throughout the the entire track. What makes these vocals all the more appealing, the begining vocals are whiped with exotic reverbs and channel mixing which make this track what some refer to as "ear candy". Then the excitement ends with impressive electric guitar rifts and licks. I classify this one a 10/10+music
Worse than a bad recording+N+Pros: They sing well.  Cons: None of the carols are complete. They draw you in with a little teaser, tack on a big finale, then dash on to the next just as you start responding.  Worse, the tracks bleed into one another, so randomizing playback sounds just awful.   I'd love to have a recording of unabridged Christmas carols with this caliber of musicality, but can't recommend this cd+music
Solid, though a litle monotonous at times (3.5 estrellas)+P+The songwriting on this album is really good, the level of musical ability of the band is high, and the hits are solid.  The album comes out of the gate with a bang due to the single "Puedes Contar Conmigo".  I think our local pop station here in Atlanta has overplayed "Rosas", but it is a classic.  Amaia has a sweet and alluring voice, however a whole album of it will tire you out.  This is not something you will want to listen to from beginning to end.  I would suggest they let other band members sing 2 or 3 of the songs on their next album to break the monotony.  Amaia can sing and definitely should lead the singing (plus she is a good songwriter), though.  Perhaps this is why Julieta Venegas' albums are short - to keep her fans from tiring of her distinct, recognizable voice.  This album proves why they are a supergroup with enormous popularity.  Its worth spending the money to buy the album, but one must strongly consider buying las canciones individuales if they are not a major fan+music
Yes it is swampy honky tonk, but also deep soul food +P+Add James Luther Dickinson to the pile of producer/artists whose influence is vast but whose recognition, except with cognoscenti, is minimal. He is in august company, and runs a North Mississippi/Memphis recording studio on par with Cowboy Jack Clements's outside Nashville.  With the revival of attention in southern roots music prompted by the best selling "O Brother Where Art Thou?" soundtrack and live recording, it is surprising Dickinson's own contribution, now available on CD, is overlooked. For with this album Dickinson gives a voice more authentic than a mere preservationist. This is far beyond the earliest Dickinson sounds from the Sun-influenced "The Goat Dancers" period. Indeed, the guitar solo on "Wine" is a fabulous execution worthy of Junior Brown, while the jackhammer piano is full-on honky-tonk, and if it were not for Dickinson's bulk you'd think the Killer himself had kicked over the piano stool to rip it out. The drums can barely keep up, and the wet voices of backup singers already sneak in notes they will scream horizontally in the after show entertainment. And this is only the first cut on the album, not the best cut on the album.  There are, perhaps, certain points of comparison with early recordings of "Little Feat," to which this reviewer can only respond: they stole it all from Dickinson+music
LACKLUSTER GREATEST HITS+N+The exclusion of one of Reba's TRUE greatest Hits "Till You Love Me" and the inclusion of such wretched tunes as "Why Haven't I Heard from You" and "One Honest Heart" makes me want to just cry.  This is a lackluster greatest hits album not noteworthy by any means. +music
Pointless+N+This album is a mess.  It bounces around and resembles a long warm up.  It does not seem to have a direction as it bounces around between a lot of different types of music and never finds a home with any of them+music
Manheim Steamroller's American Spirit+P+Another excellent CD I'd recommend to all ages, even us oldsters!+music
Not what I think of when I think Manheim Steamroller+N+This wasn't a bad CD, but it was NOT what you typically think of when you think of Manheim Steamroller music.  I was expecting electronica patriotic music.  I got a kinda old trucker country sort of music.  No wonder it's so cheap compared to the other MS cds..+music
Enough of this Broadway vs London stuff. Let's add Australia to the picture+P+Like most people, I've been torn between London and Broadway for a while. I'll admit, I'm fond of both London and Broadway, but some songs I like on Broadway more than London, and vice versa. However, when I bought the Australian recording, it turned into my favorite CATS recording, hands down. They have EVERY song in there, (Growltiger's Last Stand, and Battle of the Pekes and Pollicles) Anyhow, here's my biased opinion on which of the three recordings dominate in certain songs.   Overture - The overture is pretty much the same  Jellicle Song for Jellicle Cats - London   Naming of Cats - Australia  Invitation to the Jellicle Ball - Broadway  Old Gumbie Cat - London but Australia's is pretty darn good   Rum Tum Tugger - I'm not very fond of London's version or Broadway's. I'd have to say Australia, but Broadway is just as good.  Grizabella - London  Bustopher Jones - London   Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer - Australia. This version has a very interesting Mungo and Rumpel  Old Deuteronomy - London or Broadway  Jellicle Ball - London  Grizabella: The Glamour Cat - Tie   Memory  - Okay, Elaine Paige is about as good as it gets. But Debbie Byrne from Australia delivers a heart felt Memory also.  Gus: The Theatre Cat - Australia  Growltiger's Last Stand/The Ballad of Billy McCaw - All are good   Macavity: The Mystery Cat - Australia     Mr. Mistoffelees - Australia. The Australian Rum Tum Tugger is a lot better. And while I'm a huge Sarah Brightman fan, and you can hear her overpowering in this song, I still say Australia wins here.    Memory - Moment of truth. I love Elaine Paige. Her Memory is as good as it gets. However, some would say that Elaine's version is too soft and sweet, and isn't bitter and cold enough. This song could go both ways. Betty Buckley certainly expressed rage and power in this song, but maybe too much. In my personal opinon, Elaine's version is too soft, and Buckley's version is too cold. Debbie Byrne is a perfect medium, and she expresses remorse, sorrow, pain, anger, and loneliness in perfect harmony. I'd have to say Australia.  Journey to the Heaviside Layer - Not much of a difference. Tie between all three.    Ad-Dressing of Cats - Broadway. THANK GOD FOR KEN PAGE+music
Greyboy????+N+Listening to this album puzzled me. I went into it ...backwards, I liked Greyboy's later stuff, so I figured I'd check out this band. I was disappointed. This is really groovy and the musicians aren't bad, but it's like one of those Jam band things.  I don't mind jam bands, but their sound is too loosely wrought for me. And there is a little too much noodling with instruments that seems a little aimless. If you like the Greyboy Allstars, you will probably like this. But if you are buying this for Greyboy, don't+music
GREAT+P+To answer the reviewer below, I have listened to this CD five times already. It still rules. What does the "test of time" mean? You can pretty well forget how this album sounds like and be amazed by it ten years later. One listen could be well enough as well. It's great, that's all. It's not a usual collection of songs, it's something else - for the better. I have a lot of records in my collection, and for a change, I'm really happy to own something different. At least *this* record is unique in its own way. Also, it's one of the best tributes to American roots, and especially to the Beat Generation, that I've ever heard. Musically and spiritually. This record is the work of an artist and of a human person willing to express something in the best way possible. Got it+music
A Charlie Brown Schmalzfest+N+As others have noted, the &quot;Charlie Brown Suite&quot; is a ponderous, overblown arrangement of Charlie Brown tunes accompanied by orchestra and with little improvisation. Noises from the audience (squeaking chairs, etc.) are clearly audible during the quieter moments of the suite. According to the liner notes, Guaraldi's son has uncovered a lot of unissued material on reel-to-reel and other formats. The selections here are from the collection of pianist George Winston, a Guaraldi fan. I hope the remaining material, which he hopes to issue in the future, is better than this. The three tracks aside from the suite are more interesting; however, if you're looking for Peanuts music, you'd be much better off sticking with the three other Guaraldi Charlie Brown CDs currently available+music
A lukewarm effort for the boys from the jungle... Close but no cigar+N+Beneath the Remains, Sepultura's 3rd album from 1989  This album, along with Chaos A.D. and Arise, is considered to be the embodiment of Sepultura's classic era, and many fans consider this to be one of the finest, if not the finest installment in the band's catalog. With that said, this disc offers straight ahead thrash metal and little else. There are a lot of great riffs, great solos, and a lot of time changes, which will be enough to whet the appetite of many metal fans. Be that as it may, though, you should be warned that the boys really did not make an inspired effort on this record. It's basically just a slash and shred metal record with very little creativity or personality. An album like this really can't stack up against some of the greatest creative works of the genre, such as Metallica's ...And Justice For All, Iron Maiden's Powerslave, or Megadeth's Rust In Peace. I would give a track-by-track evaluation, but nothing really stands out here. I also have a gripe with Max Cavalera's vocals. I was really not pleased with what I heard from him, as his vocal style was not very well developed at this point in his career. Andreas Kisser and Cavalera sound pretty good on guitar. The standout track would probably be "Slaves of Pain." There's a great little bit around the two minute mark where Cavalera sings, "Open your eyes / Don't lose your steps / Liberty is a dream / And it also is real," then it slides into a spine chilling riff and a great solo. Drummer Igor Cavalera also turns in a pretty decent performance. This disc has something to offer, but what I've come to find is that there are some albums that really captivate you and there are some albums that you just can't get into no matter what you do. Unfortunately, Beneath the Remains fell into the latter category for me.+music
Great guitar, grating vocals.+P+Granted, it is obvious that the guitar work here, is worthy of placement among the best blues records out there. But as always, Winters vocals range from the grating, to the almost comical charactures, they devolved into later(and not much later at that),in his career.  The guitar work deserves 6 stars, minus 2 for the vocals = 4+music
maybe youre the whiner. OOOOOOHHHHH+N+seriously though, i tried to like this band but i cant do it. i felt like id heard every song before, and in case of 'loose lips' i definitely had. i dont think ive ever seen such a blatant rip-off in my life. if i were thursday id be pissed. im not in thursday and IM pissed+music
Shania Twain at her absolute best, great songs too!+P+This is the first Shania Twain album that I ever bought and it still sounds as fresh to me as the day I bought it.  Her personality and gift for singing with real feeling comes across here more strongly than most of her albums.  There is a sensitivity, warmth and zest for life that is communicated that is hard to put into words.  Both the fast and slow songs on this album are very good and the ballads are particularly moving+music

"JUMPING JOE" WAS MEANT TO SING THE BLUES! NOT THIS!+N+If you're looking for some of "Jumping Joe's" classic blues (See Rick "Shaq" Goldstein's previous FIVE STAR review of "BLUES DELUXE"!) this is not the CD for you. If you want middle of the road rock guitar, and not the full "smoldering, cauldron, of thunder and lightning, guttural, volcanic, power, vocals, that "Jumping Joe", is capable of, this is for you. For a true "Jumping Joe" blues fan, the only thing this CD will do for you, is complete, your collection of his music, and you won't wonder if you missed something. In closing, a personal note to "Jumping Joe: "please record more classic electric blues! When you put out something like "Blues Deluxe" you are truly the greatest living electric blues man under 70 years old! This CD is beneath you and your loyal blues, "street gang!+music
Absolute disappointment - BEWARE!+N+I am a huge fan of Enigma and have all four of their previous albums, which are absolutely excellent.  This is why I was so disappointed with this one.  It is random and directionless and much of it sounds like individual band members tuning up.  The entire album is pervaded by a supremely annoying, harsh, distorted electronic sound that grates on the ears.  It seems to me that in this music Michael Cretu has become a modern-day German full of Angst and self pity that no one could care less about.  Boredom and annoyance are the two lasting impressions of this album+music
Fantastic!!+P+Frederic Chopin is a very talented artist and composer. A must have of any Chopin collector+music
I had to say something....+N+I have read many, but never written a review before.  I felt compelled this time.  I recently purchased this CD and thought it a collection of the most ridiculous music ever.  There are a couple of nice tunes but what seems like it may have potential, is abruptly destroyed by some incongruent whim.   Thinking perhaps that I was being a musical snob, I asked the opinion of a friend.  She and I laughed so hard at how awful it was, so, I went for a third opinion.  The result was the same.  In fact it got worse with each listening.  We've decided that it will make a nice "booby prize" for my next party.  Avoid this like the plague.  It is musically inconsistent, non-relaxing and a complete source of irritation.  If you want your dinner guests to leave early by all means play this+music
Not really a "Special Edition" Soundtrack....+N+Yeah, ummm Disney, ya went wrong ONCE AGAIN!  This soundtrack only has three new songs as followed: Dancing on a Cloud (Demo) (Only really new track which is already on the DVD)   Beautiful (On Jim Brickman's The Disney Songbook CD)   Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes (On Disney Mania 3)   So if you already own the original soundtrack, Jim Brickman's awesome Disney CD, Disney Mania 3 CD, and the Cinderella Special Edition DVD... PLEASE skip this CD. Thank you! :+music
I'm Going To Keep It Real+N+Actually, I'm going to keep it really real. I know most of you reviewers  who gave this album 4-5 stars reviews are too blinded by 1980's nostalgia to see and hear that this music is utter crap. Vanity 6 was hot back in the day, but it was due to their s1utty image and not their music. Why do you think the only song you hear by them on the radio is "Nasty Girls"?  That's the only song people remember them for.  Let me tell you a secret: This CD isn't worth $29.52. In fact it shouldn't be worth anything because the music is boring- nothing 'hilarious' or 'interesting' about it. Plenty of of melodies being sung in warbly vocals over Casio go-go beats w/ no bass. I was able to download all of the tracks and after I listened to them, I thanked my lucky stars that I didn't spend one dime on it. Vanity was beautiful, but she couldn't sing or dance. Susan tried to portray herself as cute and innocent, but she couldn't really pull it off with that moustache. Brenda was just whatever. I feel sorry for anyone who buys "Vanity 6"+music
Excellent CD! +P+The Eurythmics fifth album entitled "Revenge" finds the Lennox/Stewert duo completing their journey from the New Wave of their early days and the more R&B/Soul of their previous album "Be Yourself Tonight" into a near total rock/pop sound. It was unfortunately where the Eurythmics commercial run started to wind down. That's not to say that this is a decline. Not at all. Even though a good majority of the songs fall into the category of typical mid-1980s rock and pop, there are many standout songs that make this a wonderful illustrious release from this duo. The famous hit song "Missionary Man" is my favorite Eurythmics song ever. The lyrics are among my favorite that Annie has ever written. Other great songs include "The First Time" with it's excellent and bizarre guitar effects as well as the fifth track.    The bonus tracks are very good but the remix of "Missionary Man" is a bit overstretched.+music
This is a great album!! BUY IT!!+P+I know there are a bunch of people out there saying "This gives metalcore a bad name" or "The vocalist has a lung disease" but honestly, they aren't metalcore. Trivium, Shadows Fall, etc. are classified metalcore, and they are definately not like them at all. Their music is much more melodical than others and have great guitars solos, namely the intro to "Bleeding Mascara". Let's go through each track one by one:  1. Blood Children - 3/5 - A nice intro that has a nice lead into the following song  2. Bleeding Mascara - 5/5 - I cannot stress enough how great of a song this is. The guitars in this song are amazing and the lyrics are very advanced. Very nice high paced song that is great for getting your adrenaline going.  3. Right Side of the Bed - 4/5 - This song has a very catchy drum rhythm that keeps you listening through the entire song. They chose this song to make a music video for, which was also nicely done.  4. This Flesh Is A Tomb - 3/5 - This song isn't the greatest on the album, but definately a fine song that is worth listening to.  5. You Eclipsed By Me - 5/5 - This song was the song that got me addicted to Atreyu's music. "I will not be broken, I am, the one" BOOM!! This song is a blast of harsh lyrics that will leave you breathless!  6. The Crimson - 4/5 - This song also has a music video for it. It's not the fastest paced song, but if you enjoy singing/screaming along with your music, this would definately be the easiest to do so.  7. The Remembrance Ballad - 1/5 - This song was probably the most boring song on the entire album. It never picks up at any point in time, the lyrics are weak, and the singing is terrible. Very easily could have been left off of the album.  8. The Interlude - 3/5 - Not sure if it was completely necessary, but it was a nice way to slow you down before getting hit with the next song.  9. Corseting - 5/5 - This song is bursting with energy! A crazy high paced song that keeps your rolling through the entire song. It's hard for anyone not to enjoy this song!  10. Demonology & Heartache - 3/5 - Not my favorite, but definately is a nice song. The guitars in the song are very nice and add a great amount of melody to the song.  11. My Sanity On The Funeral Pyre - 3/5 - It was really hard to rate this song, because it has a very slow intro and has a hard time picking up, but after it starts it does has some very cool bass guitaring that makes the song fun to listen to.  12. Nevadas Grace - 5/5 - This song is probably the most fun-sounding out of the album. Peaceful, yet with the screaming it still keeps the song very interesting.  13. Five Vicoden Chased With A Shot Of Clarity - 4/5 - A nice way to end this album. A slightly slow intro, but definately picks up with both guitars and has a very creepy guitar ending that leaves you desperate for more!  This album is definately worth buying, don't let your collection be without it+music
Burton Cummings was Certainly an Underrated Vocalist!!!+P+When one mentions the best rock singers of all time, how come Burton Cummings' name doesn't come up?  All the evidence exists on this disc that he was one hell of a singer, delivering some of the greatest vocals to some of the greatest songs ever.  Perhaps because The Guess Who was seen as a Top 40 group has kept him from his due?  Let's start with one of the top three songs ever put to tape, "These Eyes."  This masterpiece has all the ingredients of a timeless song - moving bass line, masterful strings, catchy rhythm, and the pained vocal stylings of Burton.  Elsewhere, he shines on "Undun," "No Time," and elevates the standard "American Woman" to legendary, something that Lenny Kravitz had no chance of doing.  Kudos to the compilers of this for going with the full length version of "American Woman" - the intro is absolutely essential to its impact.  I don't forsee The Guess Who ever making it to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, but let's at least recognize one of the greatest voices in rock and letting these timeless tunes wash over us in AM ecstasy!+music
This is why melodic death is good+P+Whatever happened to the good old days where Swedish music truly ruled.  Now, melodic death seems to be dying out in that country, with classic bands such as Soilwork, In Flames, and Arch Enemy all having changed their sounds completely.  I'm talking about the good old experimental days where everything might've seemed risky but the price of success even greater.  Albums like "Slaughter of the Soul" are true masterpieces.  They only come once for a band.  Every known melodic death band has that classic album, and for At The Gates, although they are no dead, this is it.  And to tell you the truth, this is actually where melodic death started, which is in no means bad.  It is fresh and brutal, probably what many people resort to rather than the melodic side of the music that bands tend to release now+music
The Song in the Movie and In the VW Commercial+P+Hey, like many of you I came to this page looking for the song that appears in both the trailer for &quot;Adaptation&quot; and the VW commercial.  The song is E.L.O's &quot;Mr. Blue Sky&quot;.  I hope that can help some people out+music
well, it's progression.......but backwards+N+lets revisit the history of the band plain white t's. their debut album "stop" was a very anthem filled songs about life and relationships that would appeal to mostly to people in highschool or perhaps young college students. this being said because the album talks alot about doing something with your life at pivotal moments and of course relationships.  next, came their highly anticipated "all that we needed" album and it had more of a 80's power pop/dance sound to it along with some of the songs possibly being mistaken for the band "the cars". it had a more diverse vibe to it and i could see it appealing to highschoolers and most definitely college students.  than this summer they released "hey there delilah ep" which was a solid ep which could appeal to many young adults with its mature sound to it.  i figured since the ep was so good, that their debut for major label, hollywood records, would be fantastic. well, just the opposite folks. the plain white t's have went backwards on "every second counts". i mean way backwards...back even before their debut album "stop". i say this because the whole theme of the album is about relationships, relationships, and relationships. after about halfway through the album it sounds like you're listening to a broken record. OKAY, I GET IT! some girl screwed you over, and then you screwed her over and now you really don't like each other anymore.   the lyrics is what really kills this album along with the cliche songs. the lyrics in their first single, "hate (i really don't like you)" is a perfect example of this. it cringes to repeat the chorus so i'm not even going to do it. i mean, the lyrics sound like junior high drama instead of maturer songs about life which were in their previous albums.  bottom line, they went to writing songs that highschoolers and young adults could relate to, to writing songs that junior high kids could relate to. i'm sorry, but that's not progression. i guess another word you could throw at these guys is "sellout" because that could very well be the case here. i'm just going to pretend they didn't release this and enjoy their other albums. don't get me wrong, the songs are catchy and all but the album just gets old and tiring after halfway through. i can't recommend this or not recommend this to anyone. old fans might enjoy, but also despise it like i do. anyways, their other albums are good so buy them before you ever even consider buying this one. download first..+music
Journey to the pass+P+This Cd was when Dance music was ruling the world. Take a journey back to the time of real music, and not a bunch of noise coming out of their mouths. Music had a beat, a rhythm a style and most of all, it had class. You had to look at your best to be able to get into Studio 54. Today, even with a baseball cap and eating a microphone you can talk sing. On this CD, you had to be the best to be able to Dance, Dance, Dance. The music on this Cd will take you back in time and relive the beauty of the dance floor, lights, and heart pounding bass that MADE you dance all night. This CD does just that.  +music
What happened Morten?+N+Sirenia is the only band who has never produced a song I didn't like--until now. I bought this new release expecting to love it all, with one or two epics like Euphoria, Sister Nightfall, or Lithium and a Lover. What did I get instead?--46 minutes of pop radio. Gone is the violin, and rare is Morten's voice. We get a bunch of Monika (who has a solid voice, but every song sounded the same). Please, Morten, tell us this is an early April fool's joke and that the real release is coming out April 2.+music
One of Alan Jackson's Best CDs+P+I am a big fan of Alan Jackson, and &quot;Who I Am&quot; is, in my opinion, his best CD.  There are two excellent re-makes of earlier songs on this CD, &quot;Summertime Blues&quot; and &quot;Thank God For The Radio&quot;, and they are both very good.  I especially like Jackson's guitar playing on &quot;Summertime Blues&quot;.  This CD spawned several other hits as well, such as &quot;Livin' on Love&quot;, &quot;Gone Country&quot;, &quot;I Don't Even Know Your Name&quot;, and the title track.  All songs on this CD are typical Jackson: great ballads intermixed with some fun, up-tempo songs.  This disc has a little bit for everybody.  Country fans are sure to enjoy this fine CD from Alan Jackson+music
$$$ unless you're a big fan+P+some people want to collect anything that says final fantasy on it. if you're one of them, like me, then get this. the LM box set has only the 2-disc soundtrack in the box. the box is there to hold the soundtrack, the Gackt LM redemption cd/dvd and the PS2 game. it's a very pretty box and the soundtrack has 53 songs on it, including the new singles (Longing & Redemption) from Gackt. amazon.com's importing price is outrageous though. find a local importer for this one, it's only 3,900 yen+music
Live from Las Vegas-Sinatra+N+Poor sound quality, not professionally prepared.  Some bits and pieces of a Sinatra live performance but hardly worth listening to unless you're a die-hard fan that cannot get enough of Sinatra+music
Que Hicistes J-Lo??+N+Can't sing, can barely sing or speak Spanish and can't dance like Shakira...J-Lo loves the camera and "thinks" she's IT.  OMG when is this nonsense going to stop?  Her "fans" buy this music so this woman "believes" she can sing.  She is simply trying to be "Selena" but isn't worthy even a glitter of Selena's gold...you should be ashamed of yourself trying to copy someone so famous, so talented, and now deceased!!  And, please, J-Lo stop "trying to laugh like Selena."  Selena's laughter was true and full of life and yours is the contrary.  Woman, you simply have no talent.  Ben Affleck must laugh at your outlandishness at how hard you're trying to portray that you and Marc are "happily married" and Dayanara Torres must thank her lucky stars that you took away the buffoon of her husband who is now your sidekick. Get it girl, your songs are annoying and irritating and it's obvious in this album you're also trying to sing/sound like Marc Anthony...stop!  You obviously have no style that's why you keep trying to copy others and wouldn't be surprised if you'll be trying to copy Shakira's moves!!  Please no more pretend music and recording studio exec...QUE HICISTES?? Even the album's title is awkward!+music
Poor sound quality+N+If you're looking to recreate the experience you had at a Soul Coughing show, I'd suggest you look elsewhere.  This recording is a weak (at best) audience recording that is muffled, muddled, and boomy.  I was almost entirely disappointed+music
Tizzight+P+I have had this cd since the day it came out.  I have always beena SCC fan, Murdasquad...all of em.  This cd is by far the tightest.  They have too many tracks that just hurt speakers and have tight a$$ beats.  A must have for me.+music
bsb are back for good+P+well what am i supposed to say? bsb have always been great and this song is one of my favorite from this album.i still is an amazing song and i would highly recommend it to any bsb fan! backstreet boys rock!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!+music
Get his other CDs instead+N+This is okay but it is not the sterling brilliant work Charlap does on his three previous efforts at all. Get any of those instead of this one. Get Stardust. Get Somewhere. Get Written in the Stars. Any and all of those three instead of this one. Another warning...this Gershwin one has the annoying Copy Control demon on it so when you load it onto your mp3 it skips and jumps. most annoying. whatever happen to fair use by people who buy the music???+music
this is just boring.+N+ok, I hate to say it, but this never grew on me, i grabbed it when  it first came out and, sadly,  still it's very weak.  I'm a huge Kool Keith fan and this is very disapointing.  By far it's his worst album.  He needs to get back with Dan the Automator or something, these tracks are boring and go nowhere, with a couple exceptions-- so if it's dirt cheap it's worth grabbing. This does nothing for me, I hope he gets back on track+music
Two of the same disc+N+I would imagine the discs are good. i was very excited to listen to it on christmas morning. Disc Two seems good, I wouldn't know about disc one as I opened this on Christmas day to find two of disc 2. Nice+music
Boston for the Death Metal Set.....+P+Ahh, death metal. Most people either love it or hate it. One of the biggest complaints levied against the genre in particular is typically the vocal style, which is (to the neophyte) an almost incomprehensible, guttural growl. Sort of like the crypt keeper meets the cookie monster. There are, however, many variations on this style, especially now that more "extreme" heavy metal has become more mainstream mid-decade, leading to a flood of different death metal bands. This Canadian group sets themselves apart primarily through an extremely poppy vocal style and superb musicianship. Sure, the requisite benchmarks of the genre are there-fast, heavy riffs and a vicious, almost acidic death metal bark; but this will suddenly give way to unbelievably catchy, hooky two-and three-part vocal harmonies during a chorus or verse then suddenly revert back to the "evil" vocal style. It really is quite unique and original. I am instantly reminded of the first time I heard a friend's Boston album in the eighties...It really is just a huge wall of sound, extremely well-produced. This really shouldn't work in the context of death metal, but it sounds AMAZING! Meanwhile, the guitarists are shredding all over the place in an often quite progressive and technical, and always ultra-heavy manner, as if they are auditioning for Dream Theater....the album opening deluge of neoclassical-style rapid fire twin-guitar shred licks are a good introduction to what you can expect for the rest of the album. The lyrics are a bit melodramatic, unfortunately, but of course, this is death metal. Sometimes it's kinda cool ("eradication of the mind/beginning of the end") and sometimes it's kinds lame ("floating in a black sea of agony") but always interesting. I am excited to hear the follow-up, which should be the band's big album, if this was just a warm-up....any fan of the genre should check this out, although purists might balk at the "non-traditional" vocal style. Highly recommended+music
Good for those with low standards...+N+I originally became interested in Into Eternity when I saw them open for Stratovarius during the 2005 Monster Metal Madness North American Tour. Even though they weren't the reason I was there in the first place, I though they gave a pretty good performance and I decided to look into their music.  Unfortunately, after listening to this album, I'm reminded that first impressions are not always accurate. First of all, I about laughed myself to death at album description under editorial reviews that states this album is "a must for fans of Dream Theater, Iron Maiden... and Nevermore....". This band has absolutely nothing to do with these bands or the music they play (other than the fact Into Eternity probably wishes they were as good as these aforementioned bands that are light years beyond their skills), and is obviously slapped here as a selling point. Then again, I somewhat can't blame Century Media for writting such rubbish, considering Sonata Arctica and Nightwish have left the label for Nuclear Blast (leaving Firewind, Dream Evil and Royal Hunt as the label's sole acts I care about). Also, calling this is CD progressive is a joke as well.   The album's only redeeming feature is the main singer (no, not Mr. Death Growl #1 and #2). Unfortunately, the fact he is forced to take turns with the two death growl vocalists and we never get to hear his full range or abilities as they sing songs with lyrics that are so predictable to this kind of music you swear some depressed teenager wrote when he forgot to take his anti-depressants. I'm not saying you can write about death, disease, and everything and anything having to do with moral decay, but you have to make it interesting at least and add some intricate song structure! That said, the only songs on the album worth listening to are Buried In Oblivion and Black Sea of Agony, were the death vocalists take enough of back seat to the main vocalist and spare the listener of their sad attempt of sounding cool.  In all honesty, I wouldn't recommend this album to anyone, because I can think of so many other bands and albums worthy of metal fans attention and hard earned dollars. Ok, so maybe I'm being a little harsh considering these guys are exactly "superstars" per say, but I think I've been pretty nice so far, as I didn't complain about the production quality or the drummer's stupid habit of banging on the same drum for 15 straight seconds and calling it music. Oh wait, I did complain, whoops...+music
A misinterepretation of beloved Latin classics+N+There is no doubt the artist's voice is beautiful.  However, the interpretation of certain songs by a man and child are way off.  For example, &quot;Tengo Una Muneca&quot; is NOT a lullaby, but an upbeat  children's song and to have a child drone it out debases such a Mexican  classic. One of many aweful and inacurate musical interpretations on this  misguided CD. For the best and most classic Spanish children's songs turn  to the tender and playful &quot;Cri-Cri.&quot+music
If This Is The Real Thing I'll Pass+N+I guess some people out there actually liked this, but not here. "From Out Of Nowhere" is somewhat decent, but after that the rest of this blows dead bears. I especially hate "Epic" which if not for this the group would never had made it. I guess because of the diversity to the song that made it popular, but it made me want to gag, and then vomit as the song doesn't make sense to me for starters, and in the key of E, and just droning on and on for over 5 minutes that it's worse than the gas chamber. After that it just got worse. 17 years has come and gone, and it still stinks.+music
A GREAT GENIUS&amp;TEACHER OF MUSIC+P+What Hasn't Been said about The Great Musician that is Louis Armstrong? The Man did it all.What A Great Mind&amp;Vision.Very Influential&amp;Very Original.AN Impact very Much Felt to this Day.This Album Showcases His  Genius&amp;Legacy.He is One Of Music's Greatest Teacher's.Ahead of His Time  with His Music&amp;Structure+music
All the others rock+N+Wished I hadn't spent that amazon gift certificate on this one.  This sure as hell ain't the rock n' roll of their other albums, which I suppose it's not meant to be.  I'm going to pretend that this album never happened and hope that their next release blows the top off the bubbly. +music
A Milestone!+P+Should you ever meet someone who's ranting about "the eighties" and the supposedly "bad" music of that decade... just put on this GREAT record! The songs are well crafted, perfectly recorded and the whole album is absolutely NOT "trendy". With that I mean that you could never tell it was made in 1984. Clearly you can spot it's not from the seventies... but listening back to it, NOW, I notice how it hasn't aged a bit! ...and it features the most classic lineup of the band! You just couldn't ask for more!! ;-+music
Inspiring Music-The Road Home+P+This contains a wonderful and inspiring group of selections and is very well done.  The title number accompanies an extremely good picture montage by GCS Distributing.Com which contains pictures of the military in Iraq and is a great emotion grabber.  This album is well worth buying and listening to over and over.  Stephe+music
Loud glam-rock music of the seventies+P+With a style that mixed lightweight, teenybopper music with heavy metal (a strange mix, indeed), Sweet ultimately ended up falling between the two, not pleasing anybody from either camp. Before that, they scored a string of UK hits including a number one (Blockbuster) and five number twos (Co-co, Hell raiser, Ballroom blitz, Teenage rampage, Fox on the run). Note that Fox on the run is an original song, not a cover of Manfred Mann's song. Little Willy and Wig-wam-bam both made number four in the UK. Their last major hit, Love is like oxygen, made the top ten in Britain and America - it actually did slightly better in America than Britain.  All seventeen of the Sweet's UK hits (including the minor hits) are here together with three album tracks that illustrate what Sweet wanted to do with their music. Having had their career controlled others (the production team of Chinn and Chapman), they cut loose on titles such as Restless and Set me free.  This is the definitive Sweet hits compilation. If you enjoy British glam-rock of the early seventies with a hard edge, you are likely to enjoy Sweet's music+music
WHAT IS THIS?+N+I loved avp but i mean come on! they made the soundtrack really stink+music
Maybe the best debut of the 90's+P+Gangly garage-rock guitar riffs, breathy French-accented female vocals, catchy tunes with insightful lyrics that capture the exuberance as well a good measure of the angst of youth.  &quot;In the Shadows&quot;, &quot;No  Guarantee&quot;, &quot;Point of View&quot;, &quot;Don't Believe a  Word&quot;--songs like these deserve better praise than I can possibly jot  down here.  You must listen for yourself!  One of the top CD's of the 90's,  I think. Their follow-up, &quot;Apartment Life&quot;, though very good,  falls into a safer pop groove.  I'm looking for their third one to be the  first great album of the new millenium+music
Uses for The Gift disc on Blueprint 2+N+The Curse disc is perfect, I will say that but The Gift can be used for the following things, other than listening purposes... 1. Frisby 2. Mirror 3. Toilet paper 4. Shooting target 5. Tras+music
Ethereal+P+This is Morricone at the height of his career. Here he created a score as mysterious and ethereal as the jungles and waterfalls depicted in the film "The Mission." Using a combination of flutes, oboes, strings, choral and other odd wind instruments, Morricone created both a unique and haunting experience that will leave you spellbound long after the last notes have faded from the air. The score could almost be classifed as a requiem, in this case a tribute to a people that are gone (the Guarani natives depicted in this film who were long ago driven from their homes) and the Jesuits who gave their lives to protect them. From the opening scene of the film, the score announces itself as the dominant character in the narrative, taking us from the lonely plight of a missionary on a cross, to the streets of colonial Asuncion, to the mist shrouded rain forest above the falls and the fateful mission where lives and beliefs will be tested to the core, combining native motifs with deep and sweeping string movements to fill in the places in the story where actors and the dialogue are silent, allowing the music to bring us down into an intimate place of reflection where we can embrace the sadness and the transformation that this film evokes. The only piece that I can compare this work to is Richard Strauss' "Death and Transfiguration," both works leave me shaken and nearly moved to tears. However, it's a deeply rewarding feeling to come in contact with works as profound as these. Buy "The Mission" and you will find yourself instantly transported to a place as rare as the bygone world the film depcits.    +music
Yeah+P+i loved this cd. this was alot better than Addendum but o well i advise you to get Storm and Addendum+music
Sadly disappointed+N+I purchased this album with such high hopes and when I popped it in to give it a listen, I was sadly disappointed. It was not the DJ Shadow that I knew. The majority of the tracks were rap, which would have been just fine if it had been GOOD rap. It had no flow, no connection and was all over the place. I took a risk and purchased this album without looking at the reviews and I'm sorry I did. Always read the reviews!!!!+music
once again amazing+P+If you are a fan of bonobo's work, you will definitely love this album.  Recurring is mindblowing and is my favorite off this ep.  Listen to the sample of recurring on amazon and be blown away.  If it doesn't make you want to buy the album, you are not a fan of Bonobo.  BUY this album now+music
SHE'S FINISHED...THANK GOD!+N+I am so tired of people like Britney, who has NO TALENT, she cannot sing, making "music". Where has all the real talented artists gone? Instead of recording real HORRIBLE music, she should stay home eating like a cow, getting fatter by the minute with her useless "wannabe" husband and keep popping babies. Her 15 minutes are UP! THANK GOD! Can the real singers please come back+music
Another good bad that didn't know when to quit+N+As a big Feelies fan and a big Galaxie 500 fan, Luna would seem like the perfect band for me. And they were, for 2 releases anyway. This band has run out of things to say. Dean Wareham's lyrics grow more inane with each release. Ex-Feelie Stanley Demeski is gone, replaced by a rather indistinguished drummer. Buy Lunapark or Bewitched instead...Penthouse is okay, but the decline started there+music
Ethereal and sublime goes Ricky Martin+N+Sorry, I'm a big fan of the first two D.F. CDs. Anxiously awaited the third...bought it without hesitation...mmm, sadly disappointed. The magic the first two brought to the world is what seemed to set them apart.  Cosmic, mysterious and almost spooky. So fitting to the groups name, Deep  forest made me feel sensuously connected to the natural world. Comparsa on  the other hand, though it must certainly fill the musicians desires to  expand their creative global conquest, fans like myself feel abruptly  misdirected. Harsh, tinny, fast Latin rhythems, overwhelm a majority of the  otherwise liquid and textural backbeat tracks. I just can't seem to kick  back and drift away with this latest endeavor. Unfortunatly, it reminds me  more of a Nature Company Latin sampler (don't get me wrong, I love the  works of groups such as B-Tribe). But if you're expecting more of the same  to come out of this beloved duo, get ready for a hard right. Perhaps their  next albumn will return to a kinder, gentler world+music
As I expected+P+I've been waiting to hear this album for quite some time and when I finally had my chance, I was not disappointed. Such an excellently done compliation. I would recommend it to any Final Fantasy fan. I couldn't pick and choose which of the tracks are the best, as they are all amazing. Pick this up; you won't regret the purchase+music
Chilled beats with some pure style from Kev+P+I love it when producers that have been around for a while bring out albums and rap on them.  This is the case, kev has got some more bulk in the underground hip hop world now and he's got some fresh talent like Kenn Starr and Cy Young.  The beats are amazingly sampled, giving real good kicking quality through your speakers.  Use of classic guitar samples and piano provide a peaceful smooth sound that is unique to Kev's style.  Excellent chilled stuff, buy it if you listen to the roots, slum village, or any stuff done by Jazzy Jeff since the Fresh Prince+music
Doesn't mix well+N+These three guys are amazing musicians in their own right but this album just doesn't work. From a theory and technical standpoint it's very good (some would say brillant). If you have a background in music theory you'll probably like it a lot. There is plenty of meat to chew on when it comes to breaking down the music and understanding what they are doing.   But if you have listened to The Police, Phish and Primus and you are just a big music fan then this is probably a very hard listen. It sounds like a car wreak of those three band's music and there really is nothing new. Trey's guitar work sounds like the work he did with Phish; Stewart's drums are just like The Police (more of the old Police stuff); Clay's bass is right from any Primus song. It sounds like what they did was take those aspects of their styles that would sort of fit together and just laid it out on this album. That's fine, but it's just hard not to think of Phish, The Police and Primus while listening to it.   The highlight of the album IMO, is Army's on Ecstasy. It opens up kind of slow and strange then picks up in a really nice jam frenzy for Trey's solo. That sort section of the ablum works really well together. For that section, it sounds like something outside the relm of Phish, Primus and The Police.+music
Not what it used to be.+N+Rob Zombie has lost a few steps when it comes to good music. There are only two or three tracks on here worth listening to. At least he's making good movies. I guess he spread himself too thin+music
Educated Horses - Rob Zombie+P+Another great CD by Zombie.  Every song is good; no skipping tracks on this CD+music
WTF?!?!?!?!?!?!?+N+DUDE?!?! What happened, when i heard about a new Zombie cd i was like O YEA! and then when i heard foxy foxy i was like WTF?? What happened to Hellbilly and Sinister kind of music?? I dont know what happened but, I'll admit theres a few decent songs like Let It All Bleed Out and The Scorpion Sleeps, but WTF?!?!?!?!?                                                +music
Boring.+N+Matter of life and death is much better.  Brave new world is lame progressive rock NOT heavy metal.  They don't even do a good job at making progressive rock either.  Check out Therion, Iced Earth, or Dream Theater instead.+music
Incorrect interpretation of lyrics+N+Regarding the review of Wesley Horton (Edmond, Ok) on 20 January 2005, I agree with his assertion that the subject of the song was a plane crash, not a car crash.  However, part of his argument for that is based on the following lyrics;  Then I looked straight at the attendant;  his face is pale as it can be he bends and whispers something softly he says there's no chance for me.  I think he is assuming that the attendant is a male flight attendant, which would lend support to his claim that the song is about a plane crash.  At that time, however, flight attendants 1) were almost exclusively female, and 2) were referred to as "stewardesses," not "flight attendants." (The term "flight attendant" did not come into use until years after the song was written.)  I think the attendant referred to in the song is likely an *ambulance* attendant (in the days before "E.M.T.'s," etc.) encountered after the crash.  I agree with his assertion, but I think the support for it is based upon a faulty interpretation of the term "attendant" in this section of the lyrics+music
answer to A Music Fan+P+Yes, Barry sang "I Go Crazy," the Paul Davis top ten from 1977-8.  It is on the CD "Summer of '78."  :)  I hope this helps you+music
Better Than I Thought+P+I was lucky enough meet them and see them perform and these guys are so sweet and have major talent! My faves off the album are Back Again, On and On, Suzie, Six Minutes, On My Own, and Civil Sin. The best ones i have on repeat though is Ivy Parker and Shoot Me Down. i totally love those songs cuz they're pretty deep. They have more of a Hard-Fi/Bloc Party vibe to them too. The big plus to this album to it is their unknown bonus track added onto Shoot Me Down.. that one is definately worth listenin' to+music
Review of Lean on Me-Best of Bill Withers+P+Wanted the classic track "Ain't no sunshine" and hoped naively for more of the same on this album but got only dated soul as honestly expected.  5 Stars are deserved just for that one track+music
ok cd but still crap+N+these guys without Max suck bad fire Derrick Green and bring back Max cavalera+music
THIS CD BLOWS+N+You want some real metal/tribal sounds stick with Soulfly! This cd is pure garbage..+music
Hard to fault the music+P+BUT, WHY DID COLUMBIA TAKE SO D#@* LONG TO GIVE US THE ACTUAL SET ORDER FOR PHILHARMONIC HALL? I found "the complete concert" to be unlistenable, knowing that some nitwit couldn't be bothered with treating this music with the care and attention to detail that it deserves. Flow is everything. Oh, now they care, for $139 bucks. How nice! And, for my money a box set really needs more rareties to be worth that hefty price tag. Maybe Berlin and Tokyo are supposed to be the inducement to buy, but most real fans sprung for those long ago. Am I wrong+music
Not my cup of  tea !+N+Sorry but I don't like this, always the same distorded guitar, always the same riff, feel like it was the same song from the beginning 'til the end, poorly done +music
step up from frances the mute+P+I thought this album was a good one.  I have been listening to TMV since tremulant first came out. I thought Frances the Mute was good, but it was just too much.  I loved Deloused and i think this new on is a proper mix of Deloused and Frances the Mute. TMV is still progressing with their sound and it definatley shows in this album.  If you are not an avid listener and do not own Deloused you might want to pick it up and start the TMV experience there.  Otherwise, I fell this is a great record.  Definatley an easier listen then Frances the Mute+music
plaY+N+One good song on the entire album - South side with Gwen Stefani.  Rest of the songs have some sort of rap guy and not much if any Moby.  Waste of mone+music
Absolutely Lovely Songs+P+Although I am an admirer of the fact that Maria Mckee has the ability to consistently shift genres (seemingly) effortlessly from album to album, I was very pleased to discover that this album has more than a little common - in feeling -  with my favorite of her recordings, Life is Sweet.  Alas, the Bowie flavored guitar is gone but the tone set by the quieter tracks on that 96 album is very much accounted for.  "My One True Love", "People in the Way", and "Everyone's Got a Story" are my favorites among the acoustic based gems on this strongly song oriented work.  I love the fact that all of these songs have such  memorable hooks, but some don't reveal themselves until a second or third listen.  And don't let the title fool you, but "Sullen Soul" is the most soaringly majestic track on the record, one that just begs to be heard from a car radio on a cool summer night.  So if you're on this page already take the plunge and buy the album.  I know you're curious+music
Great Concert+P+These four discs have some of the greatest music from back then.  The 8 songs performed by the great Jimi Hendrix are worth it for any Jimi fan.  The recording and version of his popular &quot;Purple Haze&quot; is the best I've heard.  This cd is truly on of his greatest performances.  The  Who's performance was also awesome, for it was their first show in America.   Their explosive songs amazed the crowd, and shows some of Townsend's best.   These two performances are the highlights, but theyre are also many other  tremendous performances with some of the best recordings I've heard+music
More Evidence Proving They Were Groovilicious+P+If you're a Style Council fan you must own this album. Phony musicians stink when recorded live but The Style Council sounded even better live than in the studio ("Home and Abroad" is also a necessity). This disc spans several years and features covers of some soul gems along with their own songs. They groove so hard on One Nation Under a Groove, Meeting (Over) Up Yonder and Hanging On To A Memory to justify the cost. The only downers are some snippets of Mick Talbot singing lead (oy vey) and a couple mediocre tracks, but those are minor trifles with this gem for us Council fans+music
High Tide - self-titled (Repertoire)+P+Originally released in 1970, as this was the band's follow-up to 'Space Shanties'(see my review). Also even has the very same line-up, except that group founder Tony Hill does some vocals. Just three tracks here, "Blankman Cries Again"(8:38), "The Joke"(9:29)and the epic "Saneonymous"(14:30), where Simon House's violin playing is simply superb. A decent progressive/art rock piece of work here. Most definitely an acquired taste. That's for sure+music
Possibly the best soundtrack eva+P+This soundtrack is as good as the movie. The standout tracks are Know the Ledge, Uptown Anthem, and its goin down. This is a classic in everyway. A mix of rap/r&b, and east/west. You cant  go wrong with this. My only gripe is a track or two from the movie is'nt on here. Kill a man by Cypress Hill+music
He couldve been a contender+P+Standout tracks:ITS FUNKY ENOUGH, MIND BLOWIN, LEND ME AN EAR, LET THE BASS GO, BEAUTIFUL BUT DEADLY, THE DOC & THE DOCTOR, NO ONE CAN DO IT BETTER, WHIRLWIND PYRAMID, THE FORMULA, PORTRAIT OF A MASTERPIECE, THE GRAND FINALE(west coast version of the symphony). Filler: the commercial skits are pointless are obviously put on to take up space. Bottom Line: DOC was proof(in the 80s)that the west coast had emcees that can spit with the best of them. DOC had a killer flow and a freestyle that can only be described as crazy! The production by Dr. Dre and Yella is superb at best. Its unfortunate that he got into an accident and lost his voice and is now reduced to ghostwriting raps for Dr. Dre and Snoop(what you think I dont know?). He could have been as big as Jay-z was in the game without the commercial appeal that Jay-z has. This cd is definetely worth being in your collection+music
Why Do We Romanticize the Dead?+N+There is probably no one in entertainment history who accomplished less alive and had more adulation dead than Jimmi Hendrix. If he is the standard, Adam Ant and Spandau Ballet should have died young- they'd be first ballot Rock N Roll Hall of Famers. WTF?+music
I don't get this release, but hey, it's Dio and it's Sabbath+P+Instead of a new Sabbath album, we get this.  Now I know a new Sabbath album is in the works, but that's just what the fans want to hear - new material.  Nevertheless, Dio's greatest hits with Sabbath is still a swell purchase.  Odds are if you are a true Sabbath fan, you already own all the Dio-era Sabbath, but now you can own all the goodies in one CD.  Post Dio Sabbath was mediocre at best, so you can be rest assured that Dio Sabbath is as good as it was going to get.  After reviewing the tracks on here, I'm a little upset that Southern Cross was not on here.  If there's one song that pulls out the best from Iommi and Dio, it's that one.  It's got edge, balls, and guts.  However, the rest of the tracks are pure classics and definitely do not disappoint.  So, if you're a fan, you'll probably by it cause you like to collect things.  If you already own the previous albums, the choice is yours.  The only discernable difference that I can tell is the obvious production value.  Mob Rules sounds horrible on its own, and the few tracks from Mob Rules will sound great on this disc+music
Once Again, Bell Delivers+P+I'll have to admit I steered a bit clear of Joshua Bell in the early years of his career. My aversion wasn't based on his musical abilities. He was one of the performers that a few music industry publicity people decided would appeal to a younger audience so he was dressed as a teenaged heart throb that seemed to belong on the cover of a magazine geared toward junior high school girls than a lover of good, serious music. I think I resented shameless attempts to lure a "younger crowd" into concert halls to hear a symphony. I was young at the time and it didn't matter to me whether the guy on the cover was wearing a tux and might be a bit overweight or if he looked like the kid next door or the woman was slightly flawed wearing a gown or if she looked like a sex symbol. All I cared about was the music and I responded by not purchasing any of the various wunderkind releases and Joshua Bell was in this category. Of course I could boycott the recordings but I couldn't ignore the likes of Joshua Bell. He was always on television, performing with symphony orchestras (classical music radio stations still broadcast a plethora of concerts at the time) and I think only the most closed minded listeners could deny his talent. Since that time I've seen him perform and what I've found is an amiable performer with great talent who knows people that while people are paying to hear him play, the performance has to be about the music and not the performer and even if he hasn't aged, at least according to the cover photos on his recordings, he has matured as a performer. His technique is still evolving which could one day earn him a place with some of the great violinists (remember he's only in his thirties, he still has quite a career ahead of him), and he's able to perform some of the works of the greet classical composers and pieces with popular appeal without getting gimmicky.   VOICE OF THE VIOLIN is a collection of vocal pieces arranged fop the violin. Each of the arrangements works well for violin. The challenge is performing them with the same passion we are used to when we hear them performed by vocalists. Just about every tenor and soprano of note has performed and recorded Schubert's "Ave Maria." Massenet's "Porquoi Me Reveller" from WERTHER is a showstopper that was a favorite of tenors from Caruso to Pavarotti. Fans of Fredericka Von Stade and Renee Fleming have grown to love "Song to the Moon" from RUSALKA. We've grown accustomed to the greats singing many of the works on this collection with beauty and gusto. Chances are expectations are high for anyone familiar with these works. Bell delivers. He evokes the emotions of each piece and in a way his violin does sing as he performs. This can be tricky. So often vocal works, especially those from the operatic stage, don't adapt all that well to instrumental transcriptions and it is the rare instrumental performer that can do justice to the works, but Joshua Bell seems to in this recording.  Fans of Joshua Bell do not need to be convinced of the merits of this recording. Some may feel this is not a serious enough recording but I think most people who enjoy good music will appreciate Bell's artistry and the beautiful melodies are sure to give listeners hours of pleasure.  +music
Not good at all!+N+When will joshua bell learn to record real repetoire, instead of these pseudo pieces transcribed for voice? First off, the pieces aren't that beautiful, and joshua bell cannot sustain any of the pieces... Just because it is a "famous" name does not mean it is good! Listen to james ehnes, a 100x better violins+music
expecting great memories, but what did i get?+N+i ordered this release last week from amazon and couldn't wait to hear it, but when i got it yesterday, i opened up the cd and when the player read the info on the cd, instead of getting 15 tracks of music like i was promised, i got 10 tracks and 44 minutes of spanish ballads!  oh, my lord, what in the world happened!?  well, i guess you can't hear 'em all, can ya?  i'll just be sending this disc back to where it came from and just hope for the best next time.  oh, by the way, the one star is not for the flirts music, for that is 5 star material anyway, but just for the shoddy mishap that occurs when you get everything in its package except for the right music+music
awesome!!!+P+I was born in 1984, I'm young I know. But I grew up listening to bands like guns-n-roses, poison, ozzy osbourne, whitesnake, and so on, because of my dad. I grew out of that phase, got in with the boyband thing, until the late 90's when i re-discovered the great music that was the 80's. I fell in love with the power ballads, I can't begin to explain when listening to a great song like that feels like. Its completely awesome, and VH1 has done a great job diggin out the good music and the music that should still be, not the crap they are playing now.+music
Wonderful music+P+Another review of a Govi CD that I should have submitted years ago. This CD opened my ears and mind to a whole new spectrum of guitar based music that caused me spend big $$$$ to upgrade my mid-fi stereo system to high end; a decision that I'll never regret.  Maybe better than any other Govi release, this CD showcases the widest range of his immense musical talents. The softly played songs are full, detailed, open, and introspective while "Viva La Vida" makes me feel like I am riding a galloping horse, in the southwest desert, at full speed while enjoying a day of playing hookey from work.  The end result of this fullfilling music is not only the great sound but the warm/happy feelings that the music generates. George M -- Phoenix, AZ    +music
Average+N+Average Singer with below average arrangements on often sung standards. I was expecting at least some re-harmonization on these tunes but very much  straight from the fakebook kind changes. The horn lines were not too exciting. Well....overall, very clean and straight+music
"Super Audio" format will not play in your CD player+N+Amazon ships this CD in a proprietary Sony format. It will not play in your player or on your computer. Amazon does not list this in the description!   I found out the hard way why a really popular jazz album is selling for only $7+music
Disappointed because...+N+The reason I purchased this particular CD was for the title song.  However, I did not appreciate the fact that someone dubbed in an introduction by John Wayne that begins just before the song starts.  What was the point of that?  Who wants to hear John Wayne speak every time one plays the song+music
oh my+P+this woman has such soul and fire in her, especially for appearing so demurre in photos ... i am in total aw+music
Just not the same+N+If you're into classical music, you know how different the same symphony performed by two different conductors and orchestras can sound. Same here. If you really love this score like I do, I think you'll be disappointed in the difference in sound compared to the original. I'd give this a higher rating if it was the only version available. But since the original is available on CD, there's no reason to buy this imposter. There's only 5 minutes more from Lion in Winter, and the mini-Mary score is nothing special+music
nay sayer+N+I think it is tragic that such an excellent intstrumental performance should be marred by some very unpleasant vocalizing. I can't understand why so many fans take it for granted. I would rate Keith Jarrett very high as a pianist; in the same league as Herbie Hancock and Chick Corea; if only he could keep his mouth shut while he plays his pianistic miracle+music
The Reason We Listen to Radio+P+Gloria's first greatest hits collection flows like the river wild, an incredibly enjoyable mix of emotional and heartfelt pop ballads and Miami club scene dance songs akin to having special access to the best radio station in the world. This collection of pop hits is easy to listen to and hard to turn off, which is exactly what pop music was intended to be. This 14 song compilation truly is the best of Gloria's radio friendly mix of Cuban rhythms and vocal honesty. You'll recognize every song here, which is quite a tribute in and of itself. From infectious dance songs to powerful heartbreak we get it all.  There was always an emotional honesty in Gloria Estefan's vocals that is missing among the new wave of pop stars. Talent and range are not the same thing as honesty and integrity. There is a reason Gloria Estefan has such a special relationship with her fans and has managed to have such staying power in an industry where a new pop princess comes along every five minutes. You can hear that reason even in some of the earlier radio hits. That honesty reached its zenith on Gloria's final selection here, "Always Tomorrow."   THE HAPPY DANCE SONGS  CONGA -- 1, 2, 3 -- RHYTHM IS GONNA GET YOU -- GET ON YOUR FEET -- GO AWAY  These songs truly capture the feel of Miami at night, their fun mix of Cuban rhythms infectious. No one has ever done this kind of song better than Gloria Estefan. Emilio Estefan's attention to every detail in the production of each song turn these dance club party songs into glittering images of pink flamingos, sandy beaches, and exotic cars. Listening to these songs is like watching the now famous opening salvo of images from Miami Vice. These wonderful songs we all remember are the next best thing to being at an open air Cuban club on a warm Miami night during summer.     THE HEARTFELT SONGS OF LOVE  WORDS GET IN THE WAY -- CAN'T STAY AWAY FROM YOU -- ANYTHING FOR YOU -- HERE WE ARE -- DON'T WANNA LOSE YOU -- I SEE YOUR SMILE  These beautiful ballads are no less special simply because they found their way to radio and were big hits. Sometimes there is a reason songs are popular with everyone. No one ever gave a song more emotional honesty than Gloria does. Each selection here, whether it is of love lost, love clinging to survival, or love remembered, has a touching truth in its lyrics and the manner in which Gloria Estefan delivers them.   "Don't Wanna Lose You" and the very sad and wistful "I See Your Smile" are of particular note, lingering in our hearts long after the song has ended. The beautiful "Words Get In the Way" is like an anthem for anyone who has ever loved someone so. Gloria would record a live version of this song in Miami and donate all the proceeds of that beautiful and special mix only available on the single for South Florida victims of Hurricane Andrew.    SPECIAL SONGS  CHRISTMAS THROUGH YOUR EYES -- COMING OUT OF THE DARK -- ALWAYS TOMORROW  "Christmas Through Your Eyes" has a wonderful and nostalgic feel; Gloria sings about the innocence and optimism we had as kids that we would love to feel once again. It is a very pretty song that will have you thinking about how you once felt also, back when everyone seemed kind.  "Coming Out of the Dark" and "Always Tomorrow" are inspirational songs born of a near tragedy when Gloria was injured in an accident and broke her back. She could easily have lost her life, and it would be many months before she would be her old self, both physically and emotionally.  "Always Tomorrow" is especially poignant. No one can listen to this song and not think about the life they have, and wonder if they are spending enough time enjoying it. Gloria's discovery that it could end at any moment and her reaction to it is truly heartrending. It is deeply felt and inspirational, and quite appropriately, concludes this most fantastic collection of music, which covered not only many years of our lives, but the emotions we felt along the journey.  The liner notes, in addition to containing the lyrics to all the songs, have some wonderful pictures of Gloria. The cover was shot by photographer Alberto Tolot at The Biltmore Hotel in Coral Gables. The photographs inside were taken by Antoine Verglas at The Raleigh Hotel in Miami Beach, Florida.     IN SUMMATION  The music is great, the production smooth, and Gloria's emotional vocals always perfect. She always made this look so easy that she sometimes didn't get credit for how difficult creating good pop music can be. Husband Emilio, a terrific artist in his own right, always manages to give just the right production to a tune, enhancing the flavor of a song while not overpowering Gloria's emotional delivery.   These hits are the perfect blend of popularity and artistry. In turns uplifting, exciting, and heartbreaking, "Gloria Estefan: Greatest Hits" reminds us what was good about listening to radio during the 1980's and early 1990's. This was the culmination of Gloria's dream. We can be glad that the dream continued, Gloria taking her music in different directions as radio changed. She found other venues, such as the Olympics and films to augment the occasional dance club favorite. And her Spanish music shows her growth over the years as an artist.   There would be a second "Greatest Hits" collection, thanks to those different directions Gloria's music would take, but anyone wanting to know just what is so special about her, and why she has lasted so long, must have this first one. It is, for want of a better phrase, the music of our lives+music
Lost Biker Psychedelia Of The Highest Form+P+Dragonfly was actually a band called The Legend who's debut album (on which they weren't allowed to play or contribute songs) was somewhat butchered by their record company. So they decided to pursue other interests. Under a different name (association with that Legend album wasn't gonna happen), they recorded this. They didn't have the best sound quality (crackles and pops still cover the sound on CD), but they had enough technology to mess around. Throughout this album, the track suddenly jumps into backward recording, slows down suddenly, or dissipates altogether. The boys explode into ridiculous giggles, get wasted by a moaning trombone, and turn into a giant rolling ball of mung at the end before returning to form. Along the way, we have some good songs. "Blue Monday" opens the album with a moan of "Oooh my God.." then harsh chords, before rhythm guitarist Gene cracks his throat in anger. "Enjoy Yourself" is bouncy, thoughtful psychedelia, "Crazy Woman" sounds very 60s and somewhat Moby Grape. "To Be Free" is a good bit of yearning and hope: the classic 60s message. There's just all kinds of good stuff here. The drums are fierce and the fuzz-toned lead guitar is excellent. There's some heavy solos on this album. Great performing. Gene's vocals sometimes sound like Keith Relf of the Yardbirds and sometimes like Jack Bruce of Cream. It's forgotten, and that's a pity. Take an acid trip ito the good ol' days of heavy psychedelic hard rock. It'll blow you away+music
Mostly good material, but little value added.+N+"The Day the World Went Away" was the leadoff single from "The Fragile" and is of minimal value to all but collectors.  Two of the tracks on this are taken straight from "The Fragile" (with small adjustments, one's slightly shorter, one has some pointless crowd noise dubbed in), with the third (a remix) also being available on part two of the "We're In This Together" singles.  But looking at the songs themselves-- "The Day The World Went Away" is fantastic-- bleak, moody, with a great loud-soft interplay, a superb almost lacadaisical and very matter-of-fact vocal from Reznor, and a fantastic wordless vocal at the end.  The quiet mix is worthwhile, with a chant at the beginning and a delicate intro before moving the majority of the piece to a piano, in many ways it works better than the album mix, but its a bit overlong.  I'm thinking if the intro was trimmed it would work much better, the subtle reprise of the chant works nicely at the end of the piece.  "Starf***ers, Inc" is a rather popular song amongst fans, but I've always found it to be a bit dull-- the verses are nice enough, with a great beat, and there's some interesting guitar work on the piece, but the chorus is pure schlock and the lyrics are borderline embarassing.  Material aside, unless you're a completionist, you can skip this one+music
Diecast and this album deserves full appreciation+P+First of all, I'm very disappointed by the people who have given this MASTERPIECE their sad, dry, garbage filled reviews.  Now getting back to how BRILLIANT this album is.  If you are into hardcore/heavy, aggressive music combined with strong, roaring but mature, melodic vocals blended with powerful riffs and drumming, you will love this album!   It's a mixture of Soilwork, Shadows Fall, Dry Kill Logic and All That Remains, which is what makes this album so consistent UNLIKE most noise junk these days that sound all repetitive and gets boring in no time. If you like these bands or their type of music, get this album and feed your ears.  Every song is absolutely fantastic. My personal favourites (in order) are: Sacrifice, Pendulum and Rebirth. The sampling provided on this site isn't really helpful so you may purchase/download these tracks to get a complete idea of how GREAT I mean they are and strong chances are if you are really 'into music' and not just sticking to the mainstream rubbish, this band is definitely worth giving a try and good reviews for their excellent efforts and hardwork. +music
Quite possibly, the greatest album of all time .... period+P+As a musician and buyer of well over 2000 albums from every genre, collected over a period of 35 years, this remains my favorite album by anyone at anytime.  IMHO, it is the most "complete" collection of songs that anyone has ever committed to vinyl and, given the state of todays recording industry, is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future.  An amazing body of work that should grace the collection of anyone who considers themselves a serious music fan+music
Weak, noncommital, and boring+N+In 1994, Morgan Heritage released MIRACLE, its lackluster debut LP, and followed it three years later with the superb PROTECT US JAH. Since then, the band has established a reputation for melodious, but uninspired, crossover albums that seem only to appeal to listeners with a casual interest in reggae music. For a band that began its career with glaringly mediocre music, coming "full circle" is nothing to celebrate.  In this latest offering, the band reasserts their formula of "safe" pop-reggae designed to be commercially viable in the North American and British markets. Like previous albums, FULL CIRCLE meanders from R&B ("Enough Is Enough"; "Your Best Friend") to watered-down roots ("Propoganda"; "So Much to Come"), with a handful of dancehall tracks bolstered by guest appearances. Between the electric guitar riffs and the appearance of Bounty Killer on the final cut, it's obvious that the producers are trying desperately to reach the broadest possible audience.  As Rastafari reggae artists, Morgan Heritage's generic message and nonprovocative image stands in stark contrast to the raw energy and fervor of such contemporaries as Lutan Fyah and Capleton. Sadly, both FULL CIRCLE and Heritage's recent live performances stand as further evidence that the band isn't interested in producing anything other than slick, commercial, feel-good Jah music. This is unfortunate, because the Morgans are talented vocalists. Most tragic of all, however, is that the only time Heritage is provocative is when they're preaching intolerance toward Christians and homosexuals in their lyrics and concert interludes.  Despite its stylistic and lyrical inconsistency, the album is not without its strong points; highlights include the catchy, uptempo "Hail Up the Lion" and the dancehall remix of "U've Got Me". Even so, there isn't nearly enough substance here to keep you interested long, even if you happen to love the album initially. Expect copies of FULL CIRCLE to accumulate in used record stores over the next six months+music
Mo' and Betta!!!+P+If you enjoyed "33-1/3" by the Frank and Joe Show, you will doubtless enjoy their sophomore offering, "66-2/3". It has all of the consummate musicianship, chemistry and inventive inspiration as the first CD. And it's every bit as accessible and enjoyable! Very highly recommended!!+music
Fat Possum Primer+P+Outstanding sampler from Nortern Mississippi Hill Country Blues label Fat Possum. Much prefer this sampler to the first one. This has that gritty country blues feel with many songs feeling like they were recorded in a leaky basement(and many were). Standouts are the two RL Burnside tracks: "Goin down South" is a staple of his music and the version included of "Walkin Blues" is top notch. The previously unreleased "I Feel Good Again" by Junior Kimbrough and Charlie Feathers is worth more than the low 4.99 price to buy this. The Asie Payton tracks are both stunners and Paul Wine Jones and Super Chikan add some diversity in style with there numbers+music
piece of foam+N+Tracks on this CD are very easily consumable. Two kisses the first song sounds very catchy but I don' t think it' s music. I don' t think he'd have  a chance in the US or the UK music markets+music
great CD!!+P+Solid CD - the highlight is Candles. Buy it+music
Christmas With the Rat Pack+P+This is Dino at his best for Christmas and throw in Sammy & Frank, what more could you ask for?  If you are a Rat Packer, this is a must have to complete your Christmas music collection+music
When African-American Singing moved African-Americans+P+After sampling this new Shanachie product "When Gospel Was Gospel", I can testify that this is African-American singing to the "nth" power. This style of "full-throated" singing is seldom heard anymore because African-Americans either prospered after the Civil Rights movement or fell to the  seductive power of "Hip Hop" genre that captured the heart, mind and spirit as Classical Gospel once did.  This music started in the 1930's when African-Americans were in their "Great Depression". And African-Americans have a Ph.d in suffering and hard times.  This music is a testament to our ability to "ground" ourselves in a strange land of North America and plant our beliefs, hopes, and aspirations in a musical form.  I am always impressed with these singers who have went to Heaven.  Each one has something to offer new generations of singers in tone, drama, and breadth of personality.  I recommend this CD to those who are struggling to find meaning in their lives.  Those who are looking for excitement and surprise.    African-Americans know about the negativities of life and we know how to create "Joy that comes to our mornings"                                            Rev.

Perfectly Dreadful+N+If celebrated film director Ed Wood (Plan 9 From Outer Space) made an album, it would sound like this.  The Transformed Man by William Shatner isn't flawed or ill-conceived, it's perfectly dreadful, reaching sublime and awe-inspiring new heights of schlock.  Each passing minute finds listeners recoiling in astonishment as they struggle to believe their ears. This   smorgasbord of embarrassing implausibility and pompousness is only possible through the offices of Shatner's hideously bloated ego which has blinded him to the project's breathtaking stupidity.  If the phrase, "So bad it's good," is in your lexicon, The Transformed Man just might be your guy.  (Warning: Do Not Operate Heavy Equipment While Listening To This CD.)+music
Quirky Melancholy Brilliance+P+Brad Mehldau first came to my attention with his percussive yet lyrical take on Radiohead's "Paranoid Android" on his album "Largo."  I thought it was stunning, ambitious, and fresh.  It gave me new respect for this song from Radiohead's 90s masterpiece "OK Computer"; "Paranoid Android" is a tripartate "Day in the Life" for a sadder wiser time more than 30 years after the Beatles disbanded.    Here Mehldau's breakthrough piece is expanded to 20 minutes in a live format uinaccompanied by his trio.  It still has riveting moments, but is less impressive than his version on "Largo."  There is plenty here to make up for that.  Nick Drake, a 60s/70s folkie rediscovered recently through a Volkswagon commercial which featured his hypnotic "Pink Moon," gets the Mehldau treatment twice.  Drake's already jazzy "Riverman" is expanded on, deconstructed, explored.  His mysterious "Things behind the Sun" opens the album nicely.  Mehdlau's idiosyncrasies seem under control at first but increase as the album proceeds like a fidgeting child still for only for a few minutes at a time.  This is just fine as the quirky jazz pianist covers another quirky jazz pianist: Thelonious Monk.  Jazz standards are another strength of Mehldau's since they need his strange flourishes and dense pounding chords to attain new life.  THe choices of Monk, Gershwin, Drake, and Radiohead continue to Mehldau tradition of being a liason between traditional and avant-garde jazz.  This live album, with its enthusiatic Japanese audience, requires patience with its long meanderings, which are sometimes too far from the melody he's interpreting and just generally overlong.  My four-star review is to say:  There's more here interesting than distracting+music
Another of the greats has degenerated into total pop garbage+N+Back in the beginning of the extreme music genesis, these guys were one of the pioneers of extreme music.  They certainly weren't any of the forms of extreme metal and they certainly weren't punk.  Unfortunately, they were put into the alternative category which was a catch-all for music that was basically pop while supposedly rejecting the "mainstream sound".  That's right The Butthole Surfers were stuck in the category that cursed the world with Nirvana / Nine Inch Nails / Ministry / Smashing Pumpkins garbage.  Oh, that reminds me, it cursed the 80s with all those hideous Sub-Pop label bands.  Still there were a few "alternative" bands that were quite good.  Only the Surfers and Big Black come to mind though.  Their live shows were incredible.  Flashing movie clips flashed strange scenes in the back ground including sex change operation footage.  The singer constantly lit his hand on fire for some reason (as if it were a big dangerous stunt), naked women danced on stage, and a certain song they used a huge tuba.  Their two best albums were Hairway to Steven and Locust Abortion Technician but some of the earlier ones could be considered as good as these two.  There song styles varied from song to song.  They would have crazy fast songs such as Human Cannonball or really slow drugged out songs such as 22 going on 23 with a depressed radio talk show clip played in the background.  They would also utilize oriental sounds modified in their own weird style on the classic Kuntz(spelling).  We also got the weird rantings on "Johnny Smokes" who was a "crippled midget lesbian boy who stood ten foot tall WITH A KNIFE!"  Well, they got to be pretty popular and appeared on the alternative music fest tour Lollapalooza and soon after actually got signed to a major label.  The last I heard probably over 10 years old was some songs off of the major label release "Independent Worm Saloon".  They had seriously sold out their style degenerating in a more acceptable mainstream sound.  I hadn't paid attention for these many years but recently checked out this Weird Revolution.    This has got to be one of the most extreme sell-out jobs ever.  I can't think of a worse bit of conforming to please mainstream record labels hoping for success.  I have seen plenty and most of them quite bad but I honestly can't think of any that tops this.  This is the kind of pumping technopop you see in bad movies.  What happened?   I am not aware of how popular these guys have become or not but it is one of the saddest falls of a great band I have ever known+music
Best Breakup Album Ever+P+Just a short commentary - Written after a painful divorce, "Bare" is a haunting summary of the many emotions that come crashing in following a breakup.  Musically, the songs have all the pop expertise you'd expect from AL - combined with lyrics that lay bare the pain and hope of starting over again.  Buy it.  Buy it for your friends who've been left behind by a lover or a husband, buy it for yourself.  I keep it in my album rotation for sad days+music
When Annie bares it all...+P+I've been a fan of Annie for quite a while, and this album sticks to me the most other than her previous releases (don't know if it's because this is the first album of Annie that I've bought, or because I have personal recollection to this album -- maybe both..) Anyway, I have to say that this album is a rare album to be found in nowadays highly commercialized music industry. In this album (which sadly is Annie's most unknown/unheard album), Annie Lennox sheds her deepest soul and her truths, unabashedly. I can understand why a lot of people dislike/hate this album while they are fans of "Diva"...this album ain't no "Diva"... Annie's life has changed throughout the 11 years span between the relase of "Diva" and "Bare", so it's kind of funny to me people hating this record because Annie is considered to be "a whining 50-years-old woman" (How cruel, isn't it?)  What's more personal is that Lennox wrote all the tracks herself, making this a highly original, innovative, fresh yet revealing and honest record..Gone are the 80's/90's synthesizer sounds, replaced by keyboards-oriented sounds.  All the tracks are about being hurt/sad yet also surrendering like the melodic "A Thousand Beautiful Things", "The Saddest Song I've Got" (indeed, her saddest song), the wonderfully layered "Honestly" and the dance influenced "Bitter Pill" Her anger and pain can be seen on songs like "Pavement Cracks" , "Erased" and "Twisted" where on "The Hurting Time" Annie gets wise with the lyrics: "So tell me what they day brings/ Has it lost its thrill? / Are you still searching, hoping for that empty space to fill? / And everything you turn to / Is like a mirror on the shelf/ And the one that you're blaming is yourself.." wrapped in jazzy sounds, creating a highly spiritual listening.  "Loneliness" is the return to the 80's rock sounds, with heart wrenching lyrics : "I've got a longing that's hard to find/Won't give me no peace of mind/Something that I've lived with all along/Days and weeks and months and years/ Filling in the time my dear/ But somehow I still keep on going strong", where we can see her sadness but also willing to be strong, facing the truth.  The last track, "Oh God (Prayer)", is a short sad song, filled with questions to God, soaring her pain: "If you can see me/ If you can hear me/ I know that I can't be that strong/ 'cause Everything I ever did went wrong"...  All that being said, this is the album that you will listen to over and over again while going through a rough time...it's about releasing your pain, sadness and anger, and also willing to be strong again...Listening to this album is not just listening, it's an experience which we can relate to and learn from+music
NO NO NO NO+N+Two Words for this bulls**t they call an album: STRAIGHT GARBAGE!!!!!!!! What were they thinking. Bone Thugs are my favorite rap group of all time, but what the hell is this? Every track is horrible. They could've left this CD at the record company. If I could, I would give this CD 0 stars+music
Excellent+P+I really like this CD, I am not a hard core fan of the group, I just happen to grow up in the 80's. But this CD is excellent and I recommend it.+music
CHRISTMAS MEMORIES+P+THE ANDY WILLIAMS CHRISTMAS ALBUM BELONGS IN EVERYONES'S CHRISTMAS MUSIC COLLECTION. IT IS FILLED WITH TRADITIONAL & FUN CHRISTMAS SONGS, AND FULL OF HOLIDAY WARMTH. ANDY'S VOICE FILLS EACH SONG WITH MEANING. IT'S A GREAT QUALITY CD FOR THE PRICE+music
Art Of The Theremin +P+This recording is the definitive standard by which all other theremin recordings will be judged.  To put it succinctly, it is marvelous! Howard Mossman Swarthmore, Pa+music
Fool me once, shame on you+N+...This had the SACD logo sticker on the cover and the way the logo is designed, implied that this was in 5:1.  Shame on you.  It is in stereo.  I have always enjoyed this album that came out when I was in high school and have a stereo copy already.  When I saw it in the SACD section of Best Buy, I thought it would be the livin end to have it in surround sound!  It was a severe disappointment to see that it says Stereo in small letters on the back after I had opened it already.  If I hadn't opened it, I would have returned it.  Why bother putting out a SACD if it is only in stereo??+music
Good God!+P+Wow.....Sam Popat must have been hurt a lot in life, because his selection of music is so personal and painful, yet exquisite and beautiful....thank you, thank you Sam for once again breathing life back in to this collection, this is so much like the first three releases of the series, and if I daresay...TOPS THEM!  if you want music that is intimate personal and you can chill to, do not pass this up+music
Why listen to it for free when you can pay for it?+N+ClearChannel strikes again!  First they bought up all the rights to the great classic rock bands music; then they saw to it that any NEW music those bands recorded would never see the light of day (BTO, Skynyrd, Molly Hatchet, and many others are still making great records, but ClearChannel radio stations will not play them); now, they're spitting out their own Digital K-Tel compilations.  To their credit, this is a pretty good batch of music.  It's missing a few great bands, simply because those are the bands that didn't sell their souls over to ClearChannel to pay off the dealers and bookies.  Rush, Zeppelin, Floyd, The Stones, Springsteen, AC/DC, all not here because they held on to the rights to their music.  Smart move guys.  They can still get their new material played.  So, if you live in a rural area where the nearest classic rock radio station just doesn't come in to good, pick this up.  Otherwise, you really don't have to look to far to find this stuff, and ClearChannel really doesn't need anymore of your money to encourage them to continute bastardizing the music industry+music
Very Nice!+P+I have been listening to this album for two Christmas seasons and never seem to tire of it.  The instrumental pieces are very well done, beautifully providing delicate, intricate harmonies.  The vocal numbers are equally well done.  There is a nice selection of songs, some familiar to the modern listener, and some providing a good introduction to medieval music.  This is Christmas music for all ages+music
It's Alright in the Monkey House+N+These guys have the corner on strange listen to me if you are curious music that most of the time makes you wonder if it makes sense, or if you are really entertained.  I bought it for the theme song from Veronica Mars, We Used to be Friends, which is a great tune.  I find it hard to find anthing else that matches up to it.  I have muddled through it, but wish I would have found it elsewher+music
Maria, you still haven't landed+P+I absolutely LOVE this album -- favorite of the year.  I see the user reviews are all over the board.  I guess I am not surprised.  I was taken aback by her prior album, Life is Sweet.  Maybe I was expecting something more like her earlier work then, but I got into it over time and I still love it.  So I think I was more open minded and trusting when High Dive came out after so many years, having no idea what to expect.  I can't say I love every track on the second half of the disk, but there's just so much that is GREAT and it is so unbelievably ambitious.  Just a huge record.   Thank you, Maria+music
It doesn't work.+N+Heifetz is the supreme violinist of the 20th century.  He was without a peer in his class when it comes to Romantic pieces.  These sonatas and partitas are not quite right for him.  His approach was not of the usual high standard that he set in his other recordings+music
This "Oldie" is definitely a "GOODIE" !!!+P+I was familiar with a few songs by Gene Pitney that I include in my favorite "oldies". After listening to the entire CD, I am impressed by the range of talent by Mr. Pitney and how many fantastic songs he recorded. As far as the price; I feel I received more than I paid for. This CD is a "MUST HAVE" and would be a compliment to any home collection+music
Just great.+P+This is a great CD. Great songs, sung by a great artist. Good selection. Good sound quality. This CD is worth every cent you pay for it and if you are 40 or older this CD should not miss in your collection. It will bring back wonderful memories of a wonderful era+music
Wildly Overrated!+N+The fact that as of this writing 20+ copies are available new and used at big discounts might be a warning sign. The big-concept selling point here is that on this album PWR was finally freed to be his highly original self,and played tunes by Ornette Coleman,Coltrane,and Monk (along with his more standard fare). However,on these supposed epochal encounters with the ultra-moderns,he does little more than state the themes as written,with no improvisation at all on two and minimal improvisation on the third. Critics whom I trust praised this highly,and I bought it on their recommendation--my mistake; don't make it+music
Jusst looking at the controversy ...+P+generated in these reviews tells me there's something important in this album.  Here's what I think ...  Sometimes you hear a tune and you say, "Wow, what a great copy of the Beatles."  A clear example of this is the Knickerbockers' Sixties tune "Lies."  A great tune, upbeat pop all the way, with no pretensions to anything but turning a buck with a beat.  God bless ya, my boys.  To my knowledge, the Knickerbockers are memorialized in the room at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame devoted to one hit wonders.  But the song is still a great copy of the sound that made the Beatles the dominant force in a half century of pop music.  Anyone who wants to debate this point can meet me at the side of the podium after the lecture.  But this album, "Bellybutton" by Jellyfish, is a subtle, loving, and cleverly complete tribute to the Beatles.  In its 10 songs, Jellyfish captures virtually every era and accomplishment of the Beatles, from thier earliest days of raw enthusiasm/talent/new harmonies, through the psychedelic growth years, to the era when the inexorable forces of the Beatles' unprecedented fame were driving them apart even while they made thier most innovative and insightful music.  Even this album's artwork  is a subtle evocation of the now-classic Sergeant Pepper cover.  Jellyfish members have clearly studied music of virtually all genres (OK, I don't think I hear any C&W in this recording), and the mix of influences in truly entertaining.  The songs are each little magic showcases for the impressive talents of this now-gone band.  Every one tells a story based on conditions and emotions -- heartbreak, shame, addiction, loss, longing.  The musicianship is outstanding.  Arrangements pay tribute to the kind of work that made George Martin a vital element of the Beatles' success.  I like the album a lot, even though it is more than 15 years old.  I keep returning to its spot on my iPod.  It never fails to snap me out of a bad mood and run me through a gamut of emotions in a short 45 minutes.  It's a great example of why music is so important to so many people+music
i didn't believe a word of it...hated the `tunes'...was thoroughly bored+N+There's a myth going around that Jarvis Cocker is some amazing poet, immortalising the average and championing the silent kitchenette majority.  There is an equally prevalent myth that he tapped into a musical vein that discovered something new in old synthesized sounds and cheesily orchestrated compositions.  In actual fact he both is, and has done, neither.  This record is consequently as bland as it deserves to be.   It is truly a non-event and should be avoided without giving it a second thought.  The observations Cocker is lauded for could be written by any 15 yr old public school boy who has watched Coronation Street or The Royle Family on UK TV--possibly more authentically and possibly better.  Musically it's pretty much the same deal.  You feel like asking him "what do you listen to for pleasure, Jarvis?  It certainly can't be hackneyed crap like this."  The whole thing sounds like early Scott Walker trying to do a number on a modern northern city...pretending, sub Joyce, that he casting it into an immortal and tragic frame.  The problem is that Jarvis has no muse.  There is certainly no Bloom to lift the themes and you're left with a sense of dull ideas penned on the back of  write-up from Q magazine.  I'm sure this CD will appeal to someone somewhere.  Good luck to them and bon voyage.  Perhaps I'm just too bored with mediocre efforts to lift my attention and join the party.  Jo Whiley can probably fill-in for me while I'm away doing something more interesting.    +music
Boring+N+Boring on disc...not a true musical theatre score at all!  Not Disney's best effort, but it will be a cash cow. Visually interesting on stage, but not enough to make for the extra-slim story line.  Kids will love it+music
asdf+P+lo fi, futuristic production and real raw lyrics about slangin white abound in this release, which suprisingly happens to contain just as much style as it does substance in a lyrically taboo zone which encompasses such retards as young jeezy and rick ross... these two do it well and are two of the more superior mainstream emcees in the game today... the production is also different and fresh... listen and weep..+music
A Blues Timemachine+P+Absolutely one of the finest live albums of all times.  I bought this album because it was listed as one of the top 100 guitar albums of all time in Guitar Player Magazine.  You get lightning in a bottle here with BB King at the height of his powers.  The audience is alive and you can feel the young woman hyperventilating and swooning to BB King's rendition of some blues classics.  His voice is flawless, still velvety smooth, especially when compared with later live albums by BB King.  There is the perfect mixture of BB King's introductions or setups for each tune, guitar, vocals and audience reaction.  The sound is immaculate, balanced and clear. His guitar playing is efficient and his timing is perfect.  It makes you wonder why more recent "live albums" lack the spontaneity and quality found in this recording.  The only regret is the album is not longer.  +music
Back when the music was real+P+This cd takes me back a lot even though I had previously never heard it before. I instantly started to compare it with other groups like Trixter and Warrant. I so love the fact that I can explore music on Amazon that I would otherwise not be aware of. This group should have been a lot more successful and well known but however they brought out this album at a bad time for rock when things were turning to grunge music and Nirvana+music
Don't Be Distracted+N+I've listened to this CD several times, and after reading the other reviews here, I just don't hear what is so great about this music. This guy does not impress me whatsoever as a trumpet player. He does not really PLAY the trumpet, he just toots some notes over some beats that some would consider "funk". The only stand-out tracks here are "On The One" and "Family", and they are just mediocre at best. Everything else here is just a couple of 2-minute "snippets" and some Parliament-Funkadelic-inspired pseudo-funk jams. This stuff sounds like this guy got bored one Saturday afternoon and decided to go into his garage and make some noise with his kids. For some real trumpet and real contemporary jazz-funk, I recommend Patches Stewart and Joey Sommerville. Check out their CD's, you won't be disappointed+music
OK But not as good as ones I bought in the past+N+This CD was somewhat of a dissapointment. Wasn't as good as I thought it would be. Was okay but definitely not one of my better Christmas CD's+music
Worst choice of CD I've ever bought!!+N+Having spent the better part of my life involved in the music business, I can honestly say (my opinion only of course) that this is the WORST piece of plastic I've ever purchased.  This is the laziest, most careless, most arrogant album I've ever heard!!  I feel as though I'm on "Candid Camera" and everyone who saw me purchase this album is on the floor laughing at me -- laughing the hardest is probably John Waite!+music
Sisters Rock Out!+P+The Ross Sisters-Amber, Sarah & Julia- who make up EVERLIFE- rock out on their self- titled CD !  Bright, sharp & upbeat these girls outdo most of the young male rock bands around today.    I enjoy every track on the CD but especially enjoy What I Like About You, Now or Never, and the ballad Angels Cry. The latter song- harkens back to their Christian rock roots and is very uplifting and inspiring!     It should be noted that the girls write many of the songs on the CD and play guitars as well. This is not a manufactured act but a real band!      This CD deserves to be a big hit- buy it now+music
Exciting, moving, beautiful, energetic, heart-felt, fantastic...+P+What more can I add?   Cecilia Bartoli just "does it" for me almost every time. She is just fantastic in my books. I love her dearly. She can give one an adrenalin rush with her bravura singing and then break one's heart with her pathos.  This is a superb collection of Baroque arias from "almost" operas! ;-)) I also liked the cheeky and none-too-subtle references to La Dolce Vita on cover and the images inside the disc. Nice to see an opera singer with a playful sense of humour!  I am listening to this disc as I write this review and all I can say is that I love this disc and it is clearly one of the best Signorina Bartoli has released, although I like all of her recordings. Listen to track 12 and you will buy this disc.  More, please!  PS: How about DECCA getting Cecilia Bartoli and Andreas Scholl together for a musical project? I'd love to see two of my favourite singers together on the one disc.  PSPS: If you like Opera Proibita, buy Andreas Scholl's Arcadia and Arias for Senesino, too!   +music
Miles playing REAL JAZZ+P+This 1961 club date was Miles' first ever authorized live recording and it features a quintet Miles was to discard a couple of years later in favor of a newer, younger group.  The music of the later group (featuring Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter and Tony Williams) was an experimental group that played around with timbral innovations, unusual harmonies, atonality and rapid tempo changes, leading all five members of the group to later experiments in jazz-rock fusion.  The music they produced was inaccessible to many and its status as true "jazz" has justifiably been questioned by those who believe jazz must be fundamentally rooted in swing and blues.  The jazz status of this 1961 group, however, cannot be questioned.  It is arguably the last true mainstream jazz group that Miles ever led and these recordings show the group at its best.    For me, the highlights of this set include Cole Porter's "All of You" in which the talented and underrated tenorman, Hank Mobley, delivers a magnificent, powerful blues-oriented solo that upstages the understated Miles himself!  Mobley's characteristic tone is unmistakable.  Miles' own "So What" is even more impressive here than the famous version on the Kind of Blue album.  The modal song is taken at a brisk tempo and Miles' solo is incisive, hard-driving, and completely assured - a masterful performance.  Mobley's solo is also a fine one, and pianist Wynton Kelly delivers a typically fleet-fingered, exciting solo of his own.  Miles' mastery of melancholia shows on Monk's "Round Midnight" which Miles performs brilliantly and movingly, though the other solos are not as noteworthy.  Miles again shows his lyrical mastery on the lovely romantic Johnny Mercer ballad, "I Thought About You".  Backing Miles, Mobley and Kelly are Miles' longtime bassist Paul Chambers and drummer Jimmy Cobb, both of whom are consistently solid.    If musical experimentation in the free jazz or fusion vein is what you like, then this album will probably seem unprogressive and unappealing to you.  If, however, you prefer the mainstream jazz tradition as represented by the likes of Armstrong, Tatum, Parker, Monk, Gillespie, and Rollins, then you won't likely be disappointed by these performances.  They represent one of Miles' best and last contributions to the mainstream jazz tradition. +music
Save your money..........or get it used.+N+I am a die hard Celine fan and I got this cd for my birthday...I have one word to describe it BORING. This is for little babies and their mothers. So I have it because I have it. Beautiful Boy is a good song though. If you are a die-hard Celine Fan you might want to get it used of save your money....luckily I didn't spend a cent on it.+music
H0-Hum For Christmas+N+For a 2-CD set this should have about twice as many songs on it with a ton more atrists. Good stuff, but not enough of it+music
Where to begin...+N+The "stick to Fallout Boy"-esque comments are just silly.  If you want to listen to noise for nearly an hour go ahead.  This is one of the worst LPs ever recorded.    All I could think of when listening to this CD was a hilarious wiki page mocking a fictional industrial band from Finland, who hide behind fire hydrants and record the sound of dogs urinating, among other things that don't belong in a review.  But then I guess I'm just too much of a pea brain to appreciate the depth of this follow-up.  Please.  Get over yourselves.  I hated the debut when I first listened to it, but it is near the top of my favorite albums of the decade now.  The difference?  THE DEBUT WAS MUSIC!  The irony (ironidence) here is not in the music itself, but that the album is a perfect reflection of the band - which is no band at all.  When your lead singer broods in a corner all day and doesn't even speak to the rest of the band, it should come as no surprise that they record an album that sounds exactly like three year-olds on a play date - or an industrial band+music
I wanted to listen to music -- now I have to reinstall windows+N+I'm tremendously dissapointed by this product.  I can't express in words how angry I am at having to spend 6 hours repairing my computer after the cd installed a backdoor on to my that allow sony to access any file on my computer.    Its infuriating how the goverment has allowed SONY/BMG to do this to us.  If a person has hacked millions of computers and installed software that allowed access to the entire harddrive, that person would be in prison.  Sony /bmg did this to us and they get away with a slap on the wrist.  Despite the harm that this CD has done to me, I'm keeping it.  It will be a symbol that I will use remind myself how our corrupt goverment is controlled by corporate interests -- and the harm that these corporations cause to increase their profits+music
A very good way to enjoy eighties metal.+P+This was one of the best compilations that I have come across.  It starts out powerful and ends a little slow but every song is good and it made memories come back+music
Hypnotic, Eerie, Playful and A Wonderful Musical Wild Ride+P+This 1974 release by guitarist Ralph Towner only reaffirms his genius and versatility as a musician/composer.   Teaming up with bassist Eberhard Weber, drummer Jon Christensen and saxophonist Jan Garbarek, Towner took 3 other very highly developed  musical personalities on a wild ride with him through dark spooky forests ("Visitation"), vast seas ("Oceanus"), deserts ("Sand") and more. Towner lets forth some beautiful Bill Evans-esque piano musings on "Drifting Petals", and even engages Jan Garbarek in a lively duo on "Winter Solstice". Things even get funky on "Piscean Dance".  Bassist Eberhard Weber adds not only brilliant electric upright bass lines to the proceedings but goes further to add eerie choruses of cellos and bowed bass. Jan Garbarek proves a more than capable foil for Towners full rich guitars and piano with his stark, icy, yet oddly soulful tones on tenor, soprano and flute. One of his best moments is "Nimbus" with its tumbling flutes and stern tenor sax interjections.   "Visitation" gets my vote for spookiest track on an ECM release. This improv piece is VERY effective in conjuring up vivid images of walking through a spooky forest at night, screech owls in full cry and something lurking behind the twisted trees.   All throughout, drummer Jon Christensen provides very flexible and empathetic playing, really listening to what's going on and giving his all without overpowering the other musicians. He shoud definitely get a MVP Award in the ECM stable (as he's appeared on so many ECM discs).   Prepare ye for a mindblowing listening experience!  +music
The best CD+P+I am typically not a fan of "Live CDs", but I have to say that this is absolutekly the best Live CD I have ever heard. It makes you feel you are in the Club with him. Todd Snider's music is some of the best for such a youngster. This is obviously not a highly produced/made over cd so the recording quality of some songs is different, but as I said you are in the club with him! There are a couple songs that I would have liked to have on there, but that leaves something for the next one. I have listened to it many, many times and I still laugh at his stories. I have let a variety of others (a wide range of ages and interests) and every one has enjoyed it. I recommend this Cd with out one bit of reservation. The recording issues only adds to the enjoyment of feeling like you are there. Shouldn't that be the goal of a Live CD?+music
To sum up...+N+Glenn Frey is to Don Henley what motorbikes are to fish+music
So nice to make love to....+P+I first heard a "Somethin' Bout Love" on the radio and had to have it. Then I heard the entire CD and it blew me away with its smooth, sexy feel. This CD is THE one to play next time you are spending an intimate evening with the one you love....thank you Brian for giving us this sensual set+music
Extreme Delight+P+Wow! As a new admirer of Michael's, (within the last 7 years or so) I must admit that I've been missing out on a lot. Abandon Garden just happens to be my favorite album of his, as well as one of my &quot; All Time 10 Best  Albums&quot;. I remember hearing some of his works when I was younger and  thinking he was the voice behind &quot;Kermit the Frog&quot;. I had a  chance to see him in concert once (Capital Jazz Fest, Coulmbia, MD   July'98) and was absolutely enthralled. I have the complete collection of  his works and I often play it for friends and co-workers. Easily, Abandoned  Garden is the favorite amongst them. Even my non-Jazz enthusiast friends  seem to love the album. My favorite song is &quot;A Fools Errand&quot;. Now  haven't we all played that role before+music
He's still got it!!+P+I have left comments on Tom's other cds and I am still always surprised and pleased with everything he turns out!! This cd is wonderful.  Tom's voice sounds deep and powerful as usual and Jool's piano playing is astounding!!! The songs are wonderful and keep you on your toes.  It has a great vibe and a different sound then anything else out there!! Hope you will fall in love with this cd just as much as I did!:+music
Pretty good exercise music+P+I bought this album together with "Breathe" on the recommendation of my wife because I have been listening to the Dixie Chicks daily while I work out.  I had never heard Faith Hill's music before but the suggestion was that if I like the Chicks' music I would like Faith Hill.  Of the two albums, I much prefer this one.  The opening number "Free" sounds like a Madonna tune (in fact, specifically I think it is really the same song as "La Isla Bonita" although I prefer this rendition).  This CD is not as good as any of the Chicks' releases in the past 6 years but it's still worth buying if you are looking for some variety at the gym+music
Thanks Harry Bosch+P+Everything Michael Connelly wrote about this album, played in Bosch's cliffside home, is true.  Beautiful music+music
koopsta can do alot better+N+Koopsta knicca is one of my favorite rappers but this album just didnt do it. He's sounds alot softer now and his first album the devils playground was 3x as good+music
Hmmm just imagine....+P+If this was released by the generic nu-metal bands in 2002, this album would be their best album.  Yea, my point is that In Flames didn't sell out in RTR. They still have solos in most of their songs (although less than their previous works) and amazing riffs (not as many dual ones as Jesper and Bjorn were able to produce before). And also Anders voice hasn't changed quite yet and still is as good as Colony and Clayman, with the addition of singing. Even though it is a step down, it is still sounds like In Flames. And speaking of a sell out album, I would reccomend Soundtrack to your Escape because that is a sell out!  Songs I'd reccomend from this album: Reroute to Remain Drifter Trigger Transparent Dismiss the Cynic+music
Lights Back On+N+I loved Lights Out 1 and 2, but 3 was a huge disappointment, even after a few listens.  Disc 1 begins with a robotechno caucophony that's just straight up weird, painful to listen to, and runs far too long.  The rest of Disc 1 gets better, but it still left me waiting for some climactic crescendos or wild mixing twists.  CD2 begins with an equally banal sound, and doesn't get interesting until about halfway through.  (In fact, the last half of CD2 is the only part of this set that I ever listen to at all anymore.)  Overall, the song choice is pretty blah, and even the mixing seems a bit sloppy and uninspired.  It's definitely got Lawler's dark and nasty fingerprints throughout, but it sounds a bit canned, and definitely doesn't meet the standard set by 1 and 2+music
Only The Best By The Best+P+I don't really Love this cd but one song on there really called out to me and it was "When Somebody loves You" I Love that song.+music
treeeeenndy+N+punk is dead, enough said. all trhey do is play 3 power chords in a repeeated pattern and whine about politics this is what punk is then? huh something soooo trendy its  dead beyond reason.  to be punk iso to not even be notified, dress as a punk its just to change. its a rebellious/defensive attitude. not a mohawk or spike or whatever dude this band/music genre is really lame.let it g+music
The first feeble bleatings of a jazz &quot;purist&quot;+N+I remember when this recording came out and Wynton Marsalis was being hailed as the second coming of jazz. I picked it up right away. I was mystified by the souless mimicry of Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers and Miles' 2nd great quintet--this punk was supposed to be the savior of jazz? Listen as Wynton negotiates technically difficult arrangements, stopping on a dime! Marvel at his ability to explore the full range of dynamics within two bars!! Gape in wonder at the fussy arrangement of Think of One that strips the tune of any semblence of swing!!! I get it, Wynton--you've mastered the trumpet, technically speaking, which is no mean feat. And you can read music. Bully for you. The only trouble is that you have nothing meaningful to say. Ordinarily, I'd feel sorry for you, having wasted all those hours of practice, except that you trashtalk musicians whose dirty drawers you aren't worthy of washing. People like John Coltrane, Joe Zawinul, Miles Davis, Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock...I could go on and on, but I think you get the point. This music is jazz by and for people who think that the best way to honor the past is to preserve it like a roach in amber, thus killing it.+music
Not One of LIVE's Best.+N+I love this band.  They have an amazing amount of talent. However, this album has fallen short of their greatness.  The first song is remenisent of "The Distance to Here", but you'll find out very quickly that this album lacks LIVE's creative song writing ability, and falls short of portraying their amazing talant.  If you're a hardcore fan, I would buy the album, but don't expect greatness because it just isn't there+music
The ultimate!+P+This is the BEST Jerry Lee Lewis album....Period.   If you like his rockin stuff, you WILL love this album+music
Beautiful, heavenly, blissful music+P+Ten stars !! Everyone who has a baby should have this music !  It is especially wonderful for babies with health problems.  My son was an absolutely miserable baby due to undiagnosed reflux.  24/7, if he wasn't nursing, he was screaming.  I first played this music for him when he was six weeks old.  He immediately stopped screaming and the most blissful, peaceful look came over his face as he listened to the heartbeat sound he remembered from his time before birth.  When I was pregnant, I had always worried that he was lonely in there, but now I know that unborn children still have one foot in heaven, because I could see that peace and bliss on his face as he remembered.  It was wonderful to finally have a way to soothe him and I was so thankful for the music.  I used the music very often.  When he had to have surgery at 4 months of age, we took this music to the hospital and after his operation we played it in his room all night long to keep him settled down.  The nurse taking care of him normally worked in the NICU, and he said they played this same music for the very sick and premature babies and the in the NICU because it helps to keep them calm and happy.+music
Cru, Seu Jorge+P+The music on this album is simple bueaty.  The sound of the guitar and his voice give a layed back feel+music
The Garden+P+An interesting refreshingly new cd that is not in the mainstream of current popular music scene. Relaxing but exciting, pleasant melodies with great musical textures. I strongly recommend to anyone who has an enjoyment of fine music+music
If I were on a Desert Isle+P+I have listened to the Don Shirley Trio since the 70's. My favorite song of all time is &quot;Water Boy&quot;. If I were shipwrecked on a desert isle and I could only have one recording this is the one. This man knows  how to make music for the soul. The Trio's interpretation of tunes that are  familiar brings a whole new meaning to the songs. Each time I listen I want  to get up and move to the music+music
Excellent Mediternean Music which is alien to Westerners+P+The classical music performed in the Ottoman Empire.  May be it is not the actually the same music perfomed during 17th - 19th centuries, but it originates from there.  An Excellent recording+music
Amazing young singer, hard to believe someone so young can sing like this!+P+I had to respond to a comment made previously;  "Another standout moment is her duet with Peter Cincotti on Neil Sedaka's "Breaking Up Is Hard To Do." Cincotti is clearly the superior singer here; he does piano here as well."  Cincotti does have a very nice voice, and when he begins the song one is immediately impresses with his voice. Unfortunately, Renee then chimes in and like a cat dancing with a pig, she trounces his vocals. He simply is out classed by this little girl! Like Sinatra, Cincotti has a nice voice, but he seems even more limited than Sinatra in his range. Sinatra was a fantastic singer, but he know what he could or could not sing, and Concotti is likewise challenged.  In contrast, Renee seems capable to singing anything ever written with the style of the greats such as Ella, and Lena Horn while also having the strength of voice of say Ronstadt, and Streisand. She may not be quite Opra ready yet, but I did say MAY not, as she darn well may be ready. At this age PERHAPS Charlotte Church had a stronger voice, but she certainly lacked the nuance which is needed for Jazz, and which young Renee has in abundance.  I good friend of mine who worked closely with bands like Huey Lewis and the News, Earl Scruggs, etc. quickly picked up on her youth when he heard her sing, most would not I suppose, but he was stunned at her ability.  The CD is not perfect, there are flaws, but as a package it is one heck of a musical ride this little girl takes you on! Last year I was hearing stories about her next CD out of Hollywood, but so far nothing. I just hope she stays with Jazz as I think it is the only formate where she can really demonstrate the full extent of her enormous vocal talent. I am very anxiously awaiting her next CD+music
their best album ever flawless+P+Every album by a.a. has been good verus the world was great and fate of norns was almost flawless with oden on my side is such a great album from vallhalla awaits me to prediction of warfare.Being a member of the astru faith this cd has become like a musical bible for me i listen to this cd alot and bar none no other metal band could touch this album this year.Their were many good albums from slayer, celtic frost,hammerfall, cannibal corpse, deicide,sepultura but none of them could touch this cd.My personal faves were cry of the black birds,runes to my memory, and god's of war arise, this cd gets my vote for album of the year but could be in the running for metal album of the decade.+music
love the music, dislike the dual disc+N+I really enjoyed the music, once I resigned myself to playing it on my DVD player when the CD would not play for me. I was disappointed the CD would not play. If I had known there would be a problem, I would have just ordered the regular CD.   Jane Monheit has some classic Christmas tunes, as well as some lesser-known ones, such as "The Man With the Bag" which I thoroughly enjoy. I don't find the melisma as bothersome as some other reviewers do. It doesn't seem distracting and allows her to make the songs her own.   Just for fun, I checked out the "live" performances and was unimpressed. With so many music videos that have high production value, her videos feel gimmicky at best and simply cannot compete. In addition, her lip-syncing seems amateurish. I cannot recommend this feature at all, thus my two star rating on this item. My advice: by the regular CD.  I plan to send this dual disc back, if Amazon will accept it, and get the regular CD. That way I can listen to it in my car and have the ability to put in on shuffle with some of my other favorite holiday tunes, which is why I bought it in the first place. I'm sure her CD will become one of my family's holiday staples+music
DualDisc won't play+N+I love Jane, but I'm going to have to return this CD because the DualDisc will not play in either my car or on my computer.  Worthless to me, I have no idea if the music's good or not, since I can't get it to play+music
battle of the christmas jazz divas...+N+Ho ho ho, what do you know... the two "it girls" of vocal jazz both released holiday CDs this year within days of each other... first it was Jane Monheit with the ambiguously titled "The Season"... then came Diana Krall's aptly named "Christmas Songs." So who emerges victorious in this battle of the Christmas jazz divas?   The first thing to consider, of course: who has the most gratuitous glamour shot on the album cover? Diana's suggestive and/or very uncomfortable pose in some kind of lawn chair wearing a billowy shiny green dress (strategically revealing as much leg as possible) is a real contender... but Jane's heavily airbrushed/photoshopped snow bunny/nymphette get-up (complete with floating bubbles for no apparent reason) is the clear winner in this category.  On to the tunes... I have to look closely at Jane's disc before putting it in the CD player... it's one of them newfangled "DualDisc" deals with a CD on one side and DVD on the other -- you can only tell the difference by looking closely at the tiny little print around the hole in the middle... once you've figured that out, you know you're in for a rocky ride when the soft-rock contempo-easy backbeat of "This Christmas" kicks in... you gotta give Ms. Monheit credit for trying to come up with some fresh material here, but this is some really cringe-inducing stuff... things don't get much better with "Merry Christmas Darling," a comatose, melody-free bit of nothing featuring a tinkly electric piano solo and overdubbed backing vocals. Things pick up on the more jazzy swingin' tracks such as "Man with the Bag" and "Sleighride"... however on ballads like "Moonlight in Vermont" and "Have Yourself a Merry Litte Christmas," Jane reveals a disturbing tendency toward Mariah-esque melisma that will make your skin crawl. The guitar/vocal rendition of "I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day" is nice, but next thing you know you're awash in the treacly jazz/pop crossover of "My Grown Up Christmas List" and heading straight for the eggnog... I do give Jane a lot of credit, though, for including the somewhat neglected holiday classic "The Christmas Waltz" (one that Diana apparently overlooked or just doesn't like...)  What about the DVD side of this "revolutionary DualDisc,"? Wow, folks... it's amateur hour at Epic Records... a faceless actor in the shadows pretending to be a radio host interviews Jane (looking refreshingly like a normal person) about a few of the songs on the album, interspersed with badly lip-synched "videos" of those songs which consist entirely of soft-focus waist-to-head shots of Ms. Monheit uncomfortably hamming it up for the camera.. yikes... oh, and you can also listen to the entire album in "enhanced stereo" (whatever that is)... the best plan is to simply skip the flip side... better yet, save yourself a few bucks and get the normal CD version if you intend to buy this album despite its weaknesses (when it's available again, that is: the original discs were recalled as part of the Sony copy protection "rootkit" debacle...)  Decision: Diana Krall over Jane Monheit by a (gentle) knockout...(see my Amazon review of "Christmas Songs" for details...+music
It's good to be da King!+P+For a "Best of" this album has a fantastic track list.  The sound quality is that great vintage "Pulp Fiction" surf rock sound that we have all grown to appreciate.  It's a BUY even if you have just the smallest of urges to listen to what this stuff is all about. Dick Dale is the godfather of this sound, that has become the staple of this form of rock+music
Gershwin's playing overated+N+After I heard this cd I bought Gershwin plays Gershwin on the naxos label which arn't piano rolls. Any pianist can tell that many of these rolls are heavily edited and can't be played by a pianists with two hands. On the naxos album that has some of these same songs Gershwin's actual playing doesn't sound very good. Many of Gershwins contempories such as James P. Johnson, Eubie Blake, Luckey Roberts and even Zez Confrey were much better pianists than he was, however they didn't have his melodic gifts as a composer. I would recommend Artis Whodhouse's transcriptions of Jelly Roll Morton's piano rolls (on the same label) instead because most of those are exactly how he played them and in my opinion Morton was a better musician in every way than Gershwin.+music
Very Pleasing Musically+P+The only problem that I have with &quot;Specialist in All Styles&quot; is due to my own ignorance.  That is, I don't speak any other languages.  Therefore, the lyrics could be mocking me for purchasing the album, and I would know any better.  But I don't think that they are mocking me.  I say that because the music contained throughout the album is just great.  These ensemble from Senegal is a group of clearly talented musicians.  The Latin-Themed music combined with African beats is a pleasing combo that I find very easy to listen to.  Again since none of the music is in English none of tracks in particular stand out to me, but don't let that stop you from picking this little gem out.  It is an instant classic for any beginners World Music collection, and will provide instant street cred for all aspiring music buffs+music
Brilliant First Album+P+Poerful, melodic pop songs. With a cover of an Arthur Lee/Love song. Buy a  copy now+music
Disappointment+N+I found that I was not disappointed by any of Herrmann's works, until this one.  The first track is good, but much of the others do not sound like the Herrmann I know+music
The ONLY good thing about this single...+N+I feel skeptical about NIN singles ever since they have stopped releasing them domestically in the USA. The singles just haven't been as good. The ONLY good thing about this single is the Live At Rehearsals version of Love Is Not Enough. It has a raw and rough feeling that I appreciate from the NOW too over-produced NIN. The DFA remix of THTF is too long - drawn out and redundant... like a bad techno song. Buy this if you collect Halos (like I do)... but if you're looking for a great single with great remixes... look for the promo 12inches instead.+music
The Title Track Alone Merits 5 stars+P+Milestones is a transitional recording . Sandwiched betweeen Round ABout Midnight and Kind Of Blue, it features Miles with Coltrane and Cannonball just before Miles' move to a pure modal approach on Kind Of Blue. For me the title tune is a stunner and it has become something of a jazz anthem for good reason. The contrast between Adderly's melodic playing, Coltrane's harsher approach and the perfectly understated trumpet of Miles Davis is one of those moments in musical history that make you shake your head in wonder. The treatment given Monk's Straight No Chaser is fantastic. This is right up there as one of my favorite Miles recordings+music
Looking Glass+P+I never had or heard this particular album before but if you like Looking Glass try to find a cd (or album) called &quot;Subway Serenade&quot;. It has &quot;Jimmy Loves Marry-Anne&quot; on it but all of the songs are awesome ( I like them anyway )+music
If you love the Raiders "do the right thing-buy Sundazed"+N+I originally purchased the set upon it's original release in 1990, over the years I have listened to it may times, continuing to comparing it to many other remastered tracks and cds of its time...always concluding that the tracks  (especially disc 1, disc 2 kicks in with "him or me") sounded like they came directly from vinyl,I have today just received the Sundazed Midnight Ride. Let me tell you if you love this stuff as I do, and want to hear the Raiders, pass on this collection, and get the Sundazed, the sound blows "Legend" out the door! I can't wait to get the rest on Sun.+music
SUPERB COLLECTION - UNBEARABLE SOUND QUALITY+N+Much has been made here about the Remixes on this collection.  The truth is that the audio problems go FAR beyond the remixed titles.  The whole of the 2nd disc is a washed out, muddy audio mess and it is inconceivable that someone at Sony/Columbia  didn't catch it before release.  This compilation is about 15 years overdue for a serious remaster. Some of the titles here can be heard in far better quality on the Sundazed releases, however admittedly a few of those have some excessive overmodulation issues.  They are still by far the lesser of two evils. At least the songs PUNCH the way the Raiders need to punch. As is, the "Legend" CD sits on my shelf gathering many years worth of dust.  It's far to painful to listen to+music
Danger Danger - self-titled (Sony)+N+First CD of five titles this worthless fourth-rate glam metal band had bothered to put out.Cannot believe they lasted that long.I remember seeing these guys open for Alice Cooper on his 'Trash' tour.Talk about your suck-support acts.Simply love some of the song titles here,like their Mtv video "Naughty Naughty" and "Bang Bang".Like,how long did it take for them to think those up?Other hair bands I don't care for include Trixter,Warrant(after CD no.2)and Firehouse.Total waste of time,money and effort.I've heard some patrons compare this band to the likes of White Lion,Faster Pussycat or Poison.Don't you dare!Danger Danger doesn't EVEN come close.Avoid at all costs+music
No Excuses....Add To Cart ASAP!!!+P+If you've made it this far and are a Dictators fan, shame on you for even needing a review to convince you to buy this!  Are  you hesitating because of the price?  How much have you spent on Dictators albums in the last 25 years?  Maybe you're  hesitating because you're concerned about terrible sound or a lousy performance.  Well, the sound is suberb (a great production job by Shernoff)  and the performance flat out rocks. (I'd like to add.....this is not iPod music.  This is  200 watts a channel and at least  10" woofers to move some serious air music).  The major bonus here is the killer versions of the "Go Girl Crazy" songs.  Even the remastered version of the studio album leaves much to be diesired.  The songs on this live album finally do those 25 year old tracks justice.  Satisfied?  So add it to cart now or go to zShops and save a few cents. If you've made it this far on curiosity & your music collection is lacking in the Dictator's department, this album is the album to get. "Viva!" is a great representation of what this band is all about.  After one listen you'll be adding all the studio releases to your collection fairly quickly. I only have a few minor "issues" to bring up. So, if you are not a fan of the band already, just skip my ranting below, buy the cd and come back to read this later. Ok?  The below may be considered blasphemy and I may burn for it. But I need to get them off. The only beef I have about the sound is the imbalance in the guitar mix.   Ross's guitar in the right channel is set on about "10" while  Top Ten's guitar in the left channel is set on about "7"; and this is a very picky, long time fans criticism. Second, this is not a true live album per se rather than a collection of live songs.  Songs  put together with very little between song chatter and  audience participation.  Some songs actually fade out to silence.   All this  gives the album more of a "live in the studio" than audience live recording feel.  The last song "Cars & Girls" was recorded at an audience free sound check and sounds no different than the rest of the album.  I was really hoping to hear a few between song sermons from Manitoba and it was not to be. Lastly, no music from "Manifest Destiny".  This may be a contractual issue however and not an oversight by the band. But the one thing that overshadow's all my nitpicking is Ross The Boss. If you have all the albums on vinyl, then you know where I'm coming from. Ross's playing here blends the ferocity of the Stooges James Williamson with the melodic playing of "Buck Dharma" with a little bit of Ace Frehley thrown in.   He's never, never, never, never, never sounded better. That's it....+music
I have loved this album since 2002...+P+...when I discovered it in Hawaii. Whenever I listen to it, I remember the peace I found there, and I used several of the songs at my wedding. In fact, the main song "Shores of Avalon" became the basis of the theme to my wedding last year. I also used one of the songs "Full Moonlight Dance" to create a dance ensemble piece with Persian, Middle Eastern and ballet influences, which was performed at a concert in Burbank, CA in 2003.  I tried to write to Tina Malia to tell her how much I love the album, and also think the musicianship is fantastic, but couldn't get a message through. Perhaps she is a true gypsy. Anyway, I come into contact with lots of different world music, and this album consistently rates as one of my top favorites+music
"Color TV" finally+P+At First this was kind of disappointing after hearing epics like "English Settlement" and "Apple Venus" and "Skylarking", but this is actually quite good, sometimes even on par with the three wonders stated before.  The CD clocks in at over an hour with the several bonus tracks from singles released from this album and two really different songs from a series of experiments Andy did, these are "Frost Cirus" and "Procession Towards Learning Land".  These songs sound pretty cool, but aren't the better part of the album.  The B-sides are pretty amazing with the three catchy songs that could have been A-sides "Jump", "Toys", and "Gold".  "Desert Island" is also an excellent song about Britain...."Don't Rescue me...No! No! no-ohhoh"!  The actual original Mummer tracks shine as well AFTER A COUPLE LISTENS, the singles "Love on a Farmboy's Wages", "Great Fire", and maybe even "Me and the Wind"(it is too far out in the album though, you may want to quit listening before then) will hook you on first listen.  "Love on a Farmboy's Wages" was definitely the first friendly song in the batch on first listen with its catchiness and wit.  "Great Fire" has a great drama to it that anyone will like, it is a wonderful tune.  Colin's single "Wonderland" has really cheesy production, so I had to skip it(it was so strange).  But it is actually a good song and is more than listenable after a few listens to Mummer.  The opening tune "Beating of Hearts" is a powerful song that is almost romantic and shows the power of humans that separates us from the animals....emotions and "Love"!    It is no wonder Terry wanted to leave XTC during this album, it is a dfferent direction for XTC...just about a 180 turn.  That doesn't mean this is a bad album...by all means it was XTC maturing.  The only song that is really similar to old XTC is the "Funk Pop a Roll" song, which is pretty awesome and funny.  Again it is slower and the songs completely different like Colin's "Deliver Us From the Elements" is filled with backing vocals that sound like they are from a church choir.  Andy's "Human Alchemy" is profound and sounds Afircan or something and is really controvesial...read other reviews here...it s a really good song with a message.  On first listen though production-wise it may be too much to stomach, but it is one of my favorites on here now.  "Lady Bird" starts off with Andy scat singing and turns out to be a most excellent pop tune.  A grand album with some questionable production, but that is the fun of the 80s.  Recommended for XTC fans, unless you don't like quiet stuff.   +music
These Guys Could Sing For Real+P+I knew I had to buy this CD.  I was 20 when Force MDs came on the scene in '84, and their music was the soundtrack of my young adulthood.  Listening to their beautiful voices remind me how much I detest post 1990 music.  This CD is a must for anyone who wants to hear what great harmonies sounded like back in the '80s+music
Sizzla Kalonji+P+I am a bonified Sizzla Fan and I love this album because he dared to do something different. It shows his versatility as an artist and shows all that bobo asante's have big beautiful hearts. I m in Love with "show me" and "Love you more" my son loves " be strong" and " nothing bothers me". This is a feel good album and I just hope Sizzla stays unchanged since signing with Dame Dash music group+music
I had to buy it to believe it....+N+...but it's true.  Sammy's gone country.  There are 2 MAYBE 3 tracks on this whole album that are any good.  My taste in music is very broad with one exception - country.  If I had to name one rock icon of mine, it would be Sammy and...Sammy...you really let me down with this album.  It pains me to say so, but I can't recommend this album to the classic Hagar rock fan+music
A National Treasure+P+It is not an overstatement to write that "Gershwin Plays Gershwin: The Piano Rolls" contains some of the most beautiful music ever recorded.  Gershwin's virtuosity as a pianist is spellbinding. While his compositional abilities are well appreciated, who knew he was so good on the keys? The listener will be swept away by this recording's sweet melodies, tender craftsmanship and sensational speed. One might expect Gershwin's songs to sound thin and bare without an orchestra, but given the man on the piano, they sound surprisingly rich and full. Not a stripped down version of the real thing, Gershwin on solo piano is a means to an end, a different way to appreciate his music. Indeed, while Gershwin's orchestral music may sound a bit dated, his solo piano work has a timeless quality. Inexplicably, George Gershwin's solo piano music has languished under the radar. While this may be true for most listeners, there's nothing keeping you from enjoying "Gershwin Plays Gershwin.+music
Strange  MAN+P+You need something like this to eaither get the pary jumpn or even have a good day.  I'll tell you once you hit play you'll get a smile oun your face. Scatterman and Snug are ingenious.  Matter of fact words can't even describe, so go ahead buy 4 because everyone you know is gonna want one+music
For purists only+P+If you bought this CD based upon Alison and John Waite's "Missing You" you are not going to find any other songs close to that on this CD.  This is a CD of pure bluegrass and West Virginia folk/melancholy and spiritual songs, beautiful and haunting as they are, particularly with Alison's voice.  There are 2 or 3 guest artists here and they harmonize well with Alison, but the bottom line is this is another CD of perfectly pure Alison (she produced this CD) music that meets her standards and they are high.+music
She's lost her way (temporarily, I hope)+N+I had such high hopes for this album before it was showed up. Her previous releases with Union Station were artistic wonders - brilliant musicianship and thoughtful lyrics that required repeated listening to fully understand the complex relationships and stories that were presented. I couldn't wait to hear what they had been cooking up. Unfortunately, they didn't do any cooking on this album and I sincerely hope this is an aberration. I WANT to assume that someone simply gave her some bad advice or pushed her (I like to think kicking and screaming) to release some pabulum and make a quick buck. Until I hear differently, I'll continue to hold out hope that she's in the recording studio with Union Station working on another wonderful album.  The song writing here doesn't hold a candle to "New Favorite" and "Lonely Runs Both Ways" and the performances themselves are pleasant enough (upon repeated listening, about four of the songs on "Miles" are keepers) but they are not the excellent work that I have associated with her in the past. Alison has the capability to sing the most beautiful, clear tone and only occasionally (to good effect) let a breathy tone in. "Hundred Miles" reverses this trend as she over-uses a breathy tone and in doing so lowers herself into the sea of mediocre, but pleasant singers that she previously soared above. Her song choices (please tell me that someone ELSE chose this mess of tunes for this album) are an embarrassment. Boring tunes, with silly or depressing themes (the body count on this album is very high - by the end, multiple children and adults have committed suicide, been killed, or otherwise died) and on many of the songs, I found myself glancing down at the time elapsed on my car's CD player as the music droned on and on (well into 5 minutes on too many).   The best song? "Down to the River to Pray" - recorded years ago before the bad influences who produced this sorry lot got to her. The worst? Probably "Missing You" which is such a shock to the ears when the drums and electric guitar start pounding at the beginning of the track that I had to check the player to make sure I hadn't accidently hit a button somewhere and jumped to a top 40 radio station. What on earth prompted her to record (and then release) such a sell-out? Alison - the lure of popularity is NOT worth it. Please stay true to your artistic roots and never again make this deal with the devil.   P.S. What are people thinking to make a song like "Whiskey Lullaby" such a big hit? I agree that the singing is wonderful and I love both of their voices and the tune itself. But it's all wiped out by the stupid lyrics. Why don't these two people pick up the phone and call each other? What version of what religion has angels singing whiskey lullabies? Who writes the words "put the bottle to her head and pulled the trigger?" I am drawn in when she sings (in previous albums) "let me touch you for a while" or "when you cross over there's no turning back once that burning bridge is gone." THAT's poetry. This is sad, silly junk. +music
Best 80's Metal Compilation Ever!+P+This is the best 80's metal compilation ever! I remember when I was in 1st grade, and I played this CD over and over! There is not one bad song on this CD! I still have it, and it's all scratched up! I think I need to buy another copy+music
Ciao,  downtempo lounge grooves+P+if you are a part of the wallpaper*, surface*, &amp; Sapphire martini crowd, this cd is worth adding to your collection. Also, check out:  Coming Home - Warming Up Your Living Area, from Stereo Delux+music
AT LONG LAST+P+I have been waiting for years, nay decades for this long-lost album to be released on CD.  This, the first of Karen Dalton's only two albums is, in my opion, the better of the two.  Karen Dalton has a voice that demands to be heard for one of the most exotic aural experiences we have in the archives of pop music today.  While I have been able to convince a few people that this is Lady Day singing, the arrangements just won't wash for such a deception the be successful for very long.  This is a voice that sounds a lot like Billy Holiday, especially in her latter days, and the choice of material on this album and Dalton's rendition of it are an experience only the lucky few have had the pleasure of hearing.  I doubt she ever will be well known enough to gain broad popular appeal, especially at this late date, but at least we don't have to search for the LP of this on Ebay anymore.  This album is a musical treasure.  If you have never heard of Karen Dalton before, buy this and find out what you have missed.  If you have heard of her, you don't need any advice from me+music
really sucks+N+If you really liked JUST WONT  BURN then this could be a  major disappointment like it was for me. Susan leaves the Blues for a smoother sound and leave's the fire and passion behind. Now there's nothing special about her. Susan please go back to the Blues+music
wonderful+P+This piece is haunting and beautiful.  The collaberation of the Chieftains and multiple female artists from around the world is so pleasing and mesmerising, I felt transported to another place and time.+music
sucks+N+this cd sucks so much. it's the worst casualties cd ever. it has two good songs and the rest are completely horrible and they all sound the same. and i'm not just saying that because they're becoming more known/sell-out and stuff. this is seriously one of the worst cd's i own and i bought it the day it came out because i am a big casualties fan and they were talking about this cd being one of their most hardcore and creative works. the only good things about this cd are that there are pretty okay lyrics, and finally we hear some backup vocals from the other members of the band, which was only heard in a couple songs in on the frontline. they need a new singer or something. and i agree with everyone who gives this cd a poor revie+music
Best of the last+P+This is the DEFINITIVE version of their last studio album. It contains more tracks and has a slightly different mix. None of the extra tracks are throwaway and some are arguably better than the songs on the original 'Driving to Damascus'. Is it their best album? I think it has more depth with the lyrics than anything Stuart Adamson has done, and he was always a great lyricist (these things being relative). If you don't yet have 'Driving to Damascus', buy this version instead. If you already have DTD, consider getting this one for the extra songs and the slightly different mix courtesy of Tony Butler, the band's bassist. It all works for me. Great melodic guitar rock, some of it very hard-driving while some of it very soft. Great, great lyrics. These are truly Stuart's last artistic statement+music
Great voice+P+I think it's awesome that you don't have to win first place on idol to get a deal.  Bo is really worthy of this.  He sounds fantastic+music
Bo Bice is awesome !!!!+P+Me and my wife watched American Idol and to be truthful we thought especially my wife that Bo should have won. My wife really loves his music and I got her the CD and now the single. I hope they let him rock the way he did on Idol because the man has major talent!!!+music
Bo Bice rocks!+P+He may not have won the title of American Idol, but this country boy can ROCK! Vehicle is fantastic and in my opinion (even though I voted for Miss Underwood to win the competition) - Bo sings 'Inside Your Heaven' a thousand times better than Carrie. The price of this single is so minimal compared to the enjoyment true Bo fans will get out of it. Don't pass it up+music
LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!+P+WHY IS IT THAT DESERVING ARTISTIC PEOPLE ARE SELDOM BROUGHT TO THE FOREFRONT? THIS GUY IS AWESOME! CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT HIM!  FRENCH CAFE IS MY FAVORITE! BOUGHT CARENCRO FIRST AND WAS SWEEP AWAY. MARC, STAY TRUE TO YOUR MUSIC AND BIGGER/MAJOR DOORS WILL OPEN IN YOUR SEASON...YOUR DUE SEASON+music
Gorgeous+P+Bill Evans is a musician you never tire of listening to. He has the ability to play a tune freshly, every time. This recording is, in my opinion, his finest. The first date after the untimely death of Scott LaFaro, this album is beautiful ,melodic and haunting. Every tune is played with typical Evans genius, but on this session he seems to be expressing his musical ideas with even more flavor and emotion. The first cut is the most expressive and emotive I have ever heard in the trio setting. I am sure it was dedicated to LaFaro, even though it supposedly is an anagram for the producer of the date, Orrin Keepnews. Evans expresses his passion, joy and grief for his young bassist in every note and the result is, to my mind, stunning. I love Chuck Israels' bass lines and the chords Evans plays quietly over the bass solo are beautiful and ephemeral. Every tune on this CD is wonderful, the playing of everyone is at such a high level of creativity that this music will live on forever. This is a can't miss choice if you like piano music+music
I'm so happy I bought this CD!+P+I've been a fan of the Grateful Dead studio output for maybe about ten years.  I've recently joined the real deadheads somewhat and have started to appreciate the live jams.  I'm coming along on the jam side of the Dead, which I think is the side that most deadheads love, but I absolutely love the great stuff from the "studio dead."  I guess the studio dead is Workingman's Dead and American Beauty.  This album should be bought by fans of those two abums.  I think this is from the same era, and Jerry Garcia really seems to be at some sort of creative high.  It provides a window into the "jam dead" in easily digestible 3-6 minute songs on some of the tracks, and further proof that Jerry Garcia could write great concise songs as well.  There are a few spacy instrumentals that lead up to "Eep hour" that aren't all that great, but, as stated in the liner notes, these can work as an intro to Eep hour.  If you're on the fence about this one, there are 7 incredible songs on this album, buy it+music
Building a better guitar+P+In the end of the 90s, some bands and guitar players decided to explore new grounds of music. Some of these attempts was successful, some were not. Good examples of artists that tried to sound modern was the German rock band Scorpions (EyeIIEye), Steve Vai (Sex & Religion), Jeff Beck (Who Else!, You Had it Coming, Jeff) and of course, Joe Satriani.  In a particular boarding, Mr. Satch saw the rising experiments from genius guitar player and inspiration Jeff Beck and decided to make an attempt into a more electronic kind of music. Now, the difference between Beck and Satch is that Satch was creative, bold and concise in his boarding, and Jeff, well, lost himself in the path.  Don't get me wrong, I love Jeff Beck from his Yardbirds/Tridents days to Beckology, he was truly a great genius, egomaniac, but genius, comparable only with Jimi Hendrix. But Jeff's techno sound is boring, noisy and truly out of place. He affirmed himself that his techno albums is among the worst ones ever produced by him.  Joe Satriani, in a kind of inspired mood and brilliance knew very well how to create his chops without sacrifice the music. He created a balance between him, his human band and the Pro-tools. He sounds fantastic in this release. Challenging, groundbreaking, powerful, beautiful and pleasant.  Rumor has that the title of the album was inspired in the molecular nanotechnology book "Engines of Creation", written by K. Eric Drexler in 1986. The book also have an interesting line that says that "what we can do depends on what we can built". I don't think that's a mere coincidence, considering the illustrations on the album's sleeves. Judging by that we can presume that we have a conceptual record in hands.  Of course, as an experiemnt, somethings goes very nice and somethings nor in such a way. "Devil's Slide" is a good example of a very cool, dynamic and inspired piece. "Borg Sex" is like imagining robots having sexual relations, and the song has a very nice mood. "Champagne?" is some kind of tribute to Jeff Beck, it's very similar to the sound that Jeff has been developing in his comeback album "Who Else!", by far, his best effort with techno rock. There's also beautiful electronic moments like "Clouds Race Across the Sky", witch is a nice soundscape song, and also human moments, like the wonderful ballad "Until We Say Goodbye" and the awesome closing title track. But the breathtaking moment of the album is the two-track song "The Power Cosmic 2000", witch is a nice improvement compared with it's version released as a single.  With this release, Joe got his foot into a modern and nice sound and continues to sound relevant. Of course, this is the "we don't need another one" kind of album. Joe knew it very well, since techno music sounds dated nowadays, and returned to his human sound in his next release. But as far as it went, it was a wonderful experiment and a very consistent work that still deliver us in a nice mood+music
The worst of the lot+N+Joe misses the mark with this one.  In fact, this album doesn't compare to his others even remotely.  Maybe he thought he was doing what was popular, or maybe he just wanted something different, but, to me, this album sounds like video game audio.  If you want some real Joe, buy Surfing With The Alien, Flying In A Blue Dream, The Extremist and/or Is There Love In Space+music
What in the world happened?+N+When I first heard that 4 Strings would be coming out with another album I was excited. I had so thoroughly enjoyed their first cd that I had high hopes for this one. The first single was amazing! The day it came out I ran out and bought it. I must have listened to it hundreds of times, it was so good! I couldn't wait for the actual album. Then it came out...My excitement diminished. First of all, I realized that Vanessa was barely on the cd. You don't mess with a good thing! Vanessa's voice complimented the music so well! Then a second problem arose: the music seemed like a rehash of the previous album's music only this time with different lyrics. What happened?! The only relief I found in this cd was the track "Euphoric Eyes." It's the only track that doesn't make me want my money back. (even both versions of the title track "Turn It Around" make me angry. I advise getting the single, as it has the best version.) So here's my verdict: Major disappointment. Why, 4 Strings? Why+music
There's a reason why this was one of the greatest sellers of all time.+N+For those of you who don't know, this ranks in the top 100 as one of the greatest selling albums of all time.  Right up there with Abbey Road and Dark Side Of The Moon!  There's a reason for this.  First let's all learn a new word today: commercialism  Webster's dictionary states that commercialism is the practice of exchanging or selling products between different individuals where each individual is trying to gain something they didn't have before at the expense of losing something they already had.  This does work one ways sometimes.  For example: In Britany Spears' case record consumers lose their money to Spears and Spears doesn't give anything back in exchange.  Or maybe she does?  She gives us images of her body which make inperfect looking girls feel like garbage.  She gives us paper from the linear notes which we could use to jot down notes on or use as napkins.  She gives us talentless images and sounds which make us thankful we have talents and vaules which she clearly lacks.  So why is this such a great selling album.  Because people are willing to buy the album and, as a result, get those great things I mentioned in the previous paragraph.  And there is a reason why those things are great.  Where would we be today without Spears' casual sex preferences encouraging young girls to have all the sex they want and thus come down with AIDS and God knows what else.  Where would we be without Spears' MTV videos encouraging us to sit around at home watching them while gaining weight from lack of exercise and eating doritos. All the while she stays fit because of her personal trainers and chefs that she got with our money.  And where would we be with out an idol to kiss the feet of and sacrafice animals to.  See, with out those great things we would be stuck in a world where people feel good about themselves, are highly motivated, and realise that you don't have to look perfect to be a good person.  Thank God we live in this world where everbody is unequal and there is a sharp divide between the rich and beautiful and those who aren't.  I don't think are favorite, lovable idol, Britney Spears', would be able to survive in the formerly mentioned world.  ......if you believed anything in that second paragraph then this album is for you!  As I said before I'm not forcing you to not buy this album, I am just giving reasons why I think its a poor product and is not recommended unless you really like commercialized bubblegum. +music
Truth+P+Green Day is the largest band in the world right now, the only bad to make the punk rock opera that stormed the world over. people critisize them because they are jealous. They are better and more talented them "Mee-tall-ica" and rap "hustlers" "iz u with ma" (makes no sense) and they're angry cuz they're going strong 18 years now and they are capable of real music. hats to those who had good feedback for this incredible album  Bad critics are jealous too. But of course they'll deny it like all cowards in this world+music
Disappointed - use original+N+I must say I am rather disappointed... however I am not the "target market".  The problem is it is basically the same as original, only played using keyboards and instead of voice you get another track of keyboard.  All the songs are "lullabys" itself as written originally by Smith & co. Therefore my suggestion is get your CD burner and create your compilation for the baby from original CDs. It will do the same job and you will have more fun :) ..as the songs get slightly boring played with keyboard and without the lyrics ;)  My son (slightly &lt;2yrs) already knows the original songs, of course -LOL-, and he does not seem to relate to this more than original. He likes MOBY most of all :D  OK, that is my 2c.  P  P.S. The same is true for Radiohead and Nirvana that I bought as well. P.P.S. I bought many of these for my friends babies and (some) like it a lot.. so YMM+music
Mariah Carey is amazing+P+Mariah Carey is one of the all-time best singers in music history.  Her ability to hit typically unfathomable notes is, of course, her trademark and signature; but unlike some of her contemporaries, especially the late 90s and early 2000s pop stars like Britney Spears, her singing is the reason for her popularity, as it should be for any singer.  Her #1's is a great CD, as are many compilation records by artists because they feature their big hits and not the filler from the actual studio releases.  Impressively, Carey has had an incredible amount of singles but also an amazing number of No. 1's, more than any other female artist and rivaling only The Beatles and Elvis Presley.  Even though #1's is not meant to be a Greatest Hits package (as Carey has said in the enclosed album art) like her official Greatest Hits CD released several years later, it certainly comes off as one.  Mariah's voice remains powerful throughout the years as heard on #1's.  Brilliant--certainly worth purchasing because it compiles the sound that made the 1990s+music
Not impressed+N+Ick. I hated this CD. The first few songs were good, but the rest just sound like a motion picture soundtrack. What a waste of money+music
snooze fest+N+I'm sad to say that Suede has hit rock bottom with "New Morning."  There's just nothing here that moves me. No edge to the music or lyrics that I expect from this band that was so darn good in the early 90's and that desperately tried to carry the torch after Butler left. Brett Anderson's voice sounds pretty good. I just wish they had better songs to show it off. They had mixed success on Coming Up and Head Music but this just falls flat IMO.  If you are planning to sample Suede for the first time after reading or hearing about them I would recommend the Bernard Butler era albums "Suede" and "Dog Man Star". The double album B-sides "Sci Fi Lullabie" is fantastic too and lets you taste great tracks full of promise even after Bernard Butler split+music
Ignore this!+N+actually I meant to write this review for the subsequent album, which I found to be too bland to play more than once.  This one I haven't listened to.  Ooops+music
Some of the best Albert King stuff+P+Agreed - this is some of the best songs I heard Albert play on record.  Truly an excellent collection.  You'll hear not only Albert's awesome soulful singing but also a LOT of intense blues guitar, which is truly "King".  The sound quality leaves more to be desired, but it is acceptable.  Material more than makes up for it.  I played this record to someone who's never heard Albert King's material before and they were shocked.  I'm a fan of Albert King, and this is a valuable disc in my collection+music
Awesome!+P+My favorite cd in the world and the best Dolly cd ever. If you just like good older music and don't like dolly buy this anyway she does the best covers I have ever heard! I love it and would recomend it to anyone! BUY IT WHILE YOU STILL CAN+music
yup+P+just had to give BT some props for a really good cd after bashing his new cd pretty bad. This is a classic in the eletronic music world and much better then any of BT's new stuff I've heard. mmfc+music
2 1/2 stars-- Post punk energy music.+N+Punk, like all great rock music, was a rebellion, in this case against the excesses of the late '60s and early '70s.  BUt somewhere along the way, it was unavoidable that bands would come along that loved the energy and honesty of punk and the very material they were rebelling against-- in the case of XTC, the lush pop and psychedelia of the late '60s.  But these influences were far receeded on their debut album, "White Music" is firmly lodged in the sounds of punk and new wave and is, more than anything else, an album of energy music.  The net result of this is that hte album is inevitably at odds with the strenghts of the band-- songwriters Andy Partridge and Colin Moulding would come later to excel at lush, detailed arrangement full of unerring pop hooks, textures and harmonies, but here, it's all very stripped back, ska and punk influenced pop.  Moulding's trademark slithering bass isn't quite in place yet, though he's already starting to find holes to fit himself in, he primarily forms a solid lockstep with drummer Terry Chambers.  Partridge's guitar, for his part, limits largely to angular punk and ska trends-- loud and aggressive, pushing the music along from the front, which leads Barry Andrews' buzzing organ sound to be largely the soloing voice in the band.  But with all this, the real weakness was singing voices too used to poor microphones of cheap clubs-- Partridge and Moulding both use an unnatural, clipped vocal style that seems more concerned with trying to annunciate than anything else, to the detrimant of the band's sound.  With all of this creating an unnatural tension on the album, it still manages to hit pretty frequently, helped no doubt by the fact that Partridge's songwriting was already top notch.  Standout "Statue of Liberty" best illustrates this-- hints of ska, gentle organ textures, and a funky bassline over which Partridge's clever story of unrequited love can be read out.  Nearly as notable are punky opener "Radios in Motion" (full of crackling punk energy), the loose-yet-detailed arrangement of early single "This is Pop?" (featuring the closest Partridge would ever come to snarling punk rebellion, even if it is laden with great pop hooks), and new wave gem "Atom Age", with just enough of a hint of Brian Wilson to pull it above the rest.  On the other hand, there's a lot of largely forgettable material-- Moulding's songwriting feels like it's not quite ready ("Set Myself on Fire") and his vocal is even more painfully forced than Partridge's ("Cross Wires"), and even Partridge has a couple duds ("Spinning Top").  Add to this an ill-conceived ska take on "All Along the Watchtower" that makes Partridge sound like a bad Hendrix imitator and you end up with a pretty mixed package.  The reissue adds quite a bit to the original-- remastered sound that has the net effect of making the record sound a bit more dated than it probably would at least provides clarity to the music and there's seven bonus tracks-- early singles and the "3D EP".  Most of this stuff is largely forgettable (Moulding's "Heatwave", Partridge's "Dance Band" and "Traffic Light Rock"), but early single "Science Friction" and its b-side "She's So Square" are pulsing full of nervous tension and energy and make a decent listen.  XTC would find enormous heights in the following decade, and I can't help but color my reviews of their early material based on the heights they'd eventually reach.  I have a sneaking suspicion that had I not heard what they'd be capable of in the future, I'd be inclined to give this a much higher rating, but compared to their later work, "White Music" sounds positively amateurish.  It's got its moments, but they'd go on to do a lot better+music
A Big Disappointment+N+Perhaps I was expecting too much, but I thought this set was a big letdown. In addition to the points brought up by some of the other reviewers (missing tracks, songs out of sequence, etc.), I thought the sound quality was anything but excellent. I could see some of the recordings from the 30s sounding weak, but there is no excuse for those from the 40s and 50s sounding as poor as they do. I have a ton of 40s recordings and very few sound as bad as these do. Hell, I have 78s that sound better. It's a shame as I really like the Sons of the Pioneers, but for good quality cowboy recordings going to have to stick with Riders in the Sky until some one comes up with a better set than this+music
Not the best example of the genre.+N+The Planets seem to have a problem deciding what they'l be.  Are they a band that puts a rock twist on classical?  Are they a bloated chamber orchestra?  Are they a rather sparse symphony?  What is on this album is a good example of mediocrity.  If you want good poppy classical music, check out Vanessa Mae.  If you want good classical music, look at the scores of albums arranged by truly great composers.  The Planets try hard and fall flat.  Perhaps in another couple of albums they'll have found their voice, but it certainly isn't on Classical Graffit+music
Great album+P+This was one of those impromptu buys.  Hadn't ever heard of her before, just liked the clips and said, "why not?"  There isn't a single bad song on here, so how often does that happen?  She's a screamer for sure, but it's still melodic and not too downtrodden.  Her range of styles is impressive, too.  Not too many screamers can do the ballads so well :-+music
yeah!+P+Who said you need a lot of songs on a CD to have a good record??? This has already got 7 thrashy metal songs from one of metal's finest! If you are new to Slayer, I recommend getting all their early stuff first - or even just that+music
Perhaps their best?+P+I was fortunate enough to be at the CD release concert for this album last night at the Birchmere in Alexandria, VA last night, EfO's home turf.  They performed pretty much all the songs on the CD (only leaving out "No Pain, No Problem) with some of the older songs sprinkled throughout.    And even after hearing all the songs, we still played the CD in the car on the way home.    If you're a fan of EfO already, you probably own this CD already.  If you're new to the band, either this CD or any of their two live CD's (Portable EfO Show and Three Rooms) would be a good place to start.  Or, better yet, get all three.  There is not one weak song on the entire CD.  Standouts include "When the Rain Crashed Down," "Baltimore," the title track, "Walk Humbly, Son" and really, the rest of the album. +music
Great Songs - Poor Recording Quality+N+Although the song titles are great, the music sounds very flat. these songs are all likely original recordings. If you want to hear the original sound and imagine your stereo systems as one of those old horn-type record players, you'll love this CD. Otherwise, find something else+music
He's just as bad as the people he patronizes+N+I hate to condemn records I bought.  Mainly because it's a confession that I've wasted my money on bad art.  &quot;Sail Away&quot; is bad, and could have been worse except for a few good songs:  &quot;Last night I had a dream&quot;, &quot;Simon Smith..&quot;, &quot;Political Science&quot;, &quot;Memo to my son&quot;, &amp; &quot;Dayton Ohio - 1903&quot;.  The rest are as near to awful as you can get. Good lyricist?  I don't think so.  Besides his awful attacks on touchy subjects, his phrasing is always typical, and his rhyming hardly goes as far as rhyming &quot;me&quot; with &quot;be&quot;.  I already had &quot;Good old boys&quot; (decent), and the songs on &quot;Sail Away&quot; were practically ripped right off of the former album.  The music is almost always unlively (simple piano chords); hardly the riveting stuff I usually listen to. This is a big scar in my music collection+music
My daughter gives it a five!!+P+A must have for any 7 - 14 year old!  If they love High School Musical, they will love this+music
Clever and Cute+P+JS has a very pretty if rather small voice. Her lyrics are smart and different. Songs are catchy. I'm surprised none of the tracks from Pink Pearl were hits. She's a good singer-songwriter who deserves more recognition. Check her out+music
Motifs by Paris Combo+P+This group is very consistent.  This CD is as good as their others.  I can't wait to see them in concert in San Francisco in October+music
This is a really good CD!!!!+P+I love this CD! Since I am reading the book and have watched several movies, this musical means a lot to me. When I finally relized who was singing this and who was singing that and why they were singing it etc, etc, I enjoyed it even more! At once, I put it on my ipod and listen to it constantly.    Jean Valjean is my favourite singer on this cd. But then, of course, he is my favorite character of all times in the book. I espeicialy like the songs "Bring Him Home" and "What Have I Done?" The one song I don't care for is the final song. I know this sounds silly, but I cry almost every time I hear it. Eponine is my second favorite. Well, she ties with Enjrolas that is. If I were to be in this musical I would like to play her part. Her voice is strong but soft at the same time. Of all the songs she sings, I like "A Little Fall of Rain" the best. Enjrolas is really good too. This would bring me to more of my favorite songs. "Red and Black" and "Do You Hear The People Sing?"    My final conclusion must be this: I love this CD. Please, if buy this CD, cherish it. It had GREATLY impacted my life. This CD is GREAT! You can see just what I'm talking about! Perhaps this feeling that this is the best musical only belongs to me. But then again.............+music
Switching Instruments+N+Coleman's play on different instruments showed a lot of skill, but the music seemed to lose some of its spontaneity in the process.  The jazz represented to me a kind of neo-be-bop that lacked lyrical luster and moving harmonies.  jw+music
Rather tedious+N+This music is excellent within the film. As a stand-alone work, it's boring. It sounds like video game background music. Some music works solely as incidental to the scenes in the film and this is the case with 300.   Excellent film - uninspired soundtrack+music

Stick to R&B!+P+Tyreese will always get 5 stars from me when it comes to singing. However, the last thing we need is another rapper out there rapping about the same thing. Tyreese has a sexy, sensual, and pleasant singing voice that's very pleasing to the ears, but with the rapping it just sounds like he's trying too hard to prove that he can rap. Then again, this review may be a little biased because I'm not used to that side of Tyreese. I just don't see him in that light, as a lyricist instead of a vocalist. I'm sorry, Tyreese will always be a singer/actor and not a rapper to me. I think that's why he made it a double disc set because he knew that everyone would just buy the R & B disc, but nobody would buy the rap disc+music
Excellent Work+P+This release from Delerium is pretty much there most polished up & edited cd to date. It is good. Although I feel it is not there best, it is nice to hear the 2 members working together again. I give it 5 stars. Buy it+music
Why does it have to be one or the other?+P+The concerns raised about Phair's last two album are hardly palatable.  The general concensus seems to be that either:  1) She's a total sell-out, angry rock was her only voice 2) She's way better than she used to be, softer is good  Why does it have to be one or the other?  People say she's losing her tough edge, some say she's got a new bead on life.  I don't see this as being one type of music or the other.  I see a great songwriter and passionate person going with what makes her happy - not resentful music for the reality-impared outsider or love music for the overly-sappy contemporary, but well produced, thoughtful works of art that refect something different with each release.  I'm not saying that this is "The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan" or anything, but it's also miles from Britney Spears.    Phair's music has always been just that - Phair's music.     So if it's not what you like, get over it.  It's not about you.  It never has been.  If you don't believe me check out her ITunes Original Album.  And play on Liz, play on+music
The Shepp To Get!+P+As an earlier review states, Shepp tended to have some dead spots on his  earlier releases. This on cooks from start to finish (which includes two  great tracks from his &quot;Kwanza&quot; lp). The addition of piano makes  this set his most accessable impulse cd. The piano reinforces the feeling  of the blues which as always been present with Shepp, but here there is no  denying it. HIghlights include &quot;Frnkenstein&quot; and  &quot;Bakai.&quot+music
Get this First+P+If you want to check out Beth, get this one first - she has since lost the edge ...  and also a great guitarist in Jimmy!!+music
A FLAWLESS CD+P+Patty Loveless's work in the 80s and 90s was exceptional (It is a shame that she shifted to bluegrass (Maybe because she can't get any airplay on country stations? Which favors stuff like Faith Hill, who can't even carry Patty's microphone.).As for this CD, it is exceptional, you cannot get much better on a single disk than this (Maybe Toby Keith's Greatest Hits 2?). Songs like "I Think About Elvis", "Lonely Too Long", "Blame It On Your Heart". "Here I Am", and "How Can I Help You Say Goodbye?" (A real heartwrenching song, and this is from an alpha male), are country classics. And the rest of the CD does not have a weak song either. Patty Loveless blows away just about any other female country singer since Patsy Cline with the exception of Sherrie Austin (Another singer who cannot get airplay). There is beauty, humor, sadness, and most of all INTELLIGENCE in her music. Patty is country for people who love intelligent, well thought out, and original lyrics. I would highly recommend getting this CD, then go out an get her "Greatest Hits" CD for material such as "Timber" and "Chains" (That CD also gets 5 stars, but is a little weaker). Simply put this is a flawless CD+music
Their best+P+One fierce beer coaster is without a doubt the bloodhound gang's best album.Some of the best songs are "Why's everbody always pickin' on me?","It's tricky","Fire water burn" and "I wish I was queer so I could get chicks".This album is a classic that should be owned by any fan.Buy it now+music
intergallactic beats+P+Mix master mike has really worked on his beats this time. i give him props for that. what i miss is like a scratch-theme in each track like dj revolution, dj premier are doing using acapellas and making own lyrics, sentences with it. Overall the album is ok, but not a classic.      +music
What happened to Louie?!+N+Listen... i dont know why they put the 5 star reviews up front (probaly to make him look good and cause they problay wrote reviews first) but if you ACTUALLY listen to this type of music,  this cd really IS an insult.  If you think Sandstorm is the greatest thing ever made, then YOUR an insult to us listeners.  The First Dance cd i ever bought was infact a Louie Devito CD.  NYC Underground 3.  I LOVED IT!  Me and my friends worshipped that CD and couldnt wait till NYC 4 cameout.  But as time went on and we really got into dance music... we figured out that Devito just takes the top hits from ANY category and crams them onto a CD.  I mean common!... Stacie Orrico!??!  Then people who only hear these songs in clubs or on the radio think hes the king because hes got them on his CD.  Do yourself a favor and DONT follow CD stores 1-10 top hits concerning Dance, techno, trance and so on.  Oh yeah.. and dont buy the cd.  its sad+music
I'm not gay but ........+P+I LOVE this CD set!  Great selection of songs, guaranteed to get you on your feet and moving+music
Highly recommended+P+This is definately one of the best live albums that I have heard. It rocks from beginning to end. This is the way that Blues Traveler need to be heard.....they are a terrific jam band and this double album shows them off to perfection. 2 new songs are also showcased here, &quot;Regarding Steven&quot; and &quot;Closing down the park&quot;. The booklet contains tons of photos and the lyrics to the two new songs. This album is a must for all Blues Traveler fans+music
1 star for Remastered  - 5 stars for original+N+Who remastered it?  It sure wasn't Bob; find the UNremastered CD if you can.  Or better yet, - the original LP is absolutely amazing.  This remastered version is a record company trying to tell you it is "New and Improved" when it is neither.  For the best experience in appreciating Bob Marley and what he accomplished, read a biography, then listen to all the ORIGINAL albums.  Here are some of my favorite Bob Marley songs that are NOT usually on any best list:  Heathen, Small Axe, Who the Cap Fit, War, Get Up Stand Up, Johnny Was, Duppy Conqueror, Cry To Me, One Foundation.    If I was forced to pick his best song it would probably be "War."  Even though he didn't write the words and it is largely spoken, it is extremely powerful+music
Oud Great!+P+By chance,I saw the trio perform at the Monterey World Music festival in 2002.  The music starts out fairly slow, almost boring.  After a few songs, the pulse of the one drum, the melody of the oud and clarinet really started to be hypnotic. At the end of the set the crowd gave the trio a standing ovation. I bought the CD and played it for a friend who thinks it is great 'massage' music.  It is very soothing, relaxing, mysterious music that calms the mind+music
Stay clear unless you are REALLY SQUARE...+N+yikes... way, waY WAY  to slick and over produced... Its all just like muzak really.  Stay clear unless you are REALLY SQUARE..+music
Totally Unsurpassed Film-Score Music!+P+This dual CD set unambiguously deserves many more stars than just a puny five!  I have heard none finer.  And only a few CDs of equal quality.  The legendary Miklos Rozsa is the film's composer.  This is the inaugural release of Rozsa's complete score for the 1959 film BEN HUR (BH).  The CDs contain 88 tracks in the same order as in the composer's original score.  By "complete," I mean there is more music here than there was actually in the film.  This is because the CDs include unedited cues and music from film outtakes plus one alternative track.  The vast majority of tracks were recorded on the M-G-M sound stage with sizable orchestras of up to 75 performers.  The result is sound of intense richness, but not to the point where ensembles over whelmed individual instruments (of which there were quite a few "unusual" ones).   Not surprisingly, Rozsa won an Academy Award for BH (his third).  While you can debate which of Rozsa's score is his best (my personal favorite is his music for the 1947 film THE RED HOUSE), there is no debate over the undisputed fact that ALL his 90 or so film composition are simply (or very close to) magnificent.  The CD booklet is over-the-top outstanding, and easily the most extensive ever created.  More of a book than a booklet, it's authors, Marilee Bradford (Ms. Bradford is also produced the CD set) and the late Tony Thomas, have provided us with a definitive source of reference.  Rozsa was probably the only composer of his time who could create the score for BH.  This CD set is probably the only recording of our time that demands to be in your collection.       William Flanigan, Ph.D+music
mmmm+P+this is john mclaughlin and mils davis at their finest. Before miles went fully into fusion, this "jazz-rock" is quite exquisite. SUPERB+music
Was sent as a present+P+All I can say is that the product was sent on time with no hassle.  The person I gave it to was quite pleased! +music
Tough going+N+Reading this novel was slow going.  As a guy, I found the lack of action stultifying, and the flashes of humor were too quaint for me to derive any pleasure from them.  The answer to the book's primary riddle--who shall Emma marry?--becomes obvious early on, and everything else is just a tedious pairing off until that riddle is expressly answered.  There's a bit of local and historical color, but rarely does the narrative rise above the description of, say, a summer outing.  Not one of Jane Austen's best+music
Rough in the Diamond+N+Being an avid Neil Diamond fan I was anxious to get this CD. However; the songs are uninspired, unremarkable and banal. A huge disappointment+music
I Am+P+If you don't have this CD, and you are thinking of buying it, think no more. This is another classic CD from EW&F+music
I don't get it ... why remaster a masterpiece?+P+Nobody's reviewed the remastering yet.  It's hard for me to imagine improving on the original CD.  I'm an audio geek with mixing panel seat time mastering indy music and radio shows.  I have a high-end audio system, on which Letter from Home in its original release needed no improvement, as far as I can hear.  So why remaster Letter from Home?  Can anybody help us understand how it's better?????  Pat, if you're reading this, howzabout releasing a DVD from live shows during the Letter from Home time period?  I have all your CDs and DVDs but while CDs fill up an entire shelf of my CD collection, all the DVDs fit in one hand...+music
Bah...+N+There's really not much reason to buy this album.  A year before this was released, Mannheim released an album called "Halloween," which was a two-disc set, with one disc featuring music (mostly Mannheim arrangements of "scary" classical pieces like "Hall Of The Mountain King," plus a few rehases of old Fresh Aire tunes), and the other disc featured spooky sound effects.  "Monster Mix" takes samplings from that two-disc set and gives you the abridged version on one disc for a couple of dollars less.  They also threw in "Full Moon", which was first released on their "Ambience Series" album, "Autumn Song."  Incidentally, I like their "Autumn Song" album quite a bit better than either "Halloween" or "Monster Mix," but you can only get it directly through Mannheim's official website.  For those who aren't familiar with the tracks on this disc-- some of the tracks are decent, though none reached the quality of music that Mannheim put out back in the late 80s/early 90s.  Synthesizers always played a heavy role in Mannheim's music, but here, they get a bit overbearing and everything starts to sound a bit cheap and over-quantized (in other words, it all feels like it was machine generated-- which, I suppose, it was.)    Still, if you like the Steamroller sound, and you want to hear them attempt a holiday other than Christmas, you may find this interesting for a couple of listens.  But then, just pay the extra dollar or two and get the full double-disc set called "Halloween."  Better yet, go to their website (mannheimsteamroller.com) and try "Autumn Song."           +music
Magnificent!+P+Bought this CD when I was in Australia and I fell in love with it from the first time i listend to it. A mix that will blow your mind, MoS has done it again - a record worth every cent. Get it, you wont be disappointed+music
the only current pop band i like!+P+most music i listen to wouldn't sound anything like this.  my idea of a good time is listening to mogwai at full volume or bumping hip hop with a lot of bass.  of montreal are incredible.  the bass lines are ridiculously funky.  i didn't think i liked this cd as much as their other work, but after listening to it 10 times i can't get it out of my head.  i usually prefer lyrics that aren't as literal as this, but it works really well.  there's so many good songs 'but which one do i, do i cho-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oose'.  really, i don't know what the best song is, because all of the songs are either a 9-10.  'gronladic edit' is nothing short of brilliant.  the transistion from tracks 2 and 3 is one of my favorite moments.  handclaps cheesy?  i think not!  this music puts me in a really good mood.  and it's psychedelic in the best way possible.  it's like listening to i don't know, the cars/beach boys/zappa/beatles/dust brothers at the same time. +music
The New Rhapsody - Excellent Epic Symphonic Metal+P+No you're not seeing things. It is Rhapsody in all their excess and you know what? It sounds pretty good. Not sure of the reason for the name change but it seems to have made them less hyper and more melodious (if that's possible). Plenty of medieval melodies, soaring vocals, backing choirs and of course, bombast.   Not unlike Luc Turilli's two new separate releases sans the female lead vocalists, but not quite as good. For fans of Therion, Dreamquest, Epica+music
One of my best cds+P+The title track "Mercy, Mercy, Mercy," alone, is enough reason to buy this album.  This recording captures the electricity of this particular show to the extent that the listener may at points truly get a feeling like they're sitting in the room with the band+music
Definitely not an original band+N+I bought this cd cuz i love the black betty tune...w/great expectation i figured their other material was gonna blow me away...wrong...Ram Jam should have named themselves  Rip-OFF Jam....after listening to this cd i have concluded that they didnt't have an original bone in their bodies...the songs were a mishmash of  blatant allman/skynyrd/blackfoot attempts...the vocals were  without energy or feel...i can understand why they wernt sucessful where others were+music
Neu! - 'Neu! '75' (Astralwerks)+P+Rother and Dinger parted ways for a couple of years before putting out the duo's third release.&quot;Heros&quot; sounds,to me like what MAY'VE influenced Gary Numan's early work.&quot;E-Musik&quot; is a seven minute,nice hypnotic/floating track.As &quot;After Eight&quot; progresses with it's laid back piano and mystic like vocals MORE than prove that Neu! really was ahead of their time,so does &quot;See Land&quot;. &quot;Isi&quot; could become a hit,if played in the right clubs.Dug the punk-like vocals.I always thought that that Neu! was strictly instrumental.&quot;Leb Wohl&quot; is an offbeat experimental piece that starts out with weird,but very cool sound effects,then turns into a punk song.Pretty much as mind blowing as Neu!'s first album.According to the liner notes,Rother plays guitar,piano,synth and electronics..Dinger provides the percussion,guitar,organ,vocals and keyboards.Never has one heard so much brain damaging pleasure coming from JUST two musicians+music
Hmmmm, that's all I can say...+N+This was my first time listening to Gaelle and all I can say is "Hmmmmm"....This CD was depressing to me, all the beats were down beat. This CD would be a great buy for someone who is always in a somber mood and never has an optimistic outlook on life.+music
THERES NO LOMBARDO WAH WAH WAH+P+Its sinful that such a great album doesnt have a 5 star average. This is quality thrash metal right here, with a slightly refined sound to it. All the songs have blistering solos, crazy as hell riffs, and of course, Paul Bostaphs inhuman drumming, which brings me to another a point. PAUL BOSTAPH IS JUST AS GOOD AS DAVE LOMBARDO YOU F-ING RETARDS!!!!!! GET IT THROUGH YOUR F-ING SKULLS.   Sorry, I had to get that out. But seriously, just listen to the crazy intro to Killing Fields, his crazy pummeling in Dittohead, and his double bass madness in SS-3. This is Slayer, quality Slayer, and all the b-chin needs to stop. Im betting about half of you who are trashing this album havent even listened to it, like the retards reviewing Trivium and Unearth. If your like those Sepultura and Anthrax fans who refuse to move out of the 80s and early 90s, than so be it. Your loss.  As for me, my favorite tracks are Killing Fields, SS-3, Mind Control, 213, and Dittohead.  If my review has convinced you to have a positive attitude about change, get Diabolus in Musica, this, and God Hates Us All. Also get some of Pauls work with Exodus, Forbidden, and Testament if you need further proof of his excellency+music
A change of direction for the Great JT+P+Like most of JT's work, this album contains easy listening soft rock.  It marked a change of direction for JT in that it lacks the introspective, personal quality of his earlier albums.  Still, it contains some very good music, backed up by some of the greatest musicians around, including Graham Nash, David Crosby, Carly Simon, Randy Newman, and saxophone master David Sanbourn.  Like always, it has JT's beautifully sweet voice and laid back six string accoustic guitar.    Several classic hits came out of the album including the "Mexico" and "How Sweet it is to be Loved by You."  Like much of JTs work, it reminds me of the easy comfort of waking up to diffuse sunlight on a Sunday morning+music
Still Alive & Well+N+The album is too short, mainly due to the duration of each song. Only 12 titles. Need to review personal objectives prior to purchasing+music
Driver's Seat+N+Where the heck is Sniff n' The Tears' "Driver's Seat" in this soundtrack.  It plays at a definite changing point in the movie where Floyd comes to tell Jack that he needs to switch to video instead of film.  It's a travesty that this song wasn't included.  But a good soundtrack nonetheles+music
The Musical Highlight Is Missing+N+I have to agree with Greg Ippolito's review.  The album is simply incomplete without Dirk Diggler's "You Got The Touch."  The most significant musical moment in the film.  Hard to believe it's not on Volume 2 either.  A shame+music
great music, horrible sound+N+Ken Burns and company have assembled some classic Parker takes, but the sound quality is dismal. Yes, we know these recordings were made before the advent of tape, etc.--I don't think most people interested in Parker recordings are looking for pristine studio sound, but this is a disgrace. I have many C.P. recordings, including lots of old Verve and Savoy issues on LP--none of them sound as bad as this CD. Not just surface noise, but actual musical distortion that could have been mitigated with today's technology. I was suckered into this one by the Burns affiliation, since I had enjoyed the TV jazz series. Not a fraction of the care put into that effort was expended on the CD. There is so much Parker out there today put out with more care; I would look to the Dial and Savoy sessions, for example+music
The best of? Not really.+N+This album doesn't offer "The best of Scooter" Only the best after 1998. All the previous singles like "Move your Ass" "Back In the UK" "Fire" and "The Age of Love" are not present here. It's a allright album for starters but personally I think that the music they made from 1994-1999 was the best and many of those songs are not here, while lots of newer one's that doesn't offer you the true sound of Scooter that are here aren't very good. I own "Rough & Tough & Dangerous: 94-98" that does include some of the classics and it also offers you some wonderful instrumental trance songs that really proves the genius of this band (We don't see that very often anymore though). While songs like "How Much is the Fish" "I'm your Pusher" "Call me Manana" and "We are the greatest" are all great songs you can find them on "No time to Chill" instead, other then that, get the album I recommended instead of this that isn't really their "Best of" anyway+music
Found Some Good Gospel Bluegrass+P+This was released "way back" in 1991, so I was not sure what I would find. Anyways, I was pleasantly surprised and out of the 24 songs, there were 9 that I gave 5 stars and downloaded to my MP3 player. That's a pretty good average for a single CD! Many of the selections were unique in that they were not "new" versions of old songs.+music
Bridal make-over music+N+Duet featuring Barbra and the scabrous vocal stylings of Bryan Adams is the perfect background music for a bridal make-over segment on Oprah. Like other Streisand albums of late, it's overly lush and sentimental. Sometimes  love does this to people+music
1990: 10 years into Maidens career.. content start to crack.+P+Records 'Iron Maiden' through '7th Son' were incredible to me!   Then came NPFTD, same cool art, content tho started to drop-off. Many of these tracks are simply sub-par & boring.   1- Tailgunner- Nice, upbeat, moving, enjoyable.  2- Holy Smoke-  not exactly the excellent style of IM but still not too bad.  3- No Prayer For The Dying- eh, slow but speeds up with classic Maiden electric duets 4- Public Enema Number One- Nothing groundbreaking here but fast & true to old content 5- Fates Warning -BORING! long slow intro & should have not made it to release. Poor! 6- The Assassin - slightly better than average.  7- Running Silent, Running Deep- filler although.. the solo's are really nice 8- Hooks in you- Nice, could have fit well on their debut with D'anno 9- Bring Your Daughter... To The Slaughter - Not my type of material. Never liked it.  10. Mother Russia- dont really like it till the end where is really changes into a fast guitar fest.   Overall not that bad.. the follow-up fear of the dark was a clear step down & then after that they hit rock bottom & have not come back. X-factor to Matter of Life & Death are just a near complete collapse of decent writing.  +music
Hmmmmmm.........+N+It's nice to see that some listeners are passionate about this album. 'Sulk' was recommended to me by a internet friend that turned me on to Modern Eon (FANTASTIC) - I took a chance thinking I had missed another fantastic 80's band - well....in this case, I didn't.....  This is typical and easy to forget (thank heaven) sickly sweet and drippy 80's synth pop.  This isn't synth pop like later New Order, Ultravox, Ministry's first album or even the Naked Eyes or Tears for Fears....this is Synth pop like something in the background of a low budget 80's teen sex comedy 'new wave' bar scene.... - I will say it's a hair better then anything Wang Chung ever did but only because the singing is so over the top that I actually was cracking up a couple of times with the vocal embellishments and pretention....+music
The reviewers were right-this IS beautiful!+P+I loved the movie, but the music may even be better. My friends think so too, everybody who heard it. Look, if you liked the movie's music, and are reading the reviews to figure out if it is worth buying or not, then take  my word for it, IT IS! It has all kinds of tracks: mostly chilly and dark,  but also some narcotic-sounding slow ones (good for dancing) and a few  brutal ones. I really recommend it, it is one of the best CDs I have. If  you are feeling sad, depressed, angry or if you just had enough, this is  the music to listen to. Buy this, it is essential for your collection+music
R.I.P.  Dime+N+I have nothing but the upmost respect for Vinnie Paul.  It eats me up that he chose this project as his comeback to music.  I can't think of a musician that wouldn't have jumped at the chance to be in a band with him. (Zakk Wylde, Maynard James Keynan, hell even Matt Heafy are a few names that come to mind) I respect what Mudvanye does.  They have a formula. Not exactly my cup of tea, but it works and it sells records.  So why this collaboration? why now?  I can't figure it out.  Glen Tribot and (insert nothingface guitarist name here) are not even in Dimebag's shadow.  Their riffing doesn't do Vin's playing any justice and it shows right off the bat.  The only part of this album where I hear any real connection is when Vinnie is playing the snare and high hat in 4/4.  Terrible waste of such an amazing talent.  As for the vocals... some of the screaming works, nothing special, just kinda sounds like Mudvayne.  But on the slower country influenced songs, I fight every urge to smash this cd into a million pieces.  Vinnie Paul, please find yourself musicians at your skill level and leave the amaeturs in your wake...  If you like Mudvayne and enjoyed Damageplan... you will still probably be disapointed with this cd.  If you are expecting Pantera, as some of these reviews will lead you to believe.. well go throw on Trendkill and feel privelaged that you were   able to experience metal at its finest.                     +music
Not bad at all.. fills in historical gaps in JB catalog+P+You will love this CD if you love James Brown, the JBs, Maceo, Bobby Byrd, Hank Ballard or any of the incredible musicians in their orbit during their late 1960s-early '70s heyday.   Bottom line: It fills in gaps left in previous comps. It includes some rare historic moments. A few of the most notable:  It starts with an oddly slowed, "rock" original version of "Talkin' Loud and Sayin' Nothin'" that evokes the stoned, slovenly funk crawl later adopted by Sly Stone in his "Riot" era. It's not especially good, but it's an intriguing opener to this lovably obscure odd-lot compilation.  Hank Ballard telling fellow Blacks that they won't get any respect if they don't get rid of their "processed," or straightened (usually with lye) hairstyle, a remnant from the just-past "Negro" days. Hank says he used to wear a process but now has chosen, as a political statement, to wear a "natural" Afro, one more suitable for a beautiful Black brother or sister. (In a delicious touch of irony, backing vocals for this black empowerment anthem are provided by The Dapps, the lone all-white group signed to James Brown Productions.)  Then you have Brother Bobby Byrd "Doin' The Do," a long jam that is essentially a predecessor (recorded at the Olympia Theatre in Paris!) of the JB's mesmerizing and legendary 16-minute "Escape-ism"/"Make It Funky" jam on the ridiculously essential 1971 Apollo live disc, A Revolution Of The Mind. "Catfish" Collins, brother of Bootsy, works overtime on the funky guitar.  You also have a pissed-off JB, feeling robbed by a few Average White Band songs, trying to outdo The Man at his own game once again. In trying to create a Top 40 instrumental over the backing track of an old song ("Hot Pants Road"), he fails, but instead he creates a funky, almost "Superfly" soundtrack vibe that could have come from the opening music for a Quinn Martin Productions TV cop show of the '70s.  And you've some of the great, criminally underrated female vocalists in the JB stable: Lyn Collins (in a fiery "Giveit Up") and Vicki Anderson. You have just about every great musician of JB's funk era represented here as well.  Maybe this isn't the most essential JB compilation ever, but don't dismiss it so quickly. More than just another CD, this album is a powerful reminder of one undisputed fact. Social historians, musical archivists, scholars and others will spend the next 150 years just listening to and cataloguing the records the Hardest Working Man in Show Business was at one time able to make as easily and effortlessly as paper airplanes on a lazy afternoon.  Instead of these piecemeal comps, Polydor needs to just drop a 95-disc box set of every known JB recording, with maybe a holographic soul sister research archivist (wearing HOT PANTS, no doubt) to help you sort through it all.   This would be one of the discs on that set; it's not the most incendiary of them, but it is another piece of the vast and beautiful mosaic created for us by James Brown and these amazing musicians over a period of decades. +music

Barenaked music+P+Typical country rock slash pop american music and weal vocals stick to the acting the woman whohad a hit with "bitch" back in 1997 cam back to dissapoint us al+music
Ella and Louis sing of life as we know it--and wow, how I appreciate the ride!!!+P+On this CD Ella and Louis Armstrong join forces to make an album that is pure magic. They've been lovingly teased as satin (Ella) and sandpaper (Louis, because of his gravelly voice); but no duo compares to them when they sing together. Louis and Ella obviously enjoyed making this recording; their voices are in excellent form and impart a certain sense of genuine happiness that is hard to find. Ella and Louis have voices that are rich, vibrant and full of electricity! This CD proves it.  The CD starts off with the charming and playful "Let's Call The Whole Thing Off." The album then switches gears and goes into the more soulful love ballad entitled "Our Love Is Here To Stay." Sublime! Other great songs on this CD include "Stars Fell On Alabama;" "The Nearness Of You;" "Stompin' At The Savoy;" and "Tenderly." Louis performs great trumpet solos on songs including "Tenderly" and "Summertime" that make your heart melt. In fact, every song is special on this CD; I also admire their rendition of "Under A Blanket Of Blue."   The musical arrangements are very well done. These tracks feature several great opportunities for us to enjoy Armstrong's trumpet solos.   The liner notes impress me, too. There is an adaptation of an essay by William Ruhlmann who wrote the liner notes for The Complete Ella And Louis On Verve. There are beautiful photos of Ella and Louis; and you get the song credits, too. A nice plus!  Overall, the chemistry between Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong makes for an experience that is truly in its own league. They enjoy their work and it shows. You will appreciate their energy and powerful renditions of these wonderful songs. I highly recommend this CD for fans of classic pop vocals and fans of both Ella and Louis. This is also a great budget priced CD for people who want to know if they will like this style of music.   Moreover, if you do like this CD I suggest you listen to the CD box set entitled The Complete Ella Fitzgerald & Louis Armstrong and another CD entitled Ella and Louis again. You can also try solo CDs by both Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong; they produced great music individually as well. You truly can't go wrong with this classic CD; and I hope this CD brings you the same joy and thrills that Ella and Louis communicate when they perform these magnificent songs.  ENJOY!!!+music
I'm surprised that this album is so underated.+P+A lot of people prefer blue lines over protection and I just don't understand that. I found protection to be great. Possibly one of the best CDs that Massive attack has ever released other than Mezzanine. Eurochild is mindblowingly amazing. Karmacoma, Better things, Heat Miser, weather storm and spying glass are also exceptional. The only reason I don't give this a 5 star rating is cause of the last track. A cover of the Doors, Light my fire that, to me, seems very pointless. +music
Music to take a bullet to+N+The only thing I got out of listening to the title track, Protection, is fleeting remembrances of the movie The Bodyguard.  This was not a good film.  I am a great admirer of Tracey Thorne's voice and, as I said elsewhere, would listen to her sing the phone book; but this is not the phone book.  This is teenage emotionalizing.  Though I resonate with the idea of self-sacrifice, the whole point of self-sacrifice is to actually DO it, not to talk about how you would or should or might do it should the situation arise.  The track is basically like listening to somebody saying, &quot;You know, I'd like totally run in front of a bus to save somebody, knowwhamsain?&quot;  The whole point of self-sacrifice is that it is difficult to do.  It certainly is not difficult to talk about doing, though.  I don't know Tracey Thorne, but I am not really uplifted by the thought of her hypothetically jumping in front of someone to take a bullet for them+music

Motorik Masterwork, wunderbar!!!!+P+An ELECTRIC AUTOBAHN towards the infinite... be carefull, this is veeeeeeery trippy stuff..+music
A Sad Ending for Eagles+N+I picked this album up, expecting the same level of quality as past Eagles albums (such as the thrilling Desperado), however, it seems the only quality songs on this album are the hits, which can be just as easily obtained by purchasing the Hits Volume II, a much better album. The rest of the album is lame and uninspired, and is ultimately not worth your money+music
Best metal band to come along in a while...+P+They're sort of a throwback: speed metal combined with elements of 70's metal, and combine to make a killer sound.  I saw these guys live, they're even better in person than on the album.  They have a very tight, defined sound that chugs along until you head moves in unison, they have a lot of variety in their riffs (although it's still essentially speed metal, so they don't go too crazy with variety) with head pounding vocals.  When you play this, turn up the volume, you won't be sorry.  My best attempt at a comparison would be this: combine Metallica's "Ride the Lightning" with Sabbath's "Master of Reality" and throw in a little Zeppelin, and that's about what you'll get with The Sword.  A great up and coming metal band.  I can't stop playing this album. +music
Virtuoso Guitar Playing, Complex Musical Structures!+N+Here we go again....another tortured collection of three chord, twelve barre Delta Blues. In truth, these songs were redundant and whiny when the very limited Robert Johnson first recorded them; now hearing Clapton ressurect them is just plain annoying. How many times can we hear "I woke up this morning, baby; My cow just up and died.....da dum, da dum, da dum.....I woke up this morning, baby. My cow just up and died. Da dum, da dum, da dum.... So I drank a bottle of hooch and I began to cry....da dum, da dum, da dum...." Come on, people! If this is genius songwriting and guitar playing then we should all simply throw in the towel on civilization. When Eric Clapton plays Cole Porter, Duke Ellington, and Rogers and Hart on his guitar---unaccompanied----chords, melody and bass line----like Django Reinhardt, Wes Montgomery, and Joe Pass----then maybe I'll consider him a great guitarist. Today's youth are clueless about almost everything, and guitar virtuosity is no exception. I don't believe Clapton has ever heard of key modulation, arpeggios, or chord substitutions. In truth, he is an average rock guitarist, and considering the primative structure of rock and roll guitar playing, that's not saying much. For anyone to call him a great guitarist, let alone the greatest guitarist whoever lived, is indicative of either juvenile delinquency or just plain stupidity. It's like saying Madonna is the greatest singer of all time. Odds are those who make such vacuous, ludicrous statements are the children or grandchildren of the druggie Woodstock generation who wouldn't know a great guitarist if he/she tripped over him (which would be likely since they were all drugged out of their minds most of the time). I know we're living in the age of grand mediocrity, but enough is enough. Go buy a Wes Montgomery, Django Reinhardt or Barney Kessel album and listen to sophisticated, nuanced, and soulful guitar viruosity. If you have half a brain, you'll throw away your collection of rock guitar icons and beg foregiveness for being such an uneducated, unsophisticated nitwit who once claimed that one-dimensional druggies like Clapton and Hendrix were great guitarists. If after listening to these truly talented guitarists who actually play more than three chords you still hold to your position that Clapton is a great guitarist, here's what you do: pick up your Fender Strat, turn the amp volume up to 10, smoke a joint, and go stick your head between your distortion chambers and fuzz boxes and make a lot of noise and pretend you too are a great guitarist. Eric Clapton is a great guitarist! What a dumb society we have wrought since the late 1960s.+music
You can go far if you have no talent.+N+The Sweet Escape by Gwen Stefani is unoriginal, shallow, and the most pathetic album of 2006. First of all, she can't sing, she can't write and she needs to go back to where she came from, No Doubt. When she was with that band, the songs were halfway decent and the guys in the band rocked, not her. The only reason she got famous because she liked to show her nasty looking stomach off and she was dating a popular musician at the time who would later become her husband. Well honey, you are a nobody and hopefully people will come to their senses and realize the same thing as well. Don't waste your money on this garbage, if you want a real singer then check-out some real Garbage, Shirley Manson instead+music
no 30 sec amazon preview.+N+5 versions of the same song and amazon doesn't have the 30 sec preview of any of them. sooo it's an import ??? where is the international version of the music video?+music
Meh+N+First off...the Pink Spiders are in no way punk. Secondly, this music is so polished and poppy it lacks any type of genuine feeling to it. Third, the whole "pink" gimmick can only take you so far...even Pink had to change her hair color.   I guess for fans of pop music this band will make you excited, but for me it just makes me ill+music
Love Reba!+P+I'm not a huge country fan but Reba McEntire is great! She's an amazing musician! This album has a great collection of songs on it! My favorites are "You Lie," "For My Broken Heart," and "Is There Life Out There." Super album...highly recommended!+music
F U R M +N+After seeing Reba rip the Dixie Chicks on the awards show tonight, F U R M is all that needs to be said.  She's a no-talent, fugly, brain-dead hillbilly who should be working in a convenience store somewhere instead of being given a platform to take shots at real musicians who aren't even in the room.  Go back to the Ozarks RM.  We won't miss you at all+music
Good greatest hits package+P+This is some of Reba's best material, and there isn't a bad song on this CD.  Some of the best songs on here are, "You Lie", Rumor Has It", "Is There Life Out There", "Fancy", "Does He Love You", and "Walk On".  All of these songs except for "Fancy" were #1 hits.  The only downside to this album is that it is missing LOTS of songs that were either No. 1s or top tens.  All in all this is a good album and I would recommend it to Reba fans+music
'Double-time' to Cadence+N+This recording is NOT meant as workout aid.  The cadence is 'double-time' (equivalent to a 'jog') not 'running.'  The numerous jody snippets (and that is what they are) on this and I would assume similar recordings are meant to fill a special niche in music; that being the archiving of the military's equivalent to sea chanties, road gang and field songs.  They make hard, boring, repetitive work go easier.  God knows pounding down a road for ten miles with a full ruck is a challenge physically and mentally.  These recordings would be much more useful workout-wise if, rather than snippets, they were longer.  There are a couple of DIs though on this recording that have REAL talent; good 'lyrics', good voices and a hell of a lot of character.  As an aside; my the military has certainly become PC since the 60's!  These jody's aren't anything like the ones I recall from boot camp - with only one exception that pops to mind.  (My '2 Star' grade is for missing the mark as a workout aid.  I'd give it '3 Stars' for what I call it's archival 'potential' which could be improved substantially.+music
Not that great+N+The only song I like on the album is "For These Times"...the rest of the songs are crummy. Her song "Anyway" just gets on my nerves. The album sounds like pop/rock/opera/ONE BIG MESS!!!! Martina can't sing a damn note and this album sounds terrible! What the hell went wrong here? Don't waste your money! Buy Kellie Pickler and Carrie Underwood and Dolly Parton+music
My Intro To The Elements Of The Universe!+P+Though I know they made 3 albums before this one  with an early line up of some of the best jazz players  of the time and future jazz players even  (Hubert & Ronnie Laws)... 1973's "Head To The Sky" was my first introduction to the elements of the universe aka Earth, Wind & Fire! They are my all-time favorite band and this is the  album that started that love affair between them and myself!  In 1973, I was a 9 yr old kid who was developing my  own burgeoning musical gifts,  and boy, was there so many great musical  mentors from that time to follow... Stevie was in the middle of his incredible creative  run with "Innervisions" taking the world by storm! Donny Hathaway was at his brilliant peak with the now iconic "Extensions Of A Man"..  ( I miss Donny!)  WAR was groovin' with "Deliver The Word",  Sly Stone was bumpin' the airwaves with his  last good effort "Fresh",  a pre-mothership Funkadelic was ripping it up  and slightly freaking my little 9 yr old brain out  with their 1973 effort "Cosmic Slop", The Isley Brothers had revamped and were begining their incredible 70's multi-platinum streak with "3+3"....  Man, it was truly a time of artistic giants  and the bar was set high then! (Unlike today!)  Of course I was exposed to all this and more by  my mother and older cousins who were doing their thing  at that time with the weed, wine and parties! But even then, my musical aesthetic was way keen  and I was absorbing everything I heard at warp speed! One day my momz brought home an album with this group of smiling faces on it,  adorned in the flower / peace regalia of the time  and it read "HEAD TO THE SKY".. I listened intently as she put it on and the tribal thunderstorm that is the intro to "Evil" swept me up!  That was the first time I'd ever heard the instrument  that was to become an E,W&F staple in years to come.. the kalimba, and man could Maurice wail on that thing! I loved the atmosphericness of this album! All music was like that then, it created it's  own atmosphere and took you to a heightened place.   After the tribal funk of "Evil", my young ears  were treated to what sounded like angels ascending  from heaven as the sitar/fender rhodes intro of  "Keep Your Head To The Sky" began with Verdine purculating underneath on bass and  Al Mackay and Johnny Graham doing their thing subtlely.  Then a 21 yr old Phillip Bailey, one of the greatest  falsetto voices ever, at the height of his gifts,  began to sing and I was transfixed! When that angelic sounding chorus kicked in,  I felt like I had left my body!  And just when I thought I couldn't go any higher.. Philip and Jessica Cleaves, who would leave the group soon after this album was released,  chimed together like songbirds from nirvana!  That did it!...I was disciple from then on! "Build Your Nest" was as funky as an  old batch of cabbage! It had a good message and a young Larry Dunn  was wearing that clavinet out big time!  Then a piercing sonic interlude led to  the gospel-inflected and deeply introspective  song "The World's A Masquerade", one of my  faves to this day! Maurice was holding church!..laying down his  story of how humanity is hypocritical & phony at times,  and Phillip and the choir was testifying in the background! It was pure rapture to my ears then and still  gives me chills now, some 33 yrs later!   Side Two opened with the breezy jazzy-funk  of "Clover", which was great too, followed by the  latin-jazz fusion of "Zanzibar" which is like an  iliad through afro-carribean music utopia!   To say that this album and group left an  indelible impression on my pysche is an understatement! Of course, after this one was a string of majestic  and innovative material which grooved the world  and made them the icons that they are!  But this album was my introduction to them,  and like any first love, it lingers in your memory forever! --Enjoy--+music
The best Danish woman artist+P+Please let me recommend this album from the bottom of my heart. I have heard it about a million times, but everytime I discover something new. Tina's voice is simply beautiful.  A little bit of trivia; Tina Dico's real name is actually Tina Dickow, but her name was changed to make it more appealing to the english language. Now you have something to tell your friends while listening to this superb album+music
"Safe" Debut+P+Without a doubt the captain's most commercial and publicly attainable album.  This makes it the perfect place to start or to back off to when you need a break from avant gaurd.  The most prominent feature on the production is, of course, the Muddy Water, Pigpen growl of a voice that is the genius Beefheart.  His delta blues mannerisms are evident throughout the album , especially in the bluesy and semi uptempo "Sure Enough and Yes I Do"; Ry Cooder covering the slide part extremely well.  This is certanly blues, but not as we have all come to know and love it.  The ryhthm section of the Magic Band truly shine on this recording.  The bass and percussion breakdowns of "Zig Zag Wanderer" and "Abba Zabba" are absolutely phenomenal.  Proof that you don't need to show off and squese as many notes as possible into each second to sound great.  Cooder does an excellent job and certanly shows his influence as well.  The rest of the magic band pull together to make a good, straight ahead(at least for them) album.  "Call on Me" is an interesting little pop number in the style of Otis Redding.  It's one of the low points on the  album, but that's not saying much.  This fades directly into the in-your-face blues-rock romp of "Dropout Boogie".  The lines-you wanna do what-I told you what and n' what about after that-always get stuck in my head for a while.  The little instrumental dittle, ding da ding da ding, you know, that part, is pretty damn cool aswell. "I'm Glad" always reminds me of a Zappa and the Mother's song (in a good way)  The thumping-hardhitting "Electricity" is a favorite of mine.  The high pitched voice covering the lines- High voltage man kisses night to bring the light to those who need to hide their shadow deed etc.-are extremely well done.  This song starts out a couple of my favorite songs on the album, including the phycadelic "Yellow Brick Road" and the amazing "Abba Zabba".  "Plastic Factory" does remind me of Pigpen and the Dead playing electric blues like Big Boss Man or Smokestack Lightning.  I was surprised to see that others had heard this connection, but it only makes sense.  This is considered a compliment to the captain because the Dead with Pigpen were absolutely unstoppable. Beefheart is a better harmonica player and has a better style and deliverance, but Pigpen combined with the Dead certainly stand up quite well to this album on alot of occurances. "Grown so Ugly" has kind of the same effect, but it leans much more toward the Led Zeppelin side of things.  "Autumn's Child" and "Where There's Woman" are great phycadelic blues ballads that wrap up the album.  That ends the original brilliant album entiteled Safe As Milk, but I think the bonus songs truly add something to the album, especially "Safe as Milk".  Alot of these songs, or alternate versions of these songs are featured on The Mirror Man Sessions, I May Be Hungry But I Sure Ain't Weird, and Strictly Personal(I recommend these as well).  They were all originally going to be on a double album called "Plain Brown Wrapper" and would be better in this form.  These song's are the Captian's beginings into wierd phycadelia and add alot to the straight ahead feel of the original album.  They show a true progression towards Trout Mask and Lick My Decals Off, the pinnicle of beefheart and the Magic Band's work.  Overall this is the perfect album for a begginer or long time fan who needs a break from the sometimes esoteric music of later albums+music
Smooth Jazz Sucks+N+I hate to take the time to write this on here...but, as far as I am concerned Smooth Jazz is a sad excuse for music.  I am an avid jazz fan and musician.  Smooth jazz is a joke+music
Very live Dead+P+The old bromide said it all...on a good night, there really was "nothing like a Grateful Dead concert," and that held true for both their acoustic and electric sets. RECKONING captures some of the best moments of their 1980 Radio City Music Hall and San Francisco acoustic sets, and they've put several winners on here. "China Doll," "To Lay Me Down," "Bird Song," "Cassidy" and "Ripple" are particularly outstanding, but except for a somewhat dirge-like "It Must Have Been The Roses" (c'mon, Jerry, pick up the tempo!), everything here shows these ol' reliables at their unplugged best.   What else is there to say? The Grateful Dead may be gone, but the music is as present---and as timeless---as ever. Some of the best of it can be found here+music
Where's the beat?+N+I bought this CD and was dissapointed that the song I heard on the radio which had an uptempo steppers beat was not on the album. Instead I got a cd full of elevator music that quite frankly is sub-par at best. If you like  that sort of thing then this is for you+music
Derailers - Soldiers of Love+P+This is my first Derailers album.  I had heard of them before, but never really wanted to buy an album.  I think I've been missing out on a great band!  Derailers' "Soldier of Love" is good - really good - I'm tempted to give it 5 stars but that'll be determined if I'm still listening to this 5 years from now.  For now though, this is great "Americana" music.  This is what real music is about.  This is where country music started, where it has evolved to, and it's nice to see how it can still sound good in the year 2006.    The songs are really good throughout - start to finish.  The lyrics and choruses are very catchy without being cheesey - except for the "Get 'Er Done" song - That phrase is so played out by now, you'd think they'd have known better.    This album takes honky tonk, country, rockabilly, and mixes them all together to make a great album.  It's a record for good times and cold beer.  It's nice to hear real good, quality "country" music every once in awhile+music
A Pathetic Stab at Mediocrity+N+Instead of buying the whole album, do yourself and your wallet a favor by only downloading only one song considering they all sound exactly the same.  On the other hand, if you like talentless droning, lack of depth and variety which can only be compared to watching the landscapes change while driving through Nebraska, then feel free to waste your money on this mockery of an album+music
5 stars is not enought...+P+I own every Danzig-era Misfits release and to me this is hands down the best one of them all.  A solid album with 17 awesome tracks plus a bonus track of studio screw ups.  Every song on here is a great listen plus the sound quality isnt that bad compared to his other recordings.  There are alot of reviews claiming Walk Among Us is there defining masterpiece but I disagree; its great but not as great as Static Age+music
I highly recommend this CD+P+Yolanda Adams' Christmas CD is simply beautiful. I love the arrangments of all the songs on this disc.  I can listen to the whole CD over and over again.  Her rendition of The Christmas Song is my favorite.  You will not be disappointed with this album+music
Ridin Low+N+Living Legends was good but did you think that Puffy was going to let this legendary duo out of Memphis make another album without a harmful pop vibe attached to it? You dont know Pus Daddy very well. Relax And Take Notes, Cruisin, Runnin Out Of Bud, Get Low and Stand Up are the only tracks that are worth checking out. This is the rest of the album. Filler: Ridin High(fruity commercial joint, sounds forced, I hate puffy so much right now), 30 Rocks(the hook doesnt make any sense plus who told Diddy Kong it was cool to bust a verse?), Hickory Dickory Dock(worst hook since.......Yung Joc's I Know You See It!), Clap On(speak of the devil, Dumb Joc makes a lame appearance on this dead track), Memphis(sampling a hillbilly tune? Who let them do it? The worst ode to a city ever), Alcohol P**** and Weed(worst hook next to Hickory Dickory Dock) etc. Bottom Line: This is the worst album Ball & G ever made. Their rhymes and hooks for most of the songs were weak and their guest appearances were pretty tame. Signing with Puffy at the time might have been a good look for them now its a negative look for them. Puff Dookie cant stand to have rappers on his label that are not as commercial and pop as he is. If the first Boyz N Da Hood was alright you can almost imagine how bad the next one is going to sound. Support every album Eightball and MJG made on SuaveHouse Records(including In Our Lifetime, their best album) and stay away from this train wreck of an album.+music
Blame Puffy+N+It is sad that these two southern hip-hop legends good names have been blemished by Bad Boy records.  The transformation from their classic hit "on the outside looking in" along with a host of other great albums to this disgrace is quite sad.  I'm sure your boy puffy offered alot more money and fame than they have ever had in the underground, and it hurt 'em.  Some will say "well thats what you get for being a sell out" but if your in the game making underground hits for almost 2 decades and your only know to a small region, you may not feel the accomplishment or respect you deserve.  I forgive them, not Puffy.  Buy some of their old stuff+music
PERFECT!+P+This is the BEST Heart-felt Christmas Story I have seen in years. I have 2 copies of this and still had to watch it everytime it was on TV. AWESOME!!!!+music
I have a confession to make to you Josh Homme... I love you!+P+This CD is very awesome!!! I can't through the whole CD because... I'm in love with Josh Homme... he's the lead singer from this band. His voice... is so... awesome! When I listen to his songs... I know that he's talking to me! I'm so deeply in love with him. I'll do anything for him I'll even die for him! If anything happens to him... I don't know what I'll do with myself! I hope the spell will never break.  Josh... I love you... I want you to hear me sing and you can sing to me. I love you Josh... I love you. I'll kill myself for you+music
One of the worst singers I've ever heard+N+Oh my - where did this young lady learn to sing? It's not music from an "old soul", as another reviewer put it - just bad singing. Ugg. Stay away from this one+music
2 1/2 stars-- Post punk energy music.+N+Punk, like all great rock music, was a rebellion, in this case against the excesses of the late '60s and early '70s.  BUt somewhere along the way, it was unavoidable that bands would come along that loved the energy and honesty of punk and the very material they were rebelling against-- in the case of XTC, the lush pop and psychedelia of the late '60s.  But these influences were far receeded on their debut album, "White Music" is firmly lodged in the sounds of punk and new wave and is, more than anything else, an album of energy music.  The net result of this is that hte album is inevitably at odds with the strenghts of the band-- songwriters Andy Partridge and Colin Moulding would come later to excel at lush, detailed arrangement full of unerring pop hooks, textures and harmonies, but here, it's all very stripped back, ska and punk influenced pop.  Moulding's trademark slithering bass isn't quite in place yet, though he's already starting to find holes to fit himself in, he primarily forms a solid lockstep with drummer Terry Chambers.  Partridge's guitar, for his part, limits largely to angular punk and ska trends-- loud and aggressive, pushing the music along from the front, which leads Barry Andrews' buzzing organ sound to be largely the soloing voice in the band.  But with all this, the real weakness was singing voices too used to poor microphones of cheap clubs-- Partridge and Moulding both use an unnatural, clipped vocal style that seems more concerned with trying to annunciate than anything else, to the detrimant of the band's sound.  With all of this creating an unnatural tension on the album, it still manages to hit pretty frequently, helped no doubt by the fact that Partridge's songwriting was already top notch.  Standout "Statue of Liberty" best illustrates this-- hints of ska, gentle organ textures, and a funky bassline over which Partridge's clever story of unrequited love can be read out.  Nearly as notable are punky opener "Radios in Motion" (full of crackling punk energy), the loose-yet-detailed arrangement of early single "This is Pop?" (featuring the closest Partridge would ever come to snarling punk rebellion, even if it is laden with great pop hooks), and new wave gem "Atom Age", with just enough of a hint of Brian Wilson to pull it above the rest.  On the other hand, there's a lot of largely forgettable material-- Moulding's songwriting feels like it's not quite ready ("Set Myself on Fire") and his vocal is even more painfully forced than Partridge's ("Cross Wires"), and even Partridge has a couple duds ("Spinning Top").  Add to this an ill-conceived ska take on "All Along the Watchtower" that makes Partridge sound like a bad Hendrix imitator and you end up with a pretty mixed package.  The reissue adds quite a bit to the original-- remastered sound that has the net effect of making the record sound a bit more dated than it probably would at least provides clarity to the music and there's seven bonus tracks-- early singles and the "3D EP".  Most of this stuff is largely forgettable (Moulding's "Heatwave", Partridge's "Dance Band" and "Traffic Light Rock"), but early single "Science Friction" and its b-side "She's So Square" are pulsing full of nervous tension and energy and make a decent listen.  XTC would find enormous heights in the following decade, and I can't help but color my reviews of their early material based on the heights they'd eventually reach.  I have a sneaking suspicion that had I not heard what they'd be capable of in the future, I'd be inclined to give this a much higher rating, but compared to their later work, "White Music" sounds positively amateurish.  It's got its moments, but they'd go on to do a lot better+music
I agree... make up your own mind!!+P+I think that Carmen Rasmusen has a beautiful voice, go to her website, and listen for yourself before you go letting people that are obviously trying to sabotage her (and the American Idol show as well) make up your mind for you.  I don't know where those people get that Carmen sounds like a goat.  That's just crazy talk!  I bet those people hurling insults couldn't sing to save their own lives.  Oh... and just for the record... I'm not a family member+music
Dreamer, you stupid little dreamer (Not AT ALL worth Import price)+N+This is the song that I keep singing to myself EVERY TIME I buy another Falkner record (exceptions being the Holiday single, & the Sub Pop set), or any other offering of ANY kind from ANY member involved with the best band of the 90's (Jellyfish). And I didn't discover them POST break-up, oh no....I was in the fanclub and wore the advance copy of Bellybutton (Vinyl, yo!!) out on my college radio shift! I was also in the Redd Kross fanclub and consider them HIGHER than the Jellies...yeah, I said it. So, you can bet that I had a raging "you-know-what" in my pants for THIS record!?!?   Import price and a long wait from Japan later, and I am once again...let down. It has been painfully obvious for a while where the magic dust came from within Jellyfish, and this is another testament to Andy Sturmer's greatness. I know, they weren't trying to make a Jellyfish album, but the songwriting here doesn't hold the slightest flicker to say, even a Beatnick Beatch tune. If The New Cars had hired Faulkner (who rhymes as bad as Ace Frehley in spots), instead of Rundgren, and they went with the songwriting of 'Door to Door', this would be VERY close. This goes beyond "having a retro sound" and straight into Justin Timberlake trying to have a retro sound.  Better yet, if you actually enjoyed ANY of Duran Duran's last two records, then this will knock your socks off....in fact, send ME $30 and you can have this copy.   Production quality and my sincere love for the past with these three guys, keeps me from comitting this review to ONE star+music
Should be "Madeleine Holliday"+P+If you like the sound of Billie Holidays, voice you will be floored by the similarity in Madeleine Peyroux. I hate to say it but her voice sounds almost identical but has more range. The music style isn't totally that old classic jazz sound but similar; some songs seem tinted with a New Orleans sound and some a tiny bit folk-like. Over all smooth, delightful songs. Not one of them is annoying which is lucky when buying an unknown cd+music
misfits meets the nutley brass+N+WHY +music
Same old songs.+N+Nothing rare here. Just the same old hits recycled into a new package. I would have thought VH-1 would have dug up some unreleased tracks or remixes, but nope.   You are better off buying "The Best of Rick Springfield" -- it has all these songs and is also remastered+music
'Fly' not good enough to carry this one+N+I thought this album might be decent based on 'Fly,' but it is amazingly garbage.  The only song besides 'Fly' that I thought was good was Speedhome California, maybe because it talks about California and I live here.  But sadly this album is not worth the $2.99 I paid for i+music
why listen to this garbage?+N+honestly, all her songs are sexual in some way. the way she poses, moves, dresses is wrong and sends the wrong message across. she is unmodest, makes herself into some sex toy on stage and videos, cant sing to save her life. Rebecca St. James is definetly a good alternative that has enough self-confidence in her looks and voice that she doesnt have to wear a [...] outfit on all her albums or cover-up her voice with a computer. get her Transform album. Great pop/rock/teckno-style music with a good message, better voice, and in my oponion, better looking artist.+music
Enh, it's OK+N+Watered down folk-psych circa 1968. If you think Country Joe and The Fish is too hard rock then this is for you. Too too flower power and not very imaginative, in fact it's rather boring. Perhaps it should be retitled Exile On Yawn Street+music
What a disapointment!+N+Clearly the worse she has ever came out with!  Only one good song on entire CD...+music
Virtuoso Guitar Playing, Complex Musical Structures!+N+Here we go again....another tortured collection of three chord, twelve barre Delta Blues. In truth, these songs were redundant and whiny when the very limited Robert Johnson first recorded them; now hearing Clapton ressurect them is just plain annoying. How many times can we hear "I woke up this morning, baby; My cow just up and died.....da dum, da dum, da dum.....I woke up this morning, baby. My cow just up and died. Da dum, da dum, da dum.... So I drank a bottle of hooch and I began to cry....da dum, da dum, da dum...." Come on, people! If this is genius songwriting and guitar playing then we should all simply throw in the towel on civilization. When Eric Clapton plays Cole Porter, Duke Ellington, and Rogers and Hart on his guitar---unaccompanied----chords, melody and bass line----like Django Reinhardt, Wes Montgomery, and Joe Pass----then maybe I'll consider him a great guitarist. Today's youth are clueless about almost everything, and guitar virtuosity is no exception. I don't believe Clapton has ever heard of key modulation, arpeggios, or chord substitutions. In truth, he is an average rock guitarist, and considering the primative structure of rock and roll guitar playing, that's not saying much. For anyone to call him a great guitarist, let alone the greatest guitarist whoever lived, is indicative of either juvenile delinquency or just plain stupidity. It's like saying Madonna is the greatest singer of all time. Odds are those who make such vacuous, ludicrous statements are the children or grandchildren of the druggie Woodstock generation who wouldn't know a great guitarist if he/she tripped over him (which would be likely since they were all drugged out of their minds most of the time). I know we're living in the age of grand mediocrity, but enough is enough. Go buy a Wes Montgomery, Django Reinhardt or Barney Kessel album and listen to sophisticated, nuanced, and soulful guitar viruosity. If you have half a brain, you'll throw away your collection of rock guitar icons and beg foregiveness for being such an uneducated, unsophisticated nitwit who once claimed that one-dimensional druggies like Clapton and Hendrix were great guitarists. If after listening to these truly talented guitarists who actually play more than three chords you still hold to your position that Clapton is a great guitarist, here's what you do: pick up your Fender Strat, turn the amp volume up to 10, smoke a joint, and go stick your head between your distortion chambers and fuzz boxes and make a lot of noise and pretend you too are a great guitarist. Eric Clapton is a great guitarist! What a dumb society we have wrought since the late 1960s.+music
Atmospheric... oniric.. contemporary ambient +P+I am in my early forties, and this album I hear in a cd store some years ago while browsing.. i just could not help appreciating the surreal sound of this music, I just had to get it..  get some good wines, get together with your friends, this is perfect ambient music .. in the road while its raining and you really need your to be in a different world.. this is the musi+music
like this CD+P+this is a good CD. but it is missing something(s)  treat me right and crimson and clover.  Pat did a good job on both of these songs.+music
Yes indeed, EBM is Dead+P+It has been a long while since I last submitted a review on amazon because I have been calmly waiting for that divine inspiration to catch me off guard when I least expect it. You see, I had been in a bit of a funk lately, as I'd found myself in what was shaping up to be a sizable drought in regards to finding some new music that really moved me, both inside and out. Enter: Neuroticfish. As menacingly delicious as Mr. Sascha himself, this fish has one potent bite. Honestly, who knows what genre this type of music truly fits into; synthpop, future pop, new wave, darkwave, ebm, industrial---it's all electronic and good from my perspective. However I must also admit that like one of the previous reviewers, I am quite picky about what I will listen to and enjoy. It takes a lot more than a few 'hot beats' blasting out of a subwoofer to make me happy. The comparisons to Apop, VNV, etc are all relevant, but while I am familiar with and respect those so-called "Top contenders of the EBM scene," I feel that Neuroticfish music posesses a depth and vibrancy to it that is fresh, exhilarating and immensely satisfying, which is more than what I can say for any other "EBM" band.  The music pumps and throbs with all the seasonings of top notch dark, dance club beats and is also MELODIC, which seems to be a commodity that often places it into the classification of synthpop, which of course automatically gets the label of being too wimpy, poppy, sappy to be labeled as EBM(And I thought goths were picky.) But alas, it's not until we hear Sascha's deep, butterflies-in-stomach-inducing voice that the magic truly begins. He sings with a variety of colorful emotions that range from heart wrenching and tinged with animmosity to tastefully demented("They're coming to take me away" is a song that my mother described as being freaky, disturbing music of a carnival gone quite wrong, ha ha) and melodic(Yes, that deep baritone DOES sometimes resemble David Gahan, which is the highest compliment that one can possibly get from me.) This music has the intense, catchy, and emotional clout of first rate synthpop combined with the deliriously ecstatic dance riffs of EBM. Standout tracks are the intense "I don't need the city," "Waving hands,"The bomb," "They're coming to take me away," and "I never chose you." Pretender and not a contender? I doubt Sascha is trying to distinguish himself as a product of any 'scene' anyway. Afterall, EBM is dead   =)+music
Uccchhh, they called these three &quot;the talented ones&quot;!+N+I ask that because the male lead singer of one of the '80's best contributers to the synth-pop genre, Human League, said that on the audio liner notes portion of their &quot;Very Best Of&quot; album. The three  former members of this group left in the early '80's and formed their own  music group, being Heaven 17. I'm sorry to say that, having listened to  this album one night this past week, I find the CD's entire song selection,  in my opinion, to leave a whole lot to be desired. I don't even remember  any of the titles, and I can't understand how any of these purely mediocre  tunes ever could have been a hit in any country. That is essentially it for  me, the reason I didn't give this album only one star is that, thankfully,  it's not the absolute worst I've ever heard. I don't think that my taste in  music could possibly be that bad, I've got taste, decency, dignity,  integrity, and a reputation to uphold after all+music
Lost Pastoral Serendity...+P+Forest is a low-key folk group that is in line with Incredible string band, but in my opinion, they are even better. This 2 CD package is a very wise buy as it's full of wonderful and amazing music. 3 guys are all  talented multi-instrumentalists and their compositions sounds like the  Renaisance folk songs! Very beautiful, fantasy, dreams, love themes  incorporated seamlessly in this package. Best Cuts: Graveyard (CD 2), Bad  Penny (Opening Track of CD 1)...etc. In general CD 1 is even better, of  course, both CD is fresh and never boring+music
Happy surprise+P+I had read some negative things about this album.  I am a diehard Stones fan and wanted to include it in my collection and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this album.  It is pretty fantastic!  I would recommend it highl+music
Why on earth is this listed under classical music?+N+Pavarotti has a short but excellent repertoire that belongs in &quot;Classical Music&quot; (e.g. Fille du Regiment), however 99% of his recordings belong in Popular Music.  Amazon folks, please get your act straight on this guy and his other two tenor friends+music
Brent Mydland's finest hour+P+I think "In the Dark" is the best studio disc the band did with keyboardist Brent Mydland. He sounded tentative in his singing on "Go To Heaven," and I don't think his songs on that album stand up to his contributions here, especially "Tons of Steel." In fact, the three major writers -- Mydland, Bob Weir and Jerry Garcia, with their respective lyricist partners -- all acquit themselves well on this disc. Garcia's "Touch of Grey" and "Black Muddy River" are his strongest tunes in years; you have to go back to the better parts of the "Terrapin" suite to find anything as significant from him. Weir's "Hell in a Bucket" and the outtake "My Brother Esau" have a gritty, churning resonance. As some have pointed out, this was NOT the Dead's final studio album; "Built to Last" followed. Mydland had more songs on that one, but I think he was overrepresented; then again, maybe that was necessary, as Garcia's stuff on that disc was pretty weak. In short, as far as the studio is concerned, I think this was the Dead's last great statement; I would have been quite content if "Built to Last" had never seen daylight. "Black Muddy River," then, isn't the last song Garcia ever would sing in the studio -- but maybe it should have been. What a hauntingly proper final tune it would have been for him+music
AAAAAAHHHH!+P+Thanks Vicki, for being obedient. You recorded some songs that I had heard of (He's been faithful, IN the Presence). I wasn't prepared for your record to be solidly a blessing. Don't take that as an insult, but I was tempted to only listen to those songs, but I said "Christian, you need to just listen to the CD." From the start, it tells me the direction of the record, and it's an awesome dedication to the lord" It gives me tools to worship with, thanks for staying in the industry and minsitering. Also, your child is cute+music
The best SAMIAM record ever!+P+This is as good as it gets folks.  This is one fantastic record.  I could not list the best songs because they are all good.  The vocals are absolutely awesome.  I love the sound quality, production, and dynamics of this record.  I highly suggest that you pick this one up+music
Magnum Opus+P+If there's one CD that I'd call Jill Sobule's magnum opus, I'd say that it'd be Happy Town.  There's so much good material here+music
Party vibe - instant fun+P+Beck's best at his hippest, funkiest, top. Put this CD in your player and a party is virtually bound to start. Unlike almost any other pop artist Beck oozes talent and imagination. He shrugs off convention and creates an amalgam of musical styles that always seem to fit just right. Each of Beck's new CD's always seem new and some fans of his earlier works might not like this new one but if you like any kind of dance or funk there's a whole lot of fun here. Mixed Bizness gets my vote for the best.+music
Toothsome+P+Pop the box and you see an Egon Schiele drawing, an attenuated early modernist nude wearing her anxieties on her skin. It's a fitting visual reference, for the Willowz are a nervous band, also a raw, ambitious, self-challenging, brilliant and perplexing one. They have great hooks, a gift for casually tossing off little bits of humor and beauty, and this timeless unselfconscious quality that's easier heard than described. In the bland stew of indie rock, the Willowz are a toothsome morsel. (review from Scram Magazine #21+music
Import in Disguise+N+Wouldn't recommend this at all, most of the songs are not the original recordings but Johnny must have redone them on a tired day in the studio.  Others are from live concerts.  Save your $$+music
warmed-over weather report+N+What really struck me on first listening to this, was the superficial resemblance to old Weather Report recordings (this was before I actually got to the WR cover of "Boogie Woogie Waltz"; I subsequently listened to the original on Sweetnighter, which turned out to be far superior in every way). Part of the problem with this recording seems to be the ... musical ideas expressed on here; subtract Wayne Shorter, Joe Zawinul, and various WR drummers; replace them, and this is what you come up with. I almost had to turn it off when I heard those "cheezy" electric keyboard settings on a couple of tracks. A second listen (I always listen at least twice before getting rid of a recording), confirmed my initial assessment. Mr. Mcbride is a monster bass player, but this was almost embarrassing; he would have been much better off actually hooking up with Shorter, Zawinul, and company in a Weather Report revisited project. That would be really good+music
All hype aside...+P+This albums rocks. Nothing is more brutal than Black Flag when fronted by Rollins. In my opinion, this was Black Flag at their punk best. Not much can be said about this album that hasn't already been said. I highly reccomend anyone even slightly interested in getting into hardcore get this album, it's a rush from start to finish+music
Sorry ... Not One of DL&Q's best+N+I really enjoy Doyle Lawson and Quicksilver, especially their gospel music.  This is their first release for Rounder Records.  I suspect the content and flow of this album represents a strong influence by the record company and not the usual freedom which Doyle Lawson has had in the past to pick the song lineup.  Perhaps they were just trying to "break the mold" so to speak and stay away from heavy gospel content.  I'm not sure where that came from, but to me it causes this release to come across as forced and mechanical rather than natural and flowing.    Don't get me wrong, the musicianship and especially the vocals are top notch, but for me this does not make up for the material selected for this release.  Go back and listen to some of the soulful and sincere music from their previous releases and then compare it to this album.   I will be going back to listen to Rock My Soul and the older DL&Q material and You Gotta Dig a Little Deeper will probably be a very infrequent visitor in my CD player.  If this is how DL&Q is going to be with Rounder, then in my opinion we would all  have been better off without that relationship.  - Scripto+music
Yiddish Radio Project+P+Charming, delightful, and surprising, it evokes and energizes dim memories and resurrects the full emotional impact of memories still fresh. And LEVINE MIT DEIN FLYING MACHINE was startling in its evocation of a time when Jews were desperate for acceptance, and went to great efforts to memorialize the accomlpishments of Jewish Americans in song and otherwise, no longer content to remain outside looking in. I bought several CD's and gave them as gifts, which were big hits with all.+music
A disappointing album from a great band+N+To preface: I am a longtime fan of INXS and own everything from Listen Like Thieves to Elegantly Wasted. Elegantly Wasted is, in my opinion, almost worse than Full Moon, Dirty Hearts. Actually, I will definitively say it IS worse. There are the gems Show Me (Cherry Baby) and Elegantly Wasted, the title track, but the album quickly runs out of gas, runs together, and seems uniformly tepid, like lukewarm water. It doesn't rock the way INXS usually rocks. It attempts to experiment like some of the earlier projects successfully did, only unsuccessfully. There aren't the hooks or the tunes to redeem it. This is disappointing because I am a fan and I want to give the band an open ear and not condemn their work. But this album, unfortunately, stinks.  If you've ever seen INXS' Live Baby Live concert or listened to any album from 1985's Listen Like Thieves to 1992's Welcome to Wherever You Are, you probably concur that INXS was (and is, thanks to their newfound popularity with the Rockstar INXS TV show) a band capable of a great sound and a load of great songs. For instance, the entire playlist around 1991 was one great song after another. It was the pinnacle of the band's career. Michael's stage performance oozed with charisma and sexiness, Andrew's (and Michael's) songwriting was top notch, the band's arrangements were tight and good. And then something happened.  Fan reaction to X was much more tepid than to Kick, although X still sold fairly well. The band embarked on a successful tour. Around this time, grunge became huge in the global musical consciousness, and by the time of Welcome to Wherever You Are in 1992, the INXS sound was out-of-style. But ironically, that album contains some of the band's most diverse, greatest work.   INXS is releasing a new album soon with their new lead singer, J.D. I hope, and am confident, that it will be a return to greatness for the band. I believe that they can still crank out bitchin' tunes once again+music
That one and only+P+Louis Armstrong has one of those voices that no matter what you are doing, when you hear him sing, you know its him.  The distinctiveness and depth of his voice is undeniable.  It is a good thing this is a CD and not an album, because it would be worn out by now if it were an album+music
The Best...+P+The Ozark Mountain Daredevils will probably always be my very favorite American band. I believe they would have been my fave regardless, but they have a special sentimental cache for me--I came from the same town they are from (Springfield, MO) and in the 1970's, we got to hear them often. The secret of the Daredevil's music was that it made you feel really good. I can't think of a single unit of musicians who so consistently produced music that can make you feel better. The music on this album, and many of the records that followed just seem to clear your head of all bad thoughts.  The Daredevils are first-rate singers, musicians, and songwriters. They're just the best. Always have been, always will be...this is what American music was supposed to be about. Thanks, guys..+music
The boys of Wham! will help you reach that goal!+P+Stuck in traffic? Got in a fight with a loved one? Somebody spilled beer on your favorite hotpink t-shirt?  This album will take all of that pain away and more.   Such issues as unemployment and teen pregnancy were never fun to dance to...until now! Say what you will about George Michael, but in my opinion, he is one talented man. Buy this.+music
Misleading advertising+N+To be sure, this album has some beautiful cuts. But that is overshadowed for me by the fact that while megastars Bartoli and Bocelli are featured so prominently on the cover, THEY ONLY SING ON 4 OUT OF 16 TRACKS. This kind  of misleading advertising is reprehensible. If I hadn't purchased this  while on vacation, I would have returned i+music
Fond Childhood Memories+P+I looked for years for this CD in music stores everywhere.  I was so excited to find it at Amazon.com.  If you love those fond childhood memories this is the Christmas CD for you.  My whole family loves it!  Now I'm creating memories with my kids!  They love to "sing-a-long+music
I'm Still Laughing+N+This CD is great- as a gag gift. This is a redundant piece of s**t, and I am still laughing at the amazingly cliche' lyrics. Escape The Fate is like a bad From First To Last cover band...the lead singer sounds almost exactly like Sonny Moore. This is proof that the wold is going to Hell.  For good emo/screamo, pick up From First To Last's "Heroine" and Atreyu's "The Curse"+music
Please enter a title for your review+N+It's ridiculous that any band would even bother recording and releasing such weak bland redundant excuses for songs, but what's especially disconcerting, yet somehow not that surprising, is that it's coming from a band that earlier this year released an ep of perfectly decent alt-rock emo tunes. It's not really even that i'm mourning a lack of talent in the faux-edgy music scene, but just the complete lack of awareness or regard for the difference between a song that has an actual hook, something distinctive in it that makes you want to hear it again, and just rehashing formulas, boring basic rigid commercial conventions without even 1% of variation to make it marginally interesting. These guys wrote 5 decent semi-interesting tunes on the ep, now on the album they just don't care anymore, they're just rewriting other bands songs, following formulas like it's their job, like they never knew the difference between hooks and plodding non-melodies, as if it was just blind luck that they wrote actual songs on the ep.+music
No, not so great+N+To compare this to a Digweed, Sasha, or Nick Warren mix would be very misleading.  With a few exceptions (Sugarglider, Mara), this is a very generic, flavorless trance mix.  It is *not* complex.  There is no groove, no soul, no build - in short, very little to keep your interest going.  It's not the trance that you'll find on Digweed-Hong Kong or Anthony Pappa - Nu Breed.  If you're expecting something of that quality, don't buy this.     I was very disappointed in this mix, although it did give me new appreciation for the kind of mixes created by quality DJs (not Fortier)+music
Review+N+I USE to own this CD,but, I hated it and therefor... did not listen to it much at all.  I ended up donating it to the local Library+music
Takes My Breath Away+P+This Disc is merely further proof of what the world already knows. Yo Yo Ma was in fact born to play the Cello, it is simply fantastic. It is a must own for me, It feels the air around you with such wonderful tones. Although some classical snobs might complain that this is nothing more than a pseudo Classical album, who cares. They should find the nearest emergency room and have someone remove the poles from thier *sses. No apologizes are needed hear, this disc is all that it needs to be, which is absolutely magnificient.......  Peace: The*Hot*Wax*Ki+music
THE BEST BRIGHT EYES CD YET+P+from track one to thirteen i found they we where all great.  i picked up on a lot of new york influences in the writing of the lyrics. man this cd is great i got it last wednesday took a drive and haven't stopped listening to it, and now i can't wait to see him next tuesday, rather them. if you are a bright eyes fan, or have just started listening to them, or haven't heard them at all this will either a: want you to get more of his stuff or b: just listen to the cd over and over it is that good. he really brought it together with just great writing, great formations of the songs, and just overall chills when i listen to it.  i know all of his albums are personal, but this one is just great.+music
Somewhere in my wicked miserable past....+P+...I must have done something good. This CD truly is a gift. I've always been of the opinion that Sweeney Todd is Sondheim's best work. Certainly my favorite. So to have it revisited to this magnitude gives me delicious validation. The performances are flawless, and their voices pay beautiful tribute to their theatrical predecessors. I am a compulsive collector of musicals on CDs (71 at last count) However, I am no expert on the intricacies of the craft, I just know what I like. This CD clearly pushes to the front of my collection and takes its place alongside Les Miserables, Rent and The Producers. If you are even considering purchasing this, do it, thank me later+music
Still a fine place to enter from+P+I have had this cd for about two years now, having bought it when I first decided I was ready to try to get my mind around the endless array of electronica music that had interested me from afar for a long time. I find myself returning to this cd again and again and it only sounds better and better with time. It illustrates the beauty of fine trance combined with fine mixing. There is only one track I dislike. I have carried this cd while traveling and will certainly draw from it when I get around to joining the i-pod nation. This collection stands very nicely on it's own but I think it lends itself especially well to newcomers and I would highly recommend it as a window to climb through into the vast world of club music+music
More Of The Same (And That's A Good Thing)+P+The music is a bit more polished but the lyrics are just as insightful and intelligent as their previous work.  When I stumbled across Bite To Break Skin on a Warped Tour CD I fell in love and Let It Enfold You has never escaped my CD changer in my car after 3+ years. This disc is a bit slower than LIEY, not a knock on them by any stretch, just an observation.  Gone are subtle references to Greek tragedies, replaced by lifes modern trials and tribulations, still as potent as ever.  If you don't know Senses Fail and are looking for something new to experience, I feel they are a mix of old Ataris (think Giving Up On Love, Make It Last), Rufio (think Road To Recovery), and Alkaline Trio (think Mr. Chainsaw).  Along with those three bands, my musical faves also include Bad Religion, Rise Against, Tsunami Bomb, Unwritten Law and River Fenix (aka FenixTX).  As far as I'm concerned, you can't go wrong buying anything from Senses Fail, they are phenomenally talented.  If you get the chance, see them live at a small venue, they never disappoint+music
bad religion is my religion+P+this is definently one of my favorite albums of all time.  anyone who thinks punk rock cannot be intellectual, should check out bad religion, especially this album.  suffer is good from start to finish, even the songs that don't stand out as much at first, grow on you and become some of your favorites.  get this album or no control, they are both great.  the rest of their albums are actually pretty mixed in my opinion.  a few great songs and some not so great ones.  against the grain is pretty good and fans of old school punk will like how could hell be any worse.  the rest of their stuff, like i said is mixed, but none of it is bad.  but suffer and no control, just about an hour of music, are enough in my opinion to name them great.  suffer is though, probably their best.  if you want thought-provoking,fast,melodic punk, or if you like pennywise you will love this album.    +music
Love it, but...+N+DONT BUY it from AMAZON!   I got burned, I bought what was supposed to be the new delux edition and what I received was the original CD release.  I'd rather buy items like this from official stores instead of Amazon after that hell of an experience.  Over-all, its a great albu+music
Another excellent release from Moonspell+P+Moonspell's 2003 release is another one of my favorites right next to "Wolfheart". This one is almost as good as their first but comes up short in some areas. It is their second best release, in my opinion, but doesnt have as much atmosphere as "Wolfheart" did. It's good all the way through which is important, because an album that weakens near the end is never good. My favorite tracks are probably "From Lowering Skies", "Antidote", "Capricorn at Her Feet", and "Walk on the Darkside". Here are my track ratings...  1. In and Above Men - 10/10  2. From Lowering Skies - 10/10  3. Everything Invaded - 8.5/10  4. Southern Deathstyle - 8/10  5. Antidote - 10/10  6. Capricorn at Her Feet - 10/10  7. Lunar Still - 10/10  8. Walk on the Darkside - 10/10   9. Crystal Gazing - 9.5/10  10. As We Eternally Sleep on It - 8.5/10  Overall: 94% A-  It's another solid release from Moonspell. Anyone into Doom Metal would enjoy this. It's also just the way I like it, sprinkled with growling vocals and regular vocals, because I'm not a fan of songs where the screaming/growling vocals take up the entire song. Anyway it's one of their best, in my opinion, so if you have not already checked it out, you probably should.  +music
Have A Nice Day; Volume 5+P+I noticed it's been over two years since this Volume has had a new review but that is understandable considering the age of this music however it is still fun to hear this material again and during the late 60s and most of the 70s I listened to music on the radio more than I have my entire life and that is the reason these earlier Volumes of the H.A.N.D. series bring back so many pleasant memories for me. WLS, WAKY, & WKLO were my favorite 60s & 70s AM Radio stations and they played most of these songs regularly when these tunes were on the charts and it's nice to still be able to listen to them in this new Century. Does nostalgia play a role for me?.....Definitely!.....and even though this Volume 5 is evidently out of print; it is still a good one. As a matter of fact; I think it is one of the best of this series of 25 being below only Volumes 1 & 2. A few previous reviewers have spoke highly of it and a few have spoke of it as being one of the weaker ones; then again (as I've said before) it all depends on your taste for these old songs and there are several tunes on this Volume that suits my taste.       Two of them are Daddy Dewdrop's, Chick-A-Boom (Don't Ya Jes' Love It), and Jerry Reed's crossover hit, When You're Hot, You're Hot. Both are very upbeat & halarious. One of my favorite 70s bands was Hamilton, Joe Frank And Reynolds and they are also here with, Don't Pull Your Love. Murray Head's, Superstar, is a tune I hadn't heard in 30 + years and sounds great and Chase's, Get It On, (Not to be confused with T.Rex's, Bang A Gong; Get It On) is a fantastic Rocker. Although I like The Beatles Abbey Road version better; Richie Havens version of, Here Comes The Sun, also brings back fond memories. Another talented artist on this Volume is Lobo singing one of his big hits being, Me And You And A Dog Named Boo. Mike Curb Congregation's, Burning Bridges, is a good tune I probably haven't heard since it dropped off the charts back then. 60s Legends; Tommy James, and The Raiders are also here with their huge hits; the Top 10, Draggin' The Line, and the # 1 smash, Indian Reservation, (in that order) and speaking of 60s Legends.....The Fortunes are also here with the stellar, Here Comes That Rainy Day Feeling Again, and that song is the standout on this Disc.....Whew!.....Volume 5; a weaker version?.....Not To Me! This is an out of print (but strong)Volume.         Have A Nice Day; Volume 5 = 4 1/2 Stars           +music
SCARY+N+I SAW THIS MOVIE 'CAUSE I WAS INTERESTED TO SEE CATHY RIGBY, &quot;WHO WAS BORN TO PLAY PETER PAN&quot;. I HATED IT A LOT. SO, NOW I AM IN A HIGH SCHOOL PRODUCTION OF PETER PAN, AND I HAPPEND TO SEE THE MARY MARTIN VERSION, AND THE MARY MARTAIN CD. I LOVED IT! THEN I REALIZED THAT 'PETER PAN' IS NOT A BAD MUSICAL AT ALL. CATHY RIGBY AND THE &quot;CREW&quot; WERE MAKING IT BAD. I HAVE NO IDEA WHY THEY THINK CATHY RIGBY IS THE GREATEST THING SINCE SLICED BREAD. DON'T BELIEVE THEM. SHE ISN'T. SHE SOUNDED LIKE SHE WAS A STUIPED LITTLE BRAT THAT JUST WANTED TO ROT THE REST OF HIS [HER] TIME JUST SITTING IN A DARK CORNER CARVING FORKS WHILE ON THE OTHER HAND, MARY MARTAIN SOUNDS ALL CHEERFUL, FUN, AND REAL. I RECCOMEND MARY MARTAIN'S VIDEO AND CD. I SAY NO MORE+music
ABSOLUTLY AWFUL !+N+Is this for real? It sounds like John Tesh or Harry Connick Jr. I just got this CD and it put me to sleep. It should be called Destination down the tube.I'm a diehard Bon Jovi fan from New Jersey and I cannot believe he released this tragedy.I love all the CD's from Bon Jovi but this solo by Jon sounds like elevator or nursing home music.And for Richie,Bryan and Tico, please don't let Jon out of your sight again+music
One Hour of Hip Hop Scratchology..+P+Clocking in at a little less than 60 Minutes, 'Scratchology' will definately take you through the study of Scratching importance in Hip Hop history. The next time you're thinking of taking a drive or a walk, pop this CD in your player and let it ride, because it will definately take you down memory lane with flavor added by The X-Ecutioners+music
Roy's Favorite+P+This was recorded during a tour of Japan in the late 70s. Roy stated that of all the albums he released this was his favorite-many of the others he refused to acknowledge. Listening to this CD helps the listener understand why Roy thought so highly of this album- Roy was on that night and the band was tight. My only complaint is that the whole show isn't available. This is the editted show, some 46 minutes of the two hour event. Still if your a fan of this amazing guitar player you owe it to youreself to pick this CD up along with American Axe to hear this guy make that guitar cry+music
Hard Rock that Rox+P+this is an Amazing CD too bad they didn't get the attention they richly deserve I recomend this CD to fans of 3 Doors Down,Seether and Nickleback +music

This SHOULD be endangered.+N+I wouldn't have bothered if not for the fact that there was only one review for this cd giving it 5 stars...a real injustice.  This is a piece of garbage, plain and simple. If you liked their first cd you'll prolly wana smash this into little pieces and then hunt down every member of the band, no joke. The guy has a horrible voice and it's only good when he yells, which is maybe in 2 songs on this cd, both of which fall apart after the heavy point.  PURE GARBAGE, if you don't believe me buy it and see for yourself, there's a reason this cd isn't as popular as Through The Eyes and its cause IT SUCKS+music
Very relaxing except for the birds+N+The sound of the water rushing over rocks on this CD is very relaxing.  The only problem is it also has the sound of  birds chirping which is very annoying.  I did not hear these birds chirping when I first played the sound sample on Amazon.com.  So if you are thinking about buying the CD for the sound of water alone, you may want to look at a different CD+music
a classic+P+I love this album! I see in the discussions someone said you would only like this if you are "bitter and angry"...well, that's not me...and I LOVE THIS ALBUM. Shirley Manson is amazing. Not only is she gorgeous, she is a fabulous singer, and a great, intelligent writer. Although I don't agree with all the philosophies she puts into her songs(though yes, I'm anti-war and think she articulated in "Boys Wanna Fight" what's going on really well, I don't think a "free love" revolution will solve anything on personal or political levels..."Sex is not the Enemy" is a great song music-wise though...end tangent), I think she's a great example for women in many ways. We're not all waiting for a man to come along and "make it all better." We're not all demure. Shirley's lyrics express that in a society that does not accept it. Go Shirley.   I have heard people complain that this album is more straight-up rock n'roll and less "electronic" than 2.0, but that is the hallmark of a great band. The Beatles had "Sgt. Pepper" as well as "Let it Be". Led Zeppelin did "Black Dog" as well as "Tangerine." Great bands have range.   Garbage is the only band I love that came out of the 90's. And they're still rockin' in the 2000's. Listening to this album has helped me alot through some recent times. There are some very uplifting songs, as well as some songs that are so deep, true, and sad that they make me cry. Beautifully written.  I saw Garbage in concert in Spring '05. Shirley Manson is even more jaw-droppingly captivating in person. Rock on, Garbage! And thank you for all the great music.+music
A Work of Art. Masterpiece.+P+What an album. Easily one of my favorites. It's one that deserves to be listened to on a high end music system. I have my albums that I like on my iPod, or in the car. This is one I like to dedicate my time to without distractions. Bought it the day it came out and has only gotten better with time. My musical tastes usually fall within the electronic/downbeat domain (Air, Boards of Canada, Herbert, Fila Brazilla, Autechre..etc) I do own Listen Without Prejudice, but Older is a much more sophisticated, well rounded album. Mr. Michael's vocals are smooth and lush. First review I've ever done on Amazon, couldn't have picked a better album to start with. +music
Jump at chance to be at  Walter Trout & the Radicals gig+P+If you are looking for a man and a band who can give you everything they've got; look no further.  If you are searching for music that will sear into your soul; look no further.  Walter Trout can play his guitar up there with the best of them.  He can also DO things with a guitar that will leave you speechless.  In his hands, the instrument can wail, talk, cry, moan, whisper or do anything he asks of it.  His singing voice is powerful and comes from the depths of his heart.  He truly presents his all to you in this live performance CD.  His energy will be transferred to you and be engraved into your memory and you will be grateful you found your way to the performance venue of this remarkable musician and his band.  The next best thing to being there is this 2 CD album+music
Just Listen!+P+I read some of the other reviews and thought it was kind of silly for people to try and analyze which BG album is better....what does it really matter? This is a great(band)and they create thoroughly terrific music. I happen to think that Talk To La Bomb is pretty fantastic, unlike anything else that is out there. Let's remember just how horrible and bad the music industry is right now and let's just enjoy talented musicians like BG that go unnoticed for the most part,except by critics and nobody listens to them anymore either!+music
This is the best for dancing to+P+i can't stop dancin to this!it's the BEST ever i can't help it well i'm to busy dancin and maybe u will 2+music
Bing was unquestionably the king of Christmas music+P+There are plenty of Christmas CDs by Bing Crosby that you could get, most of them are at least as good if not slightly better than this one. However, one very good thing about this CD is that it provides Bing Crosby in very good voice singing Christmas standards at an excellent price. These recordings were from old radio shows, and, while that means that there is a mild radio hiss in the background. I personally think that this adds a little magic and character to the CD. If you agree and are on a somewhat limited budget, then you should definitely think about adding this Crosby classic to your Christmas collection+music
Disney Karaoke Vol.2 [KARAOKE]+N+Quite disappointed that there are no screen lyrics available. Although some say karaoke is merely singing the lyrics to the instrumental version of the song, modern day tapes and cd's *do* include the &quot;CDG&quot;.  Disney seems to fall behind the times.  You're better off with a sing-along video -- at least then the kids might learn to read (or at least recognize words). My 4 &amp; 2 year olds wouldn't know what to do with just the instrumental version, of 'true' karaoke. I  do prefer vol2 over vol1 or vol3+music
undeserving of praise+N+my inability to see what's so great about this album does not stem from my lack of experience with "experimental" or "electronic" music.  nor does it reflect my feeling about bands that change their sound on every album.  the problem with this album is that it lacks what ulver are ordinarily pretty good at.  when they explored the folky territory of kveldssanger, the raw black metal of nattens madrigal, and even the ambitious and remarkably diverse william blake album, they slipped more effortlessly into the style.  a few "soundscape" albums, and a couple more blippy ep's later, they come up with this mess.  and i say mess, because that's really what it sounds like to me.  it's as though they wanted to hang onto some of the elements of "quick fix for melancholy" but incorporate the experimental weirdness of label mate when (yes, that's the name of the band:  when), almost to a worshipful extent at times.  unfortunately the result isn't nearly as brilliant, in my opinion, to the aforementioned solo project.  rather it sounds like a bit of a monstrosity that's been shined up a bit by garm's silky crooning (the silkiness of which gets on my nerves after a short while).  of course, this is my opinion.  i don't ordinarily find it necessary to write bad reviews like this, but when i see something like this that isn't really all that unique or amazing get a lot of praise, it rubs me the wrong way. +music
underated+P+This is a great album, it's a mixture of pop and rock. The first side is flawless, but side two let's us down a bit.  Actually 'coming soon' is the only song I don't like on this album. The game is queens first and probably best 80's album+music
The road to future greatness+P+In 1963, the Kelly/Chambers/Cobb rhythm section packed up and left, leaving Miles Davis without a band.  Despite being at an age when most musicians would rather sit on their laurels and play on some giants of jazz tour, he decided to assemble a new working band.  This CD shows that assembly in progress.  The three ballads were recorded in LA with George Coleman (tenor sax), Victor Feldman (piano), Ron Carter (bass), and Frank Butler (drums).  &quot;Basin Street Blues&quot; is very different from Louis Armstrong's version -- Davis's trumpet playing is much sadder, merging abstraction and the blues.  But the real treasures in the set are the three tunes recorded one month later with Carter, Coleman, and two younger musicians: pianist Herbie Hancock and drumming prodigy Tony Williams.  Williams, only 17 years old here, generates an incredible level of excitement on &quot;Joshua&quot; and the title track.  These may be the most exciting up-tempo tracks Davis had recorded since &quot;Two Bass Hit&quot; and &quot;Straight, No Chaser&quot;.  The quintet with Coleman, Hancock, Carter and Williams would soon evolve into one of the trumpeter's greatest groups, and this is where they got started+music
Its okay+N+Ya this CD is okay.  Its just really generic nu-metal.  I like nu-metal a lot its just some it sounds the same and brings nothing new and that is Linken Park.  I don't hate this, I just think it is kind of boring and not that cool.  Partially why this does not get 3 stars is that since this band got so big for a while you kind of expect it to be great nu-metal, but its just plain.  Not great, not terrible+music
fresh fruit for rotting vegetables is all you really need by DK+N+maybe frankencrist if you really enjoy fresh fruit....this is a very annoying and bad b-sides album...california uber alles and holiday in cambodia are over-produced and watered down...and where is the killer intro to holiday in cambodia?  yeah i like jello biafra's voice and his mixture of funny and scary themes hit the spot, but this album consists of b-sides for a reason...aka they werent good enough to go on anything else+music
Great idea...so so execution+N+I don't get all the rave reviews here.  I've owned this CD since it came out in 1997 and its been probably more than 5 years since I had a desire to listen to it.  Now listening to it trying to figure out what I want to put on my I-pod and I really can't find anything other than the 1st 2 tracks, which are great.  The Filter/Crystal Method track is a classic.  But beyond that I just find the songs somewhere between mildly interesting and boring.  I am a fan of many of the rock & electronic artists here, but this experiment just didn't pan out in my opinion.  It's been 10 years and I haven't seen any other collections like this so I must not be in the minority.  Nice try, but there is not much more here beyond the concept+music
One of the few Slayer albums that you can skip.  +N+Live Undead isn't a must have to be in your collection of Slayer albums.  This record only provides evidence of the greedy Metal Blade record label.  Some people say that they threw in an audience sample afterwards to create a fake live album.  Well it is and it isn't.  This isn't a concert, but it's a real audience.  This is slayer simply rehearsing 7 of their songs from Show No Mercy and Haunting the Chapel and they brought about 20 or more fans into the studio or whatever to hear them play.  On the plus side, several of these songs are played better than the originals, however the production is terrible.  A possible reason for this is that Brian Slagel and Metal Blade released this without permission from Slayer, at the time they knew nothing about it.  What is here is early slayer, just beginning to develop their true sound, but it's only 23 minutes in length and Metal blade is asking 17 dollars for it?  But as fellow reviewer FU2 put it, Here's what they should have done, take all four Metal blade releases, remaster them, maybe add some bonus tracks and release them as 2 discs with maybe Show No Mercy/Haunting the Chapel and Hell Awaits/Live Undead or something similar.  But here is the real kicker about this record that is my biggest complaint.  On most early versions (Vinyl and first CD release and some Imports) there is a redone version of CHEMICAL WARFARE as a untitled track with better quality than the original that can no longer be found on this release.  Why?  I have no idea.    If you are planning to get this, chances are you are a fanatic, and personally, this is the only slayer release that I have yet to see in a CD store.  I recommend finding this off eBay, and maybe the Vinyl version as that is a picture disc and is a really cool thing to look at and features the picture on the back of the case with the band playing but with a hole in Tom's face for the record player.    I give this two stars because this isn't worth the price that they are asking for.  This is listenable but there are plenty of other bootlegs out there with more songs if that is what you are looking for, because that is exactly what this is.  Metal blade's cash in on Slayer because as I stated before, Slayer knew nothing about this until it was released.  I couldn't possibly give anything from Slayer a One star because that just doesn't seem possible, as the talent is present, but this thing just doesn't have very good sound and isn't worth the price and once again, only for fanatics.  Hoped this helped.    Interesting fact: That after this was released; the band called the Undead released a live album called Live Slayer+music
Outtakes of imitation folk music that didn't make the doc+N+Hardly any of this music was heard in the wonderful documentary series. A poor album by a decent fiddler but a genuinely lousy composer+music
Virtuoso Guitar Playing, Complex Musical Structures!+N+Here we go again....another tortured collection of three chord, twelve barre Delta Blues. In truth, these songs were redundant and whiny when the very limited Robert Johnson first recorded them; now hearing Clapton ressurect them is just plain annoying. How many times can we hear "I woke up this morning, baby; My cow just up and died.....da dum, da dum, da dum.....I woke up this morning, baby. My cow just up and died. Da dum, da dum, da dum.... So I drank a bottle of hooch and I began to cry....da dum, da dum, da dum...." Come on, people! If this is genius songwriting and guitar playing then we should all simply throw in the towel on civilization. When Eric Clapton plays Cole Porter, Duke Ellington, and Rogers and Hart on his guitar---unaccompanied----chords, melody and bass line----like Django Reinhardt, Wes Montgomery, and Joe Pass----then maybe I'll consider him a great guitarist. Today's youth are clueless about almost everything, and guitar virtuosity is no exception. I don't believe Clapton has ever heard of key modulation, arpeggios, or chord substitutions. In truth, he is an average rock guitarist, and considering the primative structure of rock and roll guitar playing, that's not saying much. For anyone to call him a great guitarist, let alone the greatest guitarist whoever lived, is indicative of either juvenile delinquency or just plain stupidity. It's like saying Madonna is the greatest singer of all time. Odds are those who make such vacuous, ludicrous statements are the children or grandchildren of the druggie Woodstock generation who wouldn't know a great guitarist if he/she tripped over him (which would be likely since they were all drugged out of their minds most of the time). I know we're living in the age of grand mediocrity, but enough is enough. Go buy a Wes Montgomery, Django Reinhardt or Barney Kessel album and listen to sophisticated, nuanced, and soulful guitar viruosity. If you have half a brain, you'll throw away your collection of rock guitar icons and beg foregiveness for being such an uneducated, unsophisticated nitwit who once claimed that one-dimensional druggies like Clapton and Hendrix were great guitarists. If after listening to these truly talented guitarists who actually play more than three chords you still hold to your position that Clapton is a great guitarist, here's what you do: pick up your Fender Strat, turn the amp volume up to 10, smoke a joint, and go stick your head between your distortion chambers and fuzz boxes and make a lot of noise and pretend you too are a great guitarist. Eric Clapton is a great guitarist! What a dumb society we have wrought since the late 1960s.+music
Very good musicians, but this leaves me cold+N+Let me preface this by saying I am a big fan of traditional Irish music, and a huge fan of Dervish, Trian, Liz Carroll, Bothy Band, Kevin Burke, Andy Irvine, etc.  This is the first Solas CD I have bought, and will probably be the last.  Although generally very competently played, the music just doesn't speak to me.  I agree with the some of the other reviews to that effect that this Solas recording is too highly orchestrated, and not very traditional (though I don't mind that, per se).  In my opinion &quot;Last of the Great Whales&quot; has some of the lamest and simple-minded lyrics I've ever heard. Though she has a very pleasing voice, Ms. Scanlon's rendition of it just fails to move me whatsoever (lacking in musicality, I believe one reviewer said).  In my book her renditions just don't compare to Mary Black, Susan McKeown, or Karan Casey, though they are pleasant enough.  The fiddle playing on &quot;A Little Child&quot; reminds me more of a classical violinist playing Irish music....very good tone, but too much vibrato, and too orchestrated with multiple violin tracks sounding like the London Philharmonic (e.g. When My Love &amp; I Parted).  On the positive side, there is some excellent guitar, flute, and button accordian playing on here (e.g. Cahil's Jig).  It's as if the band is trying too hard to distance themselves from the many other traditional Irish groups, with the result that the arrangements are overly complex, and the material just isn't that interesting+music
Good, But Not Nearly As Good... :(+N+It's a good CD, but it's not nearly as good as what Solas has done so far. They came to Portland a few weeks ago, but before I bought my tickets to the show I bought this CD. I listened to it, and was dissapointed. I decided to not go to the show, and I'm a BIG Irish music fan! It's too bad Karen left the band, because she really had a charming voice and sytle, but I have to say this new lady (I haven't even checked to see who she is!) is just not as much fun as Karen. She can sing, that's for sure, but so can a lot of people! The band's instrumental dance sets are more of the same, but I have to admit I'm getting a bit tired of the guitarist's chunky style. I did notice that the fiddler has got a bit wilder, which is great. Overall, if you are a diehard Solas fan, you'd like to own this CD. If you're a fan of good Irish music, you probably wont listen to this CD more than a few times+music
About time...+P+Like many I owned this in Vinyl and was amazed it took so long To come out. And to those who said they found this album a little bit sappy, I say "So the hell what." Everything in that era was sappy and if your worried that a little sappiness may alter your manhood then I recommend against the purchase of this Cd. But if you want to listen to something thats gonna make you feel pretty damn good this is it. S&C have a well blended album here. The well known and recognized "Diamond girl" followed by  "Ruby jean and Billy Lee"leads it off. Both were big hits and still sound good. "Intone my servant" follows and though not a hit you'll wonder why. like all the others a beautifully uplifting harmonic piece. "We may never pass this way again" another hit shows once again how S&C can change a beautifull melody and lift your soul right out of your body and make it fly. "Nine houses" starts off kinda odd (The song has a mid east flare to it) but hear it out. Vocals will come in lator and pick it up. "Standing on a mountain top" by far is one of my favorites a great countryish sound and a really great sounding guitar in this one that'll make you feel like dancing and singing to it. "It's gonna come down on you" a minor hit shoulda been "major" starts off mellow and beautifull and like most of there songs in this album just lifts you right up with an increase in tempo.  "Jessica" has got to be the most sappy song of the bunch. But, Hey! my niece's name is "Jessica and It was once a favorite of mine and still is a beautifull song. ""Dust on my saddle" A country diddy that you may find yourself singing word for word after some time. "Wisdom" is the only song I never listen to its a jazzy piece and I dont care for Jazz much but even I gotta admit they do show off their talent on the horns. In short this is a great album from beginning to end (Which is rare to find nowadays) and really represents the times in which it was written (Early 70's) ENJOY      +music
Vintage folk-rock tunes clearly rooted to the mid-70s +P+Diamond Girl" is a vintage collection of folk-rock tunes clearly rooted to the mid-70s and one of the finer albums to emerge from that cluttered genre. Though Seals and Crofts were a duo, their fine-honed sound would not have caught the public's ear without the able assistance of producer Louie Shelton, who really shaped and smoothed their sound, and multi-instrumentalist Jim Lichtig, who shares writing credits for several Seals and Crofts' songs. A cast of fine session musicians contribute as well, and the set.   I would say that nearly all of us who listened to the radio back when this CD was popular will always recognize the opening chords of Diamond Girl within a millisecond and drew comfort and permission from the philosophy in We May Never Pass This Way (Again). This CD has other jewels as well, Nine Houses, Jessica, and Wisdom, and all in all contains more Baha'i themes than some find comfortable. A pair of older tracks, such as Dust on My Saddle and Standin' on a Mountain Top, both penned before there was a Seals and Crofts, do not hold up as well.         Note that this CD is not actually a Warner Brothers release, which may bode well for those, like myself, hoping to see more of this duo's catalog appear on CD. After their antiabortion stance on a later recording, "Unborn Child," the band's popularity began to wane and they found themselves being judged more on politics than music.+music
A bit heavy on the band side of &quot;Pipes &amp; Drums &amp; Band&quot;+P+I bought this CD hoping to get the definitive recording of mass pipes and band playing Amazing Grace.  I was not totally disappointed, but I already had a version that I think I like better which is on a CD entitled &quot;The Music of Scotland: The Scottish National Pipe &amp; Drum Corps and Military Band&quot;.  The sound quality is better and the transition from the first stanza of solo piper to massed pipes in the second stanza is smoother in terms of the introduction of the drones.  The arrangement is basically the same except that it doesn't have the extra flourish at the end of the third stanza before returning to the solo piper.  The &quot;National Pipe and Drum&quot; CD also has more emphasis on pipes &amp; drums and less on military band than does the &quot;Dragoon Guards&quot; CD.  Unfortunately I cannot find the former CD listed on Amazon.  There is, however, nothing more stirring than &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; played with massed pipes--no matter which one you get+music
well done+P+I bought this cd and fell in love with it. If your a Peter White fan Click that add to shopping cart botton+music
His Intersperced Mediocity+N+This is not HIM's best album. It does live up to it's name because is more metal-y, but the guitars are louder, and the tunes just aren't as catchy. I would recomend "Dark Light" much more+music
Call Me In the Morning+P+With some great recent soundtracks from "Ladder 49," "The Aviator" & "Wicker Park," I thought it would be great to revisit this classic soundtrack from 1998.  "Practical Magic" holds up well 7 years after its release as a song collection.  My favorite is Nilsson's "Coconut."  It's interesting that the producers use his first name since he always went by just his last name on his own releases.  However, that track with "put the lime in the coconut & drink it all up, call me in the morning & I'll tell you what to do" is just the classic feel good track.  Joni Mitchell's "A Case of You" from her classic "Blue" album sounds at home in this set, "I'm a lonely painter; I live in a box of paints; I'm frightened by the devil & I'm drawn to those ones that ain't afraid.  I remember that time you told me love is touching souls, surely you touched mine."  Joni marries such a unique melody with poetic lyrics that any set rises from her inclusion.  Stevie Nicks' two songs are both great inclusions from this enigmatic singer.  "Crystal" builds nicely with her soothing vocals, "I turned around & the water was closing all around like a glove, like the love I finally found me."  The opener "If Ever You Did Believe" has a lovely melody that draws you in with repeated listenings.  Faith Hill's "This Kiss" had to be about the catchiest country song of the 90s & is classic in any setting.  Marvin Gaye's track "Got to Give It Up (Pt. 1)" has an infectious driving beat superimposed over party sounds.  Lisa Hall is not an artist I know, but this track has good energy and drive.  Nick Drake was one of my favorites when he was alive.  His moody folk driven melodies touched a chord as does this track "Black Eyed Dog."  "Practical Magic" is an excellent collection of music.  Enjoy! +music
essentially it+P+An Amazon search of 'Essential' under music turns up over 1,700 hits.  While they may not all be winners, if you're looking for an affordable one-disc compilation of Janis Joplin recordings, you couldn't do much better than this.  The nice thing about '18 Essential Songs' (drawn from the 49 track 1993 box set titled 'Janis') is that a number of the selections are alternates or live versions of well-worn tracks, so you get a little different spin on the Joplin legacy.  In addition, you get nearly every truly classic recording Janis ever made spanning over seventy minutes of CD space.  At under five bucks for a used copy here at Amazon, you may be able to end your search here.  The offerings begin with one of Janis' earliest recorded tracks, a rendition of the blues classic 'Trouble In Mind'.  Although it is historic, Janis' vocals seem to be struggling to emerge from a cave.  Hit the skip button after a cursory listen, and move on to the goodies.  'Down On Me', while not as deliciously raw and punchy as the live version recorded at the Grande Ballroom in Detroit, certainly kicks Janis' locomotive vocal cords into high gear.  Familiar studio tracks such as 'Piece Of My Heart', 'Try (Just a Little Bit Harder)', 'Kozmic Blues', 'Move Over', 'Get It While You Can', and 'Half Moon' mix with a previously unreleased version of 'Ball and Chain' (all eight minutes plus from the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival), an alternate demo take of 'Summertime' from the musical 'Porgy and Bess', a live version of 'Raise Your Hand' from the Ed Sullivan Show' (a portion of which made it onto the 'Very Best Of the Ed Sullivan Show' video compilation), and a nearly six-minute live wailing blues version of 'Tell Mama'.  Most refreshing is the closer, an alternate demo recording of 'Me and Bobby McGee', featuring just Janis and an acoustic guitar, melting this composition down to its essential elements.  'Trust Me' is offered as one of the few non-blues or rock oriented tracks.  It's a nice romantic ballad, but comes too late in the set to be breaking up whatever monotony is induced by the dominance of the blues.  A few lesser-known tracks such as 'I Need a Man To Love' and 'One Good Man' might make things interesting, but are less than essential.  The only 'essential song' I could without is the mercilessly overplayed 'Mercedes Benz', which graciously clocks out at 1:46 as the shortest track on the disc.  '18 Essential Songs' is a compelling entry into the Janis Joplin compilation sweepstakes, which features two full box sets, and at least 10 single disc 'greatest hits' style collections.  If you're not inclined to purchase one of the anthologies, however, this may well be the pick of the litter. +music
Worth every cent, penny, or other currency!+P+DJ Kid Koala is probably one of the better DJs today, in standards of both technique and creativity. His skill allows him to take basically every quote he would like and to mix it into the flow. Texts and sounds as one, he manages to make it appear like a new, whole piece - which is exactly what a true DJ supposed to do.  By Redefining the art of turntables, he has in this specific album all that's needed - a bit of dark tracks, a bit of laughable samples; and all in all, if you like the genre, this album is a must+music
All Hail+P+Queen Latifah Knows...this album was spectacular...it is uplifting and has good beats and anybody who has the nerve to even say a fool like 50 cent or a no talent joke like ja rule is anything better than her has nerve because she is history..she is what 50 and Ja bite off of...she is what they can't live up to...so know your history before you praise the present...but queen, you gotta represent!!+music
Amazing recordings from an amazing artist+P+It's always wise to be thankful for little miracles. That Mississippi John Hurt was "rediscovered" living only a mile away from the crossroads hamlet of Avalon, MS, deduced from the title of a 78-rpm recording he'd made in 1928, by a young guitar player from Washington, DC, named Tom Hoskins, is a miracle we all should be grateful for. That Hurt could still play and sing as well in 1963 when Hoskins found him as he did in 1928 is another praiseworthy miracle. Finally, that the Library of Congress showed the interest and was able to induce Hurt to come to the Coolidge Auditorium in DC in July of 1963 and record dozens of songs as the crowning achievement of his legacy is perhaps the biggest miracle of all, capped off with the fact that all of us now can enjoy those recorded gems with this double-CD set.   Hurt was one of the most lyrical country blues artists who ever lived. He was born and lived his whole life in the Delta, yet he was untouched and uninfluenced by the great Delta musicians (Patton, Johnson, Skip James, et.al.) and their gruff, extroverted singing and string-busting guitar-playing tradition. Hurt sang in a deep, quiet voice and played intricate, even delicate, patterns on his guitar. The masterpieces from'27 (CANDY MAN, STACKOLEE, LOUIS COLLINS, NOBODY'S DIRTY BUSINESS, and, of course, AVALON BLUES) are all revived here and sound just as good as they did back in '28 (the sound, of course, is much better). There are 35 titles in this 2-CD set and every one is a beauty. John Hurt is a national treasure and these LoC recordings are a testament to his genius. Definitely grab these CDs (hopefully Fuel will issue the remaining unissued sides in Volume 2) and then get the 1928 Okeh recordings (on a Columbia CD) and, finally, check out Hurt's Newport and other post-rediscovery albums on Vanguard (on a nice 3-CD set). You will not be disappointed - the man was amazing. +music
Tapestry - Carole King+P+THIS IS A GREAT ALBUM!  This is my all-time absolute favorite collection.  I have the vinyl LP from the 70s, then later I bought the cassette, and then later the CD - I even have the "Tapestry Revisited" CD (the Tapestry songs re-recorded by various artists) and coffee mug from several years back. EVERYONE should have this collection on some form+music
A cinematic return to form+P+This is one of my favorite Prince albums. It's incredibly cinematic and creative. His voice sounds amazing and he really sounds more inspired than he has in years. The production is also fantastic. Discovering this record was one of the best music experiences I have EVER had. It was right when I was starting to explore Prince's catalogue (started listening to him in 2003). I had no idea what the record was about and the way Rainbow Children goes into Muse 2 the Pharaoh, it's beautiful. Beautiful music. There is this deep Darth Vader style voice that annoys a lot of people but to me it just adds to the cinematic quality of the record. I wish there was more music like this. My favorites are probably Rainbow Children Muse 2 the pharaoh Everywhere Everlasting now Last December. Even Wedding Feast is a fun little number. Joins Purple Rain and Sign of the times in my top 3 for Prince.+music
A flop+N+The 80's was a really bad time for Alice Cooper. He had  become a joke of his old self. He tried to do what Aerosmith did with P Vacation and comeback with a hair metal commerical album, but he flatout fails.   The guitar playing isn't that bad at all, but the lyrics are  cheesy making even the decent songs like Teenage Frankenstein,  He's Back and Crawlin pretty much guilty pleasures. The rest of the album is pure 80's mediocrity+music
OH  MY!!  +N+When I heard the song "I WOn't Stand In LIne" I thought to myself...neither will I...meaning "I Won't Stand In LIne" to buy any of this lady's music!!  This CD has some of the worst songs I've ever heard in my life like the one above, "I Wouldn't Wanna Be You", and "Everything You Want".  "Why Haven't I Heard From You" gets on my last nerve!!  There really is not much redeemable about this release.  Its got a nice cover with a flattering picture of Reba on the front of it but that's about it!!  Read my mind....it stinks!+music
All Day and All Night you can listen to this set+P+When the Wailers were signed to island records in 1972, this marked the beginning of reggae to an international audience. The Wailers were already famous throughout the Carribbean, but worldwide they were nobody's. Catch a Fire changed all that. This was packaged as a rock album and the original album sleeve was actually a zippo lighter and when you opened the lighter the record would come out. This artwork is not original. The sound tapes were actually overdubbed with rock giutars and other instruments to make this album appeal to an American and English audience.  The first disc is all the original Jamaican takes which are better then the overdubbed ones released originally to the world in 1972.  The original Mixes have such a feel to them, and you can really appreciate why this band was so big in the Carribbean.  The Wailers first album has a feel unlike any other Bob Marley, Peter Tosh, or Bunny Wailer solo album.  the three of them together were simply amazing and no vocal trio will ever equal how good this band was.  With the Barrett brothers on drums and bass and a young Tyrone Downie on the keyobards, this band was well on the path to stardom, and Catch a Fire was the start. If you have a music collection, you need this Deluxe Edition in your collection+music
A great sampling of Tony Rice guitar+P+As a long-time Tony Rice fan, this CD is a great compilation of some of his best.  Very good listening+music
I can't believe some people don't like this stuff!+P+Some of the past reveiwers complained about a few things about this album, usually one of the following:  1.  The material isn't new.  2.  The material is unoriginal.  3.  The material isn't "edgy" enough.  So, here are my rebuttals to these complaints, in hopes of straigtening a few things out (sarcasm intended, since I'm sure they really don't care):  1.  Of course it isn't new material, its called "I'm telling you for the LAST time."  Its really more of a greatest hits performance since Jerry Seinfeld never released an album.  I agree it would have been cool to have some of his earlier performances on an album, but we don't have the luxury, and I don't know about you, but I'd perfer to have my Seinfeld stand up actually documented on a disc as opposed to the previous option, one minute chunks before and after an episode of his sitcom.  2.  There was a time when this actually was quite original.  You see, Jerry Seinfeld got incredibly famous, and so many up and coming comedians started ripping him off that his observational comedic stylings became very common (a point beautifully illustrated in the SNL game show parody "Stand Up and Win" hosted by Jerry Seinfeld himself).  If the material and style sounds unoriginal, keep in mind, Seinfeld pretty much did it first.  3.  Why should comedy have to be "edgy" to be good?  Jerry Seinfeld was funny without being dirty or obscene (the worst you hear in this CD is a handfull of "G-d D-mns").  I personally think that the R rated material is a crutch, if you can't be funny without being dirty, then you're not really that good in the first place.  So there you have it, my takes on the complaints against Seinfelds only album.  It's some good stuff really, there's a reason why people ripped off his act, and that reason is because he was a really funny, really sucessful comedian+music
Worth checking out+N+Jerry is one of history's great stand up comedians, no doubt. That is why this is worth listening to. Be aware that yes, there is a lot of material on here that is old. Basically stuff you might have seen Jerry perform on an HBO special back in like 1982. I think since he regrettably never released a stand up record before he decided to use a lot of this to preserve it on a CD. That in conjunction with the fact that he might not have had that much new material. I wish he had vintage stuff of him recorded from small comedy clubs back in the 80s. I always prefer on a comedy record that it is performed in a small club as opposed to a huge arena or hall. You definitely lose all of the intimacy that I think makes for the best stand up comedy experience. All in all since this is Jerry's one and only comedy record it is certainly worth checking out, let's face it a mediocre Jerry output is better than a lot of comedians best stuff.+music
From Rags To Beautiful Songs+P+Tisha Campbell is a underrated actress with a big beautiful singing voice.  While America gives these bitches like Ashanti, Britney, Hilary and Lindsay the limelight and pass on Tisha!  Not right yall!  Every song on this album is slamming.  Capitol should have done a better job promoting this wonderful album.  "Push" is a funky track which enlisted the help of Tichina Arnold on backgrounds.  "All Good Things Come In Time" is a quiet storm classic song.  "Brokenhearted" is a slice of perfect pitch heaven.  "Love's Got A Hold On Me" is a sexy slow number that captivates any ole heart.  So in parting, the next time somebody complains about not any real singers, cop this album.  How does America think that Britney, Ashanti, Hillary and Lindsay have vocal talents?  I have Britney & Ashanti.  These girls need to go to vocal camp and learn a thing or two from Ms. Campbell Martin.  These girls couldn't hold a candle next to Tisha's four octaves.  Think about that, the next time yall complain about no talent girls+music
An absolute waste of money+N+Do yourselves a favour kids, save your money don't go to the show,i mean don't buy this soundtrack. Here are some tips about it. It runs for a mere 29 minutes. That's awfully short. There are 8 songs and 8 portions of dialogue. most of these portions of dialogue last a few seconds, radio announcements of songs. The best portion is the harvey keitel bit, 'if the manager thinks he's Charles Bronson, cut off one of his fingers'. The songs now. Little green is a decent enough song, cocunut is a good song. i gotcha is okay. Stuck in the middle with you is a good song but has been ruined for me because it has been played to death on tv and radio. The other 4 songs are a joke. so basically it's a total waste of money. The pulp fiction soundtrack is a lot better than this one. Stop+music
Old songs - Great sound still resonates+P+Nostalgia filled me as I listened to some of the most eloquent and poignant songs ever written and sung by the infamous Michael Hutchence, taking me back to the age of sixteen and absolutely loving the passion that surrounded this band. It was great to be re-aquinted with songs that opened up wonderful memories and experiences. Definitely a must have for any CD collection+music
AN ABSOLUTE CRIME+N+One of the few documentaries that has actually meant something to me and generations of like minded folks. It is such a shame that this is the best that could be done as a means of representing the movie. Were Kazaa alive today I would create my own cd following the chronological order of the closing credits. Well, worse has been done (i.e. Bush + Iraq) so I should not complain, but instead I'll protest and not buy this incredibly lame misrepresentation of an incredibly well made documentary+music
OH NO, ITS ICE CREAM MUSIC+N+21/2 SCOOPS OUT OF  FIVE.  OBVIOUSLY SOME VERY TALENTED PLAYERS HERE, SOME MOMENTS OF COMPLEXITY HERE AND THERE, BUT THE MATERIAL IS POOPY. FOR MY PERSONAL TATSE, THIS WOULD GET A BIG FAT LONELY STAR, BUT IT'S NOT REALLY BAD MUSIC, I JUST COULD NOT GET IT. THE PRODUCTION IS TYPICAL OF EARLY 90'S, WAY OVERDONE, SHINY, ARTIFICIAL, THERE'S NO PROPER SPACIAL IMAGERY AT ALL. CAN YOU SAY COMPRESSION? YUCK. NOT THE GREASY, SWEATY FUNK FROM THE 70'S. MADE ME THINK OF BEING IN AN ICE CREAM PARLOR AT TIMES. WERE THESE TRACKS LEFTOVERS FROM BAD 1989-90 SESSIONS OR WHAT+music
No comment!+N+Oops I almost forgot the song by Tom Jones called &quot;Thunderball&quot; is on here. What I meant to say was about his tunes were &quot;Kiss&quot; &amp; &quot;Puppet Man&quot; that's all+music
Coltrane at his most powerful+P+Although "A Love Supreme" is generally regarded as Coltrane's most emotional album, "Sun Ship" tops it in intensity and passion. The music is volatile, from lush McCoy Tyner passages and Coltrane themes, to Elvin Jones's furious percussion and Coltrane's atonal improvisation. Coltrane's solos on the title track and "Amen" are guaranteed to give you goosebumps, if you "get" his later stuff+music
One of the few greatest hits albums that actually satisfy+P+When it comes to "best of's" and compilations, very rarely can a collection successfully comprise a solid overview of a band's catalog.  The Smashing Pumpkins' "Greatest Hits" is one of the few of these collections that actually satisfies, providing a very solid overview of the songs that propelled the band to stardom.  Singles from "Gish" to "Machina: The Machines of God" are covered here, as well as "Eye" from the soundtrack to David Lynch's Lost Highway, and unreleased songs "Real Love" and "Untitled", which are actually pretty good as well.  The only real downsides to this compilation are that no other non-singles are covered here, and the CD booklet features no kind of commentary at all from any of the band members.  That aside, for casual fans of the Smashing Pumpkins, "Greatest Hits" isn't a bad pick up at all+music
All you have to do is dream...+P+For all the fans of the original Broadway musical soundtrack of "Dreamgirls," their dreams have come true with this 25th-year anniversary special edition cd.  Included are all the original tracks from the Dreamgirls soundtrack and three previously unreleased recordings of "Driving Down the Strip" "It's All Over" and a reprise of the title track "Dreamgirls" for the finale.   A second cd has instrumental versions of some of the stand out tracks including "And I am Telling You I'm Not Going" and "One Night Only."  The album has been remastered and it does sound louder with more bass than the original, but there are some instances where Jennifer Holliday's voice begins to blare. That's probably due to the fact that Holliday is such a powerful singer and the decibel levels went into the red when they were recording the original master tapes, so it can't be helped. However, the added tracks sound very crisp and clear.  Also included in this special edition cd is a booklet containing an intro by Henry Krieger(song writer for additional music in the motion picture Dreamgirls), the original liner notes with photos from the stage production, and lyrics to all the songs.  I would have given this set five stars but the song "Heavy" isn't on here, neither is the disco version of "One Night Only." From what I understand, we're lucky to get the three previously unreleased tracks! Legend has it that Geffen did not want to produce a double length album with three virtually unknown singers, which explains the omission of some songs and the remixing of two different versions of "One Night Only" down to one track. Also, he wanted the best possible sound quality for the original album.  The inlcusion of "It's All Over" is well worth the price of this cd. The climactic show-down between the three girls, the replacement, and the boss brings a new perspective to the show stopping song "And I'm Telling You..."   One more thing, there seems to be some confusion between this cd and the one coming out for the motion picture "Dreamgirls." This is the ORIGINAL BROADWAY RECORDING of the musical. Beyonce and Jenifer Hudson are not on this cd. But Jennifer Holliday, Sheryl Lee Ralph and Loretta Devine shine as the original DREAMS+music
Excellent+P+Wonderful Group!!!!! Great all-time favorites on this CD. Highly recommend this CD to al+music
Dissapointed+N+I was dissapointed when I listened to this cd.  All I wanted was the original version of the Perfect Drug.  This cd only has the remixes.  So if you're buying this cd for the original version, you should just as well buy the soundtrack for the Lost Highway instead+music
I guess one would call this Soft Cheese.+N+With the exception of a few of their more recent live albums, I have just about everything SCI has put out.  I became a fan only relatively recently, but once I got one (starting with their collaboration with Kellar Williams), I got hooked and can't stop.  But this album left me disappointed.  It was slow and stripped down.  As several have said before me, none of the jams, none of the joy, none of the humor, nor the can't-stop-moving musicality of basically every other release by these guys, whether live or in the studio.  Everything else - ANYthing else- they've done is just better.  Buy if you want to have a complete collection of their work, but if you're a first-time buyer, don't go here, because it's not representative of just how fantastic they are.  Had this been the first album I got from them, I would not have bought more and would've missed the unbelievable experience I have every time I listen to virtually everything else they've done.+music
Big mistake / lost opportunity+N+The point has come that nearly all great recordings have been remastered in some way, shape or form and subsequently re-released. Because of that I decided to get an iPod strictly for the purpose of "collecting" as many of my favorites as possible. My plan has been to buy most of them from Amazon or an Amazon seller & then put them on the pod. So much of my favorite music has been re-mastered (makes me feel old.. maybe cuz I am!) that this has become quite a project! Anyway, almost every re-mastered CD I've picked up has sounded better than the original. Some are improved so much that it's as if the album seems like a brand new release (PSBWB is a phenomenal example).  Anyhow, I didn't realize that CTE was remastered AND remixed when I bought it. I expected it to be like all the other remasters I've listened to - a favorite album with much better clarity and a lot more boom.  Countdown to Extinction is a masterpiece as far as I'm concerned, even though my favorite Megadeath album is probably Peace Sells.  Countdown was (when first released) absolutely perfect - something no other Megadeath album had been. Dave had recently gotten sober if I recall corectly, and that along with the new guys made this a new sound with much more maturity than before. It was landmark to be sure. Did I mention it was perect?  The reMIX was a horrible mistake in my book. If Dave wanted a remix for himself & burned it during the remaster work that would have been fine - but to release the so-called "Remastered" CTE in a completely different form SUCKS - I feel ripped off. I want the opportunity to own CTE in REMASTERED form without anything other than the quality of sound being tweaked. Maybe if enough people complain and continue to do so the nagging will eventually lead to such a release. Dave should be aware that potential NEW Megadeath fans were won over by the thousands with this album, and it probably continues to do so - but if the average CD of CTE floating around on the net or on store shelves 5 years from now is the remaster (and thus ALSO reMIXed), it will likely not win the new listener over. That's sad, because CTE is Megadeath's "Black" album - and the remix is a completely different album with completely different songs. It is not a remix or a remaster, it's a new release. Had this remixed version been what was released when CTE originally came out, it wouldn't be worth issuing as a remaster in the first place.  I WANT MY CTE REMASTER!!!!  +music
They don't come like this anymore+P+Sometimes you just want to be transported to a different musical universe,to a time when everything was possible.From the outrageous clothes of Alphonse on the cover(why are we so boring these days?)to the fantastic tight energetic playing of everyone involved, this is a CD that holds up remarkably well.The sound quality on my CD is amazing, and if you think jazz fusion means unstructured noodling then you couldn't be further from the truth with this disc.The songs are focused and precise with accessible melodies and inspired solos.There is a real sort of joy that emanates from this music thats very refreshing in our crazy 21st century world+music
EDDIE AND THE CRUISERS UNRELEASED TAPES+N+I WANT TO KNOW WHY JUST A FEW DAYS AGO, TENDER YEARS WAS ON THIS ALBUM AND WHY IT'S NOT THERE NOW. WITHOUT TENDER YEARS, THIS ALBUM ISN'T WORTH .2/ BELIEVE ME, MY COMPANY WON'T EVEN SPONSOR THE DEEID AND THE CRUISERS ALBUMS  ANYMORE+music
Perfect.+P+I bought 'On Land' this afternoon and have been playing it constantly -- it's been round about six or seven times already. The first time, it sounded utterly familiar, like music I'd heard a long time ago and forgotten. Every time since, it sounds different and new. I already had 'Music for Airports' and 'Plateaux of Mirror' (with Harold Budd), but 'On Land' has convinced me that Eno is, without exaggeration or qualification, a great artist. Even his liner notes are intelligent without being pretentious, a rare achievement for a musician!  Although very superficially similar, it doesn't take long to realize that Eno's ambient works are a world away from the lazy, sonically unadventurous tinklings of countless 'New Age' pieces (many of which were probably inspired by Eno, unfortunately). In 'On Land' every sound is meticulously placed, every treatment thoughtful and, needless to say, beautifully produced. Moving away from the idea of 'performable' music towards pure studio recordings allows a degree of control -- crucially, control of tonal contour and spatial organisation -- that makes these tracks more like aural sculptures than music. That's probably why they sound so different on different systems, in different rooms, at different angles from the sound source etc.  If that makes it sound like an academic exercise, be aware that this is also a very emotional record -- although the emotions communicated are usually obscure, ineffable, almost impalpable. Whereas some of Eno's other ambient works are explicitly NOT to be listened to directly, I can't help feeling that 'On Land' demands more focused attention. It will certainly repay; after just a few hours, it already feels like one of my favourite records+music
You're My Sickness+P+Diva Destruction is another band that I just had to check out without having to listening to their music. I was intrigued by what I have read about them on Metropolis Record's website. It also helped that they are signed to my favorite record label so I had some inkling to what the band sounded like...somewhat. I bought the cd last Thursday and since then I have been listening to the cd non-stop... The in your face production from Scott Humphrey and Frank Gryner knocked me off my feet. I haven't heard such clean production as what I just heard on "Exposing the Sickness". Debra Fogarty's vocals (w/back up vocals from Sharon Blackstone) reminded me a lot of Siouxsie Sioux and Tina and Susan from Switchblade Symphony. Very powerful. Debra could put a lot of today's singers to shame. The bass, drums, guitars, and programming blended well, a mixture of rock and industrial music.    As I am listening to "Exposing the Sickness" again, Diva Destruction reminds me a lot like their fellow labelmates Clan of Xymox and Bella Morte but with female lead singer, especially Bella Morte but with more programming and less guitars. I loved "Exposing the Sickness" right from the get go with the first track "Heathcliff". My favorite songs off this album has to be the remix to "When Trees Would Dance" (as well as the original version), "Tempter", "Valley of the Scars", and "Hypocrite". I definitely plan on acquiring their first album as well as future releases from the band in the near future+music
Unauthorized release+N+This release contains a track by the Egyptian-born U.S. composer Halim El-Dabh which was used without his permission or consent, and for which he is obtaining no royalties.  Please take this into consideration when choosing whether to purchase this recording+music
As Many IQ Points as notes+N+There is nothing remotely heavy and/or musical about this band. Every song uses the same three powerchords, the same drum lines, the same taking-a-dump vocal histrionics, the same lyrics of no substance and one subject. Do yourselves a favor and find something actually artistically worthy of the intelligent mind, and don't be fooled into thinking that this is heavy in any non-primitive way+music
Parallel Universe?+N+People who listen to the Goldberg Variations on piano must live in a parallel universe. Liquid legato? Three minutes of passion? There is no other set of variations of any era for any instrument more "structurally" conceived and unified than the Goldbergs! It's all or nothing, not a string of pearls. Please, please, listen to the harpsichord performances of Trevor Pinnock or Bob van Asperen before you spend money on another pianist's misconception. Ms Tureck's performance, by the way, is particularly inchoate. If you must have piano, try Richard Goode+music
Wake me when it's over+N+I agree with the previous reviewer: this recording contains about three minutes of musical bliss.  The rest of it is self-conscious and belabored+music
excellent album+P+if simply for Kathryn Williams' "Buzzin' Fly" and Stephen Fretwell's rendition of "Morning Theft," this album is worth getting... all the songs are genuinely new takes on these two amazing musicians... highly recommende+music
Time to show my age+P+Saw this group TWICE on this album tour. EXCELLENT. Wore the album out. Have the CD, a must have for true southern rockers+music
Disappointed+N+OK, I'm down with funk, and I've been down with the resergence in fusion/bugaloo/funk/jazz like MMW, Greyboy, Galactic. But I'm sorry, the turkish instruments just do not work here. Try imagining James Brown with  an Irish jig band playing along. Get my point? They just don't mix. Don't  get me wrong, I'm down with BFE. But did they have to throw the turks into  every jam? The mix was just too caustic+music
Chet is Therapy+P+The perfect album for after work; this music really compliments that first wonderful moment when you kick off your shoes, ease your chair back...and relax with a cocktail after a hard day. Chet is my relaxation hero+music
SORRY MARC...JUST DO YOUR THING.+N+I have to say something about this Cd...I mean,I know Marc Anthony tried to do something different this time and he did it,but pop is not his thing..."MENDED" is a weak album,with 2 or 3 good songs as "Love Won't get any better" "She mends me" and maybe even "Tragedy" that's all. I used to be a fan of Marc Anthony's Salsa albums...but this is actually pop from hell. Sorry Marc...Just do your thing+music
the only GOOD rap band!+P+wicked album guys. Got a pre release version of this with a blue cover and DVD and errors on the track listing due to the time limit of a couple of songs. Nelly Furtado guest stars on one of the songs! This is an awesome old school politically orientated rap band who care for our planet. Theve got a new album coming out soon as well. So i guess "Stay Tuned+music
I love Brian setzer's Orch., but...+N+Setzer and his band are sizzlin' hot, and he is my favorite swing band leader, however no matter how many times I try to listen to this cd, I just can't bring myself to like it.  It is just too darn hokey, cheezy, commercial, and corny.  In the Mood is full of energy, and could have been great without the "DJ MIX" club beat intro, and I find the rapping offensive racially.  It sounds as though they are making fun of the rap genere, and mocking the race.  Setzer's vocals never sounded better and hsi guitar playing is great, and band is smokin.  The sonsg americano sucks, and the production value in nill, zero, nana, it's WAY overproduced.  Buy hsi new live 2 cd set instead..+music
One Of The Greatest Albums Ever Made+P+Set the twilgiht reeling truely has every musical element. Lou Reed showcases his ability to produce beautiful meaningful and passionate songs and at the same time also keep a comedic tone. Riptide alone reaches deep down inside you and touches your heart and Soul. Only New York, Berlin and Transformer Almost match this level of quality. Hooky Wooky, Trade In, Adventurer, Finish line, the title track, and Hang onto your emotions are all fantastic. With Great Lyrics, Well Written songs and Unsermountalbe passion, Set The Twilight Reeling truely is one of the greatest albums ever made+music
sexy, calming, energizing!+P+This is not &quot;smooth jazz&quot; in the nauseating sense made famous by certain clarinet players. This rocks. Groovin' baseline, hot licks, great variety of rhythm. This CD is my preferred favorite, many nights running, after fighting L.A. traffic all the way home. Sexy, calming, energizing, -- if someone could bottle what this CD does for me they would make a mint! (You gotta try it!+music
Debut of the most overlooked rock group ever (5 Stars)+P+Supergrass' I Should Coco is a landmark acheivement.  The thought that mere teenagers could recreate an energy not felt since the birth of punk in the late 70s is astounding.  Supergrass deliver great track after great track almost through the entire album, each one filled with a youthful energy and an appropriate goofiness that is so lacking in the world of music.  The frontman of the band, Gaz Coombs, has written enough infectious songs on this one effort alone to qualify him as one of the great pop writers of all time.  Only during maybe one or two tracks does the album slow a bit.  It effects the final result of the album but it doesn't kill it (the slow tracks are just as good as the rest).  It's amazing to think how short-lived Supergrass' fame was when listening to this fine album and one can only hope that these unsung artists will rise to the top once more+music
THIS IS NOT THE RYODISC RADIO ONE LIVE SESSIONS+N+these are pre-canned radio shows with the ever unbearable alexis korner talking on top of the songs as wow cool groovy DJ "intro". the old Radio One was a real live in studio show that was GREAT. THese are mostly studio released cuts from the first and second album mixed with DJ chatter and one HEndrix interview with a phoney, well let's hear that song now shall we intro to the recorded album version!  As one who has been seriously burned by repackaged Hendrix stuff in the past, and as a loong time fan (I remember when he lived and died) it takes alot for me NOT to recommend all things Hendrix, but I cannot recommend this. Find the actual LIVE RAdio One recording, not these packaged cut and pasted radio shows +music
I couldn't be happier!+P+The product was exaclty what I asked for.  Chock full of Queen hits that should satisfy any queen fan+music
... and 1/2 ....strong rhythmic intensity, catchy lyrics & just plain ol' fun rowdiness+P+Playing Time - 38:26 -- If you know what's best for you on a Saturday night, then you'll pick up a copy of "Horseshoes & Hand Grenades," for a driving set of  Summar's rockin' country music. Actually, he calls it "farm rock," a convergence of Chuck Berry and George Jones. Full of grit, Trent incorporates strong rhythmic intensity as the foundation for his striking stories and just plain ol' fun rowdiness. The elements all lend  perfectly to our listening amusement. They hit the ground with a steady gallop from the first song to the last, even with the brief eccentric punk/grunge moments in "He Stopped Loving Her Today" that will either get you frowning or smiling depending on how open-minded you are to the boys having a little fun with the country classic.   I haven't heard the album that Trent put out in 2000 (or his 1994 "Hank Flamingo" release), but understand that it brought plenty of airplay, gig and tour offers...even landed him a showcase on the Grand Ole Opry. Produced by Rand Bishop, "Horseshoes & Hand Grenades" further indulges us with some eclectic alt-country instrumentalists and background vocalists. Remember the Ozark Mountain Daredevils with their blend of country rock, bluegrass, and southern boogie? Bassman/vocalist Michael "Supe" Granda was a founding member of that group. And the 1980s Atlanta-based Georgia Satellites with their Stones-like guitar grunge? Guitarist/vocalist Dan Baird was a key member of that enjoyable band. Steel guitarist Gary Morse is a regular with Brooks & Dunn. Other experienced musicians in The New Row Mob include Dave Kennedy (drums), Ken McMahan (guitar), and a host of others who appear to a lesser degree on the CD. Mike Webb's piano and B-3 organ are noteworthy.  Besides those collaborations with other Nashville-based writers, a number of the musicians on the album co-wrote many of these songs with Summar. And you may have already heard some of the songs covered by others like Billy Currington ("She Knows What to Do With a Saturday Night"), Gary Allan ("Guys Like Me"), and Jack Ingram ("Love You"). That's a feather is Summar's cap for other up-and-coming singers to acknowledge the sturdiness of Trent's material. Without being too disparaging, I found the similarity of the beat in a few of the songs to create a modicum of banality. But, for the most part, the set progresses as a successful, raucous journey from beginning to end. Reminiscent of the Bakersfield sound, the country rock-infused groove and clever lines convey some deliriously fun messages. Some other catchy hooks, and even some rustic bluegrass flavorings, are found in songs like "Hayride," "Pink John Deere," and "Girl From Tennessee." Hitting you like an express train, "Louisiana Nashville Line" is full of steam. In "Guys Like Me," Trent sings "It's hard to find a place to play my guitar, they're trying to put an end to guys like me." I'd say this album will fetch him plenty of fame and gigs. Trent's well on his way to landing his golden dreams on solid ground. (Joe Ross, Roseburg, OR.)+music
Five Stars does not do this art justice.+P+From where Metheny and his group members, (of a common soul, I'd almost swear, playing different tools from the same heart with different fingers) take me and took European audiences on this album, I would have titled it "Levitation."  Music, well composed and performed, built and played with care, love, creativity and talent, takes me places that approach ecstatic.  With this work on the audiograph I am transported places VERY few other musicians have ever taken me close to, in any genre.  I can only compare it to feeling lifted up and floating, being held aloft--levitated-- by Pat's group, working together so tightly while flowing, like liquid, over and through the songs' melodies, arrangements, rhythms.  Listening, right now, to this CD's version of the Metheny-Mays standard "First Circle." Am in the clouds!  Think it's just my opinion? Listen to the crowd!   Damn! Those big, blocky Mays chords.  Buy the album. Put it in a car's player. Turn it up!!!   You will thank me. You will thank those 6 guys. You won't want to get where you're going.  Le+music
stirring and hauntingly beautiful+P+Those of you who aren't familiar with Ofra Haza, I encourage you to please listen to this beautiful woman's albums.  "Kirya" is definitely a wonderful example of the legacy Haza left, when she passed away in 2000.  Although some call her the "Madonna of the Middle East," in my opinion I think she is far more talented, prolific and outstanding.  For starters, Ofra Haza was devoutly religious, as a Yemenite Jew, from Israel, had a clean sound, put ancient poetry to music, and used her voice as an instrument for peace and liberation.  That is where she and Madonna vear off quite differently from one another.    "Kirya" presents a beautiful cross-section of songs and experiences.  We hear her sing in English, Arameic and Hebrew.  The songs are about sadness, mortality and love.  Some great, outstanding examples on this album include:  "Trains of No Return"  (about the effects of the Holocaust and the trains heading to Auschwitz and Dachau, amongst many other concentration camps, where Jews were systematically executed), "Daw da Hiya,"  (about the consequences of a young woman's premarital affair with her lover), and "Don't Forsake Me" (about old age).    This is a treasure of an album.  Buy it today.....Let the legacy of Ofra Haza remain for many, many years to come. What an inspirational and beautiful woman......+music
Comin' With a 2.5!+N+Keith Sweat's 1991 release didn't come off as the usual or other releases of his.  For starters, Keith is mostly known for his bumping slow jams and he didn't let us down with the ones on here.  As a matter of fact, that was the only thing that kept this one from being a total disaster.  Once getting to track 6 with "I Want To Love You Down" the lp quickly prepares you for the whining and begging that makes him so popular.  It couldn't have got any better with "Give Me What I Want" featuring Silk on background and taking the song to the next level of sexiness.  Silk and Mr. Sweat invites you with "The Ten Commandments Of Love" with the background vocals saying, "...come on, come on, come on, come on baby...".  Maybe this release would have been better if it was an entire Keith Sweat & Silk release+music
More than solid sophomore album+P+One of the most ecxiting new bands to come out of Cincinnati in recent years is the Heartless [...] (urrgh, what a TERRIBLE band name), a power trio led by singer-songwriter-guitarist Erila Wennerstrom. 18 months after the release of their very promising debut album "Stairs and Elevators" now comes the second album.  "ALl This Time" (10 tracks, 40 min.) finds a more polished, but still very hard rocking, sound. The album's first track "Into the Open" starts off with a piano even. Wennerstrom continues to provide layers of guitar riffs, and the rest of the band contributes to the "wall of sound". Guitar solos are far and few between (only on the title track and on the closer "Comes a Long Way"). The album really takes flight on the second half, with highlight after highlight: "Blue Day" and "No Pointing Arrows" are the proof that this band has "it". In all, a very satisfying album that zooms by in no time, and you'll want to play it again.  I've seen the band live a couple of times in the last 10 days, giving shows around town in preparation for a long nation-wide tour to support "All This Time". Frankly, the band is even better live than in the studio, and they are not to be missed if you have chance to see them. Highly recommended+music
Awesome...it doesn't get much better than this+P+Live and incredible sound of Bill Champlin's voice with veteran musicians just sizzling along. This is a CD not to miss. Wow. Why don't we have more music like this today+music
Breathe deep - this "smoke" is good for the soul+P+Lucky Thompson was a strange one - a fighter, a questioner, a perfectionist, a complainer, a self-proclaimed victim of musical exploitation by what he called "vultures" - who dropped from the scene sometime in the mid-late 70s, gave his horns away to pay off debts, and never had anything to do with music again. He died a homeless recluse in Seattle in July 2005. Oh yeah, he was also one of the greatest tenor saxophonists ever to play jazz.  This 1964 quartet date finds Lucky in the company of a very supportive rhythm section. The lyrical and fleet Hank Jones on piano is a handsome foil for the equally fleet and lyrical Thompson. On half the tunes Lucky plays soprano; MID-NITE OIL and PREY LOOT, both Lucky compositions, are good soprano tracks. Lucky's writing has always been attractive. On tenor, FLY WITH THE WIND and REMINISCENT, again tunes written by Thompson, are the highlights. Connie Kay's drumming, so light and tasty, is a treat throughout the proceedings. This album is definitely worth checking out+music
This music will make you fall in love with New York+P+I have listened to this soundtrack hundreds of times since the movie came out and it brings back floods of memories of when I lived in New York City. A wonderful score,wonderful arrangements. S'wonderfull all the way  around..+music

The Best Live Album Ever Made...+P+Between 1971 and 1976, Roxy Music were in their "hip" phase and they were one of the best live acts ever, and still are today (can't wait for their new album!) I was not around for their 70s touring (*or for that matter, their Manifesto-Avalon tours, I was born in 1991). Here is what I say about Roxy Music:  MOVE OVER PINK FLOYD! OUT OF MY WAY LED ZEPPELIN! THE WHO, THIS ISN'T A PARKING LOT! Roxy Music were the best band in all of the world and will always  retain that position, with three frontmen: Bryan Ferry- The best singer in rock history and the best looking Andy Mackay- His saxophone playing will blow you away Phil Manzanera- His guitar playing is world-class And to top it all off, you have THE GREAT Paul Thompson, the most energetic drummer ever! His drumming is not one little bit out-of-time. And of course, there's the magnificent Brian Eno + Eddie Jobson who were the group's synthesiser players from 1971-73 and 1973-76 respectively. Jobson also played violin, which just added another coolness point. These guys ARE THE ONLY BAND THAT MATTERS! AND THEY DIDN'T SELL OUT BUT STILL KNEW WHAT TOP OF THE POPS WAS! Only drawback to the album: Not enough songs! NO THREE + NINE! NO MOTHER OF PEARL! AND NO LOVE IS THE DRUG! Otherwise, I give this 6 STARS  PS To everyone who says the Clash were the only band that mattered, you guys suck+music
Still writing great music+P+Upon first listening to 'Fundamental' I wasn't too impressed.  Nothing really grabbed me.  It all sounded like typical Pet Shop Boys.  But as I listened more, the songs began to take a life all their own.  'the sodom and gomorrah show' and 'numb' were the two that stuck out.  'sodom and gomorrah show', with it's driving beat and catchy melody and 'numb' and it's emotional plea to 'feel nothing' were both examples of fantastic harmony between lyric and melody.  the group has survived for more than 20 years in an era that no longer embraces their brand of pop without compromising their message or their sound.  I'm grateful to have had privilege of going to one of their shows recently.  Mainly because they're still touring, but also because they retain every bit of what made them famous in the 80s with a little song called 'west end girls'+music
The Most Romantic Melodies of All Time...+N+...become the most irritating elevator pablum ever concieved. Perfect for Stepfords everywhere! Not music, but a powerful central nervous system depressant that may cause permanent organic brain damage! Not Music! Avoid+music
well...+P+I would just like to take this opportunity to point out that the previous reviewer is mistakenly talking about From Her to Eternity, Cave's first album.  The Firstborn is Dead is quite good, though, even if nothing else  on it quite matches the greatness of Tupelo+music
Pleeze, Pleeze, Pleeze+N+I don't know what happened but this album needs to be slept on. This dude keeps rappin' about where he's from and junk like that. It's like he doesn't have anything else to say. While the production may be okay (it's questionable)the lyrics just plain suck. Hey Fiend give Dr. Dre a call+music
His BEST+P+This has to be his best CD. Not to long, not too short, unbelieveably funny! The comedian is live, uncensored, at his raunchy best. We miss you, Sam. RIP+music
UB40 at their best+P+I first bought this album in the early 80s and I played it to death.  I've been very dissappointed with later UB40 albums.    To my mind this album is how UB40 should sound. I still experience a thrill every time I hear the beginning to "Present arms".  "Sardonicus" just cooks, great intro and just it bubbles alongs.  At a matter of fact, all the songs (with the exception of Love Is All Is Alright & Don't Slow Down , which is are bit limp) on this album are very good.  If you like trippy sounding ska with a slight dub flavour, I'm confident that you will like this album+music
Strictly Old School+P+There are approximately four songs, that were released during my high school years. " Love On A Two-Way Street", is the song that triggers the memories, of a time in my life, when songs of love, especially young love, meant something! Raymond Oakley-St. Louis, Mo.  +music
Misinterpretations!+N+I was shocked to see that Maurice White had a hand in this misinterpretations of Earth Wind and Fire's classic songs. This CD was to launch or re-launch the Stax label. Its too bad the label did not launch with more orginal artists and compositions. While you may like the arrangements of the Elements' compositions, I could not get through this effort. The originals suit me just fine. +music
Oh for god sake+N+While I am a Blur fan I just cannot listen to this drivel. It's picked up this cult status among Blur fans as it's the heart-rendering story of Damon Albarn's break up with then girlfriend and lead singer of Wire rip-offs Elastica, Justine Frischmann. 13 is a document of that break up and my god it's useless self indulgence. Mindless even.  First we'll start off with the singles.   Tender - a plodding gospel song that goes nowhere and proves that Damon just can't hack it when it comes to soul no matter how much he protests. Long winded and uninteresting  Coffee & TV - While I marvel at the video, I do think that that takes away from the fact that this song is very ordinary and nothing at all special. It does feature one of Graham Coxon's more agreeable vocals and goes by fine enough.  No Distance Left To Run - Awful. Just plain awful. It never deserved to be a single. It should never have been a single. The lyrics are the most embarrassing I have ever listened to and Damon's voice is just off beyond all point. Although I'm sure those who love this album will point out that it's supposed to represent the pain he's going through. It just doesn't work.  As for the rest of the album it just a horrible mess of styles thrown together to make it sound like they've been listening to the coolest albums around and that America's underground is really cool which is ironic given that this band originally wanted to go against all that.  People say that Blur is Graham's album and this is 13's album and while I'm not so sure I'd label Blur Graham's album I can definitely agree with 13 being Damon's album. It's completely self-absorbed and the music is secondary to the theme of the album which in my book is never a good thing.  However there are a couple of good songs. BLUREMI and 1992 are toetappers and the often underrated Optigan 1. Poor Optigan 1. The Optigan is one of the more fascinating instruments and has a gently surreal yet antique way of sound. It's a credit that this was made. Yet it goes almost unnoticed by many because " Oh it's just an instrumental." A shame that, because it sounds like everything this album is trying to be; emotional, warm, hurt.   But most of the tracks here are surrounded in half thought-out ideas, lazily produced songs and in the case of Trimm Trabb, nicking the opening riff of Wined and Dined by Syd Barrett. I once said that this album was a poor man's Bad Moon Rising ( by Sonic Youth ) and by god I stick to that statement. While that album had oozing soundscapes, inventive lyrics and a sense of adventure even in dealing with some similar viewpoints ( although not all )......this feels completely lazy, lyrics depressed 15 year olds would laugh at, music that doesn't really do much and not a lot much else. It's painful to say that this is the same band who an album beforehand made something that was a stroke of genius. This however is not the answer though.  Buy this if you are in love with Damon's ego. Otherwise, do yourself a favour and buy other Blur albums ( other than The Great Escape and Leisure ) or better yet buy Sonic Youth's Bad Moon Rising. Beats the hell out of this cra+music
On my top 10+P+This is one of my favorite records. By FAR the best Blur record if you're trying to decide which one to get+music
Not an easy listen+N+I have found that there are two types of R &amp; H works. There are the lively and upbeat scores, like Cinderella and Sound of Music. Then there are the slower and denser scores, like Carousel and the King and I, which are not bad, but not to my liking. There are not many songs on here that appeal to the popular tastes. Music theorists will probably love it. I have found that the best R and H works are the ones that sound like they were written today, most notably Sound of Music+music
Sepultura's worst attempt.+N+This has to be one of the worst albums I have ever heard.  I got this album for my birthday as I was and still am a keen listener of metal and heavy metal music.  I have albums of Metallica,Queens of the Stone Age, Faith No More, Nine Inch Nails, Marilyn Manson, Slayer, Korn, Slipknot and Disturbed that I like, but Sepultura's Against is a joke.  The first track seems promissing with some cool guitar riffs and a solid heavy rythm.  Afterwards, it just goes downhill.  Every song seemed to mimic the next, with its repetative guitar solos and awful vocals from Derrick 'The D!*$' Green.  Sepultura were a much better band with Max Cavalera and now the lead singer sounds like he has no teeth. All of my friends (who are metal heads) agree with me 100% that this is Sepultura's WORST album.  Totally dreadful.  After 10 minutes of flicking through each song, I had to stop it, take it out and throw it out the window.  My advice: AVOID+music
Not even for Gertrude Lawrence fans!+N+This CD is shamefully misleading! It only features snipets of the original score and two members of the original cast. In fact, there is more dialogue than music on this CD! Worse, it sound like somebody dug up a set of '78s they found buried at the bottom of their gandfather's trunk and decided to record them on CD, scratches, pops, and all! I am a huge fan of Gertie Lawrence, but even I didn't have the nerve to play this CD more than once! Pick up The Royal National Theatre's production instead+music
Love Willie, hate this+N+The producer of this record does not kow reggae. Buy Willie's other records, but skip this. Buy any Marley record instead. The stiff, uneasy rhythm section on this album wouldn't have made it as fifth stand-in for any proper reggae artist+music
too many re-recordings for my taste+N+That's right, this is a collection of mostly the 60's countrypolitan stereo remakes of the 1950's classics with a sprinkling of originals from the 1960's but the re-recordings are definitely enough to let you all know that this CD is not recommended and that I recommend the Legacy &quot;Look What Thoughts Will Do&quot; 2 CD set with only the originals.  It may be a little higher priced but it delivers what it promises, the originals.  The disc is rated 1 star for the heavy amount of re-recordings (many awful performances) and another star for the sprinkling of originals+music
This is the G $h%t+P+Ya'll need dis CD.  This fool str8 flows.  RIP lil homey Trubl loc E+music
not so bad at all+P+Hypnotic, dreamy but not as laid back as the 12th installment... but the series is more mature these days on applying more on the acoustic side rather than the electronic effect+music
fairly average+N+I will Always give Shelia E.madd props for Her Musical Talent but this Album doesn't do it for me all the way.soft vibe&missing some snap.there are hints of Funk here&there but overall nothing really cooks to me.She does Her Best Work overall for Others&Live to me.but this is another mild Album which hardly to me showcases Her full Musicial depth+music
Flawed gem.+P+This album is a bit of an enigma to me, the material stands up, really well, but there's definitely weaknesses throughout it as well.  Let's start with the good-- certainly, the songs are brilliant-- "Love and Mercy" and "Melt Away", both really great sentimental pieces (the latter in particular is a personal favorite), "There's So Many" and "Let It Shine" both feature great vocal arrangements, and "Rio Grande" is just magnficiant.   And certainly many of the others ("Walkin' the Line",  "Meet Me In My Dreams Tonight") are more than good enough.  But there are some flaws-- Brian's voice sounds odd to me, I can't place it, almost forced, and his falsetto is definitely limited, probably most obvious on "One For the Boys" and "There's So Many".  Beyond this though, the biggest problem with the album is the '80s production, too many synthesizers, some of the songs would (and did in recent live performances) benefit from more acoutic arrangements.  Overall however, the album is rewarding, and you sort of get used to its odd sound.  The bonus tracks on the reissue are so-so, my favorite is actually the track titled "Brian on 'Love and Mercy'", which also features a snippet of a piano-and-vocal demo of the song.  The b-sides are kind of blah, but the demos are all really interesting+music
Teenager was brilliant+N+Just because you start doing Neil Young inspired music doesn't make it mature or creative.  I too miss Speedy Marie.  Maybe I'm just old+music
Worthy sequel to their 1977 classic+P+Although I prefer the original Ocean from 1977, this 1998 sequel isn't bad at all. Of course if you're a fan of the original Ocean like I am, don't expect it to sound like a clone of the original, you might be disappointed. I had my suspicions when I bought this disc, as I'm sure many others had, after all, there are so many prog bands out there that rightfully remained silent in the 1980s, only to reunite in the 1990s and give us some truly embarassing, pale, or uninspired stuff in an attempt to recapture their past glory. I'm glad Eloy didn't fall in to that trap. The production and sound of Ocean 2 is modern, digitally recorded. Definately not recommended to those prog rock fans who are anti-modern and like everything analog. But even so, the biggest surprise is the use of analog synths here! I hear my share Minimoog, some string synths, and even a little clavinet. Digital synths are also used, but hardly ever detracts from the music. By this time, Eloy was back to being a full band, thanks to Frank Bornemann, old-time member Klaus-Peter Matziol, Bornemann's late '80s/early '90s partner Michael Gerlach, and ex-Michael Schenker Group drummer Bodo Schopf. The reason I took a star off was I thought the end part of the CD dragged on a little (particularly &quot;The Answer&quot;), but eventually that no longer bothered me. Apparently, Eloy's previous label, SPV, rejected Ocean 2, so they moved on to a totally unlikely label: GUN (Great Unlimited Noise) whose specialty seems to be speed/thrash/death metal, so having a prog band on that label is truly strange company. So never mind the label Eloy was recording for this disc, if you're a prog rock fan, and you don't mind a more modern twist in your music, and you like vintage synths, you're sure to love this one+music
About Time!!+P+Love .45 has been working so hard for over 10 years and finally the fruits of their labor is coming to bear. Their sound has remained very consistant over the years with every release getting better and better. Now, these 12 songs, are so representative of the energy, enthusiasm and great heart, it's hard not to rank them among the elite. This CD will prove once and for all, that all those years of struggle were worth every minute. Don't miss out on getting in on the ground floor with this band. They will be successful for years to come!+music
Junk+N+"My Chain" is the worst song I have heard in a few years ... Go get Nas "Hip Hop Is Dead" instead of this garbage.+music
What the...?+N+This deal was the biggest rip off!  What DID indeed happen to the extra videos promised on the back?  Victory, just keep reaping that bad press..+music
Classics Revisited and Given New Life (4.5 stars)+P+This album, technically, is not new. Having been recorded over five years ago and released only in Japan, Scaggs chooses to revisit a number of his classic tunes -an unplugged "Lowdown," "Sierra," "Harbor Lights" and an glorious " We're All Alone"among others- and record them again under a moodier, at times even bluesier, light. Think of some place between "But Beautiful" and a more acoustic "Desire," if you are comparing albums. The core band, as well as the string arrangements, are tuned in to Scaggs' intent and contribute a great backdrop for his voice, which sounds quite great throughout these versions, the best example being the new take on "Simone." So, this is not quite a new album, we know the songs and it comes out after a long and inexplicable domestic delay, but the music contained here is pure Boz, sometimes at his best+music
The best Final Fantasy music for one of the best games ever.+P+I very rarely buy a soundtrack, especially to a videogame, however this one left me with no choice but to do so.  This easily the best videogame music I have ever listened to.  I guess one reason behind me buying this is the fact that unlike many PSX games, this one you can not listen to as a backwards compatible CD (All the final fantasies are this way) and the poor music CD that came with Anthologies left me wanting more.  No this is well worht purchasing even if you don't like the game, the music is more than enough to make this worth owning+music
Short and sweet+P+Excellent selection of some of the best from these three friends (and a little Zach Gill, too!). Gives you the feeling you're sneaking into a weekend jam session at Jack's house. Fans of these guys will want to add this CD to their library. Seems to me, though, they could have easily added a few more songs and make this a full length effort+music
Dio Is the voice of Black Sabbath+P+A powerful but overlooked Black Sabbath album with the definitive vocals of Ronnie James Dio. A mercilessly heavy song selection boasting excellent production, something "Mob Rules" can't say, strong songwriting and some of the best musicians on the planet. From this springboard you can see where Dio went with the release of his next solo albums. "Dehumanizer" will stand the test of time as one of the three best Sabbath albums ever alongside "Mob Rules" and "Heaven and Hell.+music
Milestone for an Exceptional but Too-Often Overlooked Artist+P+Chely Wright is that rare artist whose voice conveys more than just melody, there's raw emotion behind the words, and a range of emotion that runs the entire gamut from ecstasy to mournful sorrow.  That she earned her first number one single with the title track from this album was both blessing and curse. "Single White Female" was pure country pop, upbeat and quirky, a unique initial offering on an album that grows progressively more complex and introspective with each subsequent song. That MCA followed "Single White Female" by releasing the lyrically strong but folksy, down-tempo "She Went Out for Cigarettes" is almost inexplicable; the two songs are such polar-opposites that their back-to-back pairing on the album is somewhat jarring. There are so many solid songs on this album that it's hard to say what could have happened had the follow-up been one of her more high-energy tracks or one of her more soul-searching ballads.  Thematically, Single White Female is an album about every facet of love, from the awkward beginning stages to the tearful end. The album's true center comes not from the title track, but from the third single released, "It Was".   For those attracted to the album by the title track, "The Fire" comes closest to matching its energy and tone, followed by the radio-friendly "Some Kind of Somethin'". Together with "Single White Female", this trio of peppy songs anchor and invigorate an overall somber ten-track album.  Perhaps the strongest track on the album is the fourth, "Unknown", a slow ballad with a wailing steel guitar accompaniment whose lyrics touch the great fears so many of us share of ending our days alone; Chely's smoky voice has never conveyed more collective pathos. There's also an updated version of her 1996 single, "The Love that We Lost"--which, vocally, is so much stronger than the radio release from her second album that the two songs sound vastly different despite nearly identical musical arrangements. Then there's "Picket Fences", a song laced with tangible irony, regret, and even denial--a trifecta that paint a vivid but sad story of a career-driven persona.   The album ends with the cute but bittersweet "Rubbin' it In", a song about all those little haunting reminders that come after a relationship ends, and the desperate pining of "Why Do I Still Want You".  Both lyrically and vocally, this is an album that strives to make a connection with the listener. For those so attuned, Single White Female is a too-often overlooked emotional journey that's solid and rewarding, a milestone record in a career that deserves so much more attention from an artist who has never gotten the attention she truly deserves.  Closing in on a decade since the album's release, the sound and the soul are still as fresh today as they were when Single White Female first hit store shelves, longevity that's rare in an age of throw-away music from a seemingly endless parade of different but identical pre-fab singers+music
Everything's Kool!+P+What a set! One disc of hardcore funk, and one disc of great 80s pop. Kool and the Gang's transformation is just as radical as Fleetwood Mac's was when Lindsey and Stevie joined, or when Talking Heads went from new wave to funk. Disc one brought back a lot of memories for me; songs I had completely forgotten about, "Funky Stuff", "Hollywood Swingin'", "Higher Plane", "Summer Madness", and "Love and Understanding".  Allegedly the early stuff kept James Brown awake at night; the Gang was THAT funky. Proof's on disc one. The songs are mostly instrumental with a smattering of call/response. Their M.O. is simple, establish the groove and WORK IT. And then James JT Taylor joined in 1979 and, thus disc two. The Gang is now a hit machine, cranking out the music like Ford turned out Thunderbirds: "Ladies Night", "Too Hot", "Celebration" (which will live long after you and I are gone), and on and on and on. Even in this phase they still etablish the groove and work it, as displayed on the almost 7 minute "Let's Go Dancing"... even that's too short! Whoever put this together at Universal deserves a raise or something. The songs are chronological, well written band essay, ample credits. This two disc best of should be the standard to which other record companies strive. Get yours today+music
smooth and smoking+P+Buddy Guy is THE definiition of the blues. This album is a collection of the Chess recording years and is one of those albums i can put on and let run straight through.  The first song on the album &quot;Worried Mind&quot; is a great lesson in &quot;less is more&quot; guitar soloing. &quot;I found a true love is buttery smooth and &quot;leave my little girl alone&quot; is a blues classic.  If your not convinced that this is a great album just remember that Stevie Ray Vaughn and Eric Clapton considered Buddy one of their biggest influences+music
Love it+P+I love this CD - whenever I want to relax, meditate, or even get work done and hopefully avoid stress, I put this CD on and it is just soothing!+music
For diehards only.+N+Let me start by putting out a couple of my biases before getting into this review-- first, I relaly don't care for remixes as a rule, unless they're dramatic and severely restructure a song, I generally find they add little. Second, I really don't care for "The Hand That Feeds".  Having said that, the piece is presented in three mixes, the album version, the Straight mix, and the Dub mix. The album version has a catchy, circular guitar line and a straightahead drum beat that's actually decent until the bridge with this bizarrely irritating spoken wordish section. Just doesn't work.  The remix fares no better-- the Straight mix adds different rock beats and an extended introduction that eventually becomes tedious.  If you're a fan, get it. If not, skip this one, there's good reasons it wasn't released in the U.S+music
wired rules!+P+This is my fav for guitar instrumentals.What I love about beck is that he is about tone and not about speed.most people think the faster your solos are the better,not true at all.beck has amazing melody and tone and is very technical and his leads and solos are amazing.a great album by my favorite guitarist.    Beck is very underated.he can play as good as any of the greats.he buries clapton,page.i would say hendrix and beck are the 2 best guitar players.both have great tone and similar styles+music
Cruel Brittania+N+Britain, circa 1997.  Tony Blair is elected P.M.  Princess Di perishes.  And the Spice Girls are unleashed to an unsuspecting public.  This effort is an attempt to cash in on the phenomenon before a fickle populace turns their attention to the next best thing.  To be fair, the girls are not to blame for what a tedious flick this is.  Rather, they are appealing and prove to be the film's lone redeeming factor.  The fault lies in the script that tries to do for the Spice Girls what "A Hard Days' Night" did for the Beatles.  Whereas the Fab Four's film was full of wit and cogent commentary on Beatlemania this flick is unfunny and basically incoherent about what it's trying to say about the Spice craze.  I was reminded more of the Monkees' "Head" than I was of "A Hard Days' Night".  Lots of celeb cameos (Roger Moore, Elton John, et al) that amount to naught.  Oh, well.  On to "From Justin to Kelly"+music
Lunar Powered+P+I'm only familiar w/ the soundtrack from the movie video so far but plan to get the CD. The soundtrack, especially the melodic, casual and deliberate &quot;Bright Moon,&quot; combined with the camera-work and choreography really did it for me. I got used to the higher pitch that the singer used almost immediately. This would make a great CD for the highway+music
Not at all what I expected+N+Junque music.  Sorry I bought it.  There are two songs off of the Raising Arizona tracks that I do like, however... I'm really not happy with this one at all.  Maybe I can go up to a pawn shop and trade it for something listenable.  Sorry Carter+music
The heavens are telling+P+This is a very great chorus, and one of Haydn's best as far as i am concerned. The pace, grandness and spirit of the piece all conjure in one's imagination the majesty of heaven, and God's throne. I cannot help but be moved to praise the God of the heavens and the earth.  kanmi ogundip+music
This is a Ten-Star Album+P+If you have ever been in love, if you love listening to great music, if you want to linger a bit in the past with wonderful love songs and unsurpassed artists, THEN BUY THIS ALBUM.  How can you possibly lose?  The artful direction of Nelson Riddle, combined with ageless, moving love songs sung superbly by Linda Ronstadt - ladies and gentlemen - it doesn't get any better than this!  In fact, if you want a collection of absolutely beautiful love songs, get all three albums by Ronstadt and Riddle:  What's New; Lush Life; and For Sentimental Reasons.  There is life after LP albums - thank heavens for remastered CD's.  Great music forever saved.  BUY THIS ALBUM NOW+music
Outstanding!!!  A Great Album From Start to Finish+P+If you are tired of the cookie cutter, assembly line garbage that passes  for country music these days, then pick up this CD for a refreshing change.   if you are looking for a singer who makes you sit up and pay attention to  the lyrics, then this album is a must have.  The songs run the gamut  emotionally.  From tear jerkers such as Blue Wing and Veteran's Day, to  foot stomping tunes like Gallo del Cielo this album covers all the bases+music
Concepts get better with practice+N+I love this show!  That said, I do not care for this version of it.  The inclusion of the word "concept" in the title means it is just that.  This was, thankfully, not the final version of the show that would later spawn the hit song, "One Night In Bangkok".  With most Broadway musicals, the musical numbers tell the basic story of the show.  If you listen to the recordings of Phantom, Mama Mia, Beauty and the Beast, you can discern the basic storyline of the show.  Listening to this particular recording of Chess, though, will leave you wondering "What was that?"  The Broadway arrival of Chess saw a much needed reworking of the storyline and arrangement of the musical numbers.  This recording seems too much like a mish-mash of songs that don't really relate to each other.  For musical fanatics (like myself), I say "yes, you should have this recording in your collection", if only to understand how much work went into the show before it opened on Broadway.  If you are only buying the album because of "One Night In Bangkok", purchase the Broadway recording instead; you'll be much happier with the performance by Phillip Casnoff rather than Murray Head+music
only 25 mins or so of music!+N+there are only 8 songs, mildy mediocre ones at best, the total run time is around 25 minutes...on that basis alone it is not worth the 6 bucks+music
great idea, masterfully pulled off+P+Avantasia, the metal opera - where to begin? a slew of famous power metal vocalists, top-notch instrumentation, and exciting fantasy-inspired lyrics combine to give us the first half of a two-part story created by Edguy frontman Tobias Sammet.  note: it is an opera in the sense that each role is performed by a different vocalist.  best tracks are Avantasia, Sign of the Cross, Glory of Rome, The Tower, and Serpents in Paradise.  the instrumental tracks are well-done and don't hurt the story. Malleus Maleficarum is creepy but adds to the story. Inside is the one track you can skip - luckily, it's only two minutes long+music
Excellant combination  of songs.+P+Best of Wayne Newton Now is an excellant compilation of music.  The oldies are there, a few I had never heard, but I am so glad I did.  It goes from toe-tapping music to daydreaming and just plain crying songs.  Since I am a  long time fan and have just recently attended his Christmas show, I can  assure you, this CD will not be a dissapointment+music
not very good+N+The problem with this cd is that it is not all that good.  Other than that, it is fine+music
More Trio Kurt!+P+What a record! This is my favorite recording and context for his playing (and I have heard all he's recorded for the public). So very very good: I just got it yesterday and I can't take it off. The title cut (which [is it just me?] rings of Goodbye Pork Pie Hat), is alone worth whatever price you have to pay. Hats off to Jorge Rossy too (as always).  Seriously, I hope he explores the trio setting again and again in what is sure to be a long career. It is so rare these days to hear a voice like this, where you know instantly that you're hearing a guy in for the long haul! Beautiful+music
Two great songs on this rare CD+N+"Point of No Return" is fantastic, "I Can't Wait" a little less so. Whatever happened to this band?   The two tracks above are worth the modest purchase price+music
70's inverted+P+Another good effort, I like this one better than the last. Band is tight and the production is great. Jeff's Jesus song is awesome.  However, Jim's singing is poor. He's a fine producer, but come on -- he would get polite applause AT BEST at your local open mike. This isn't a 3rd grade pageant -- not everyone gets to sing, pal+music
Classic Szell+P+If you want to hear George Szell and the Cleveland Orchestra at the peak of their famed Mozartean sound, look no further than this disc. These works, both originally chamber pieces, are perfect showpieces for Szell's chamber-music style of Mozart playing. These recordings capture Szell and the orchestra at the prime of their partnership, combining the punchy, almost gutteral orchestral sound Szell favored with transparent delineation of details and almost scary rhythmic and tonal precision. There are other, equally valid styles of playing these works, but none that are better. Of course the German Dances, with Boskovsky and his ensemble at the helm, are well played and enjoyable too, but they're the icing on a very substantial cake. Don't miss the opportunity to pick up this budget-priced piece of definitive Mozart interpretation+music
A Major Let-Down! It was water-down metal!  Actually....it is S***T  Metal!!!!!+N+I purchased this album when it came out, I listened to it once and threw it in the garbage afterwards. It was that bad!!!   It didnt have any of the catchy riffs of the earlier misfits. And the drums!...the drums of the old misfits gave it a unique sound...and this one! It was second-rate heavy metal/thrash drumming. This album was a terrible,terrible disappointment. I could not believe I spent my money on this album. It is a lame,sad and pathetic attempt at resurrecting the glory of the old misfits.....this album and the ones after this, proves this to be true.+music
Thank You Jerry Only+N+You have destroyed everything the Misfits were about with this album. No wonder Glenn doesn't speak to you. Maybe he would be over your lack of musical ability if you hadn't trashed his creation. Jerry Only sold out the original fiends. This cd is a polished turd+music
Buy This Album For q.e.d. and land's end !!+P+Here is how I see it. I am a huge fan of One Of A Kind and Spice Of Life and other Bruford albums with YES. This recording has it's moments and these are memorable moments! It also has some weak points.  But I am going to focus on why you should run out and buy this now. There are two tracks on this cd that are must haves for Bruford fans. Here is what they are called...q.e.d  and land's end.  These two are killer!!  The suspense and tension, the release after a build up, the drumming, the incredible guitar and bass work with piano is so satisfying that I would be embarressed to tell you how many times I have listened to these masterpieces.  I urge you to listen to these fantastic songs over and over again!  They really are that good.  By the way I got to meet Bill Bruford in Oakland at Yoshi (a jazz venue) last year in the spring and he was so much fun to see with Earthworks.  Anyway if you have not heard One Of A Kind, buy it now because it is the best jazz album of all time!+music
All of my favorite Neil songs on here+P+I recall this period of Neil Diamond's hits between about 1978 and 1982. I still like Yesterday's Songs and that smooth groove. I love September Morn and its relaxing pace--sounds like you could hear it on a quiet breezy day with the windows open. America means so much now in its patriotic theme.  I still love Love On The Rocks--unlike anything I heard on the radio back in 1980--it's so adventurous when I hear it. I like the rock stomp on Forever In Blue Jeans.  But let's cut the chase to his classic duet with Barbra Streisand in You Don't Bring Me Flowers. At times, it's humorous, playful, romantic and emotional.   It probably led to a huge duets boom in music in the late '70s as a lot of artists did duets. These days, the term most used is collaborations for these kinds of duets. But it's a pretty song, one of Neil's best songs since his upbeat '60s pop.  Diamond's new album "12 Songs" has been selling well and it might get him back on top like he did with these songs on Volume 2. +music
Mr Durst, please tell the class, how does one spell ''BISCUIT?''+N+Limp Bizkit? Metal? The two go together like when Dante met Bosh in a crack alley in Bogota: A real big mess...  Being a true metal fan (a la, Slayer, Testament, Pissing Razors and Megadeth) I find Limp Bizkit's excuse for metal as nothing more than a pathetic joke. Metal never had rap in it's fold, and to even attempt to combine the two spectrums together would be disgracing the world of metal...and I'm sure rap fans would be equally angry.  Make up your mind, Durst (your stupidly miniscule mind). Are you a metaller? Or a rapper? Oh, and I suggest that Fred goes back to school so that he can pay attention in his English language lessons so that he might just learn how to spell properly. +music
Too sober -  not so joyous - not what I anticipated+N+I was not pleased with this CD - I wanted hymns rendered more joyously....+music
Containing The Monster+P+On R.E.M.'s previous two albums, Out Of Time & Automatic For The People, the band created quiet classics by employing a wide array of beautiful instruments including mandolins, harpsichords, strings and the like. They did a complete 180 on Monster, which is anything but quiet. The album is steeped in the glam-rock of the 70's and the grunge music of its day. Peter Buck threw away the acoustic stuff, plugged in and turned the volume up to 11. The band shows off their musical aptitude as this album sounds like nothing they've done before or since. "What's The Frequency, Kenneth?" opens the album awash in buzzing guitars and undesciprable Michael Stipe vocals. "Crush With Eyeliner" is a glam-rock classic and sounds like it could be out of the David Bowie songbook. "I Don't Sleep, I Dream" is a pulsating track while "Star 69" is straight ahead, tongue-in-cheek rocker. "Tongue" is probably the band's sexiest song done in a bump and grind style. "Let Me In" is their tribute to the late Kurt Cobain. "Bang And Blame" is the best song on the album, with its synthesized sound and popping guitars. Monster was the band's first album to debut at number one and with it, they continued to push the envelope and shake up their identity. This album really benefits from the 5.1 audio as the original album is full of buzzing guitars & distortion and the mix makes for a richer sound+music
Ack... eject!+N+You see the name Andrew Lloyd Webber and assume it can't be horrible right? WRONG! When I put this CD into my player I was horrified. Some of the music was ok, but most of it was awful and cheesy. The London cast putting on southern accents are really bad. The lead character Swallow, has a voice made for a high school production, but not a soundtrack like this. This is not typical ALW, Musical Theater, or good music. This is good milk gone sour. I do however like the voice of the character Amos (pronounced in this CD as AY-MOSS) which is why my favorite song is "Tire Tracks and Broken Hearts" I suggest this for collectors, and ALW fans, but don't expect the normal, this is a new rock-christian ALW.+music
Boring+N+This music is boring. All tangos have the same tempo. No milongas. What a shame! Trying to do routines to this music would be  a waste of time. This CD sounds like background music in a lounge.+music
But it for 'Frances the Mute'+P+Like Pete said, Frances the Mute is supposed to be the first song of the album by the same title.  I wondered whether getting a cd single would be worth it just for the one song (since I already had the Widow from FTM the album), and after hearing it, I don't think I could listen to the full album again without starting off with the FTM song.  It seems that critical to the album.  It starts off with about 4 and a half minutes of what sounds like metal clanging, like prison bars or something, then picks up with the main part of the song, simple but powerful.  When that ends after a few minutes, you get a few minutes of very slow, quiet beautifully depressing and haunting section and then builds for the grand finale to the song and drifts into the opening FTM the album where "the ocean floor is hidden from your viewing lens" picks up.  Trust me, for hardcore fans, this IS essential.  If anything, download. You need this+music
THE BEST .38 ALBUM EVER!!!+P+I'VE BEEN A FAN OF .38 SINCE THEIR FIRST ALBUM, AND THIS RANKS FROM FIRST TRACK TO LAST AS THEIR BEST EFFORT IN MY OPINION.  DON BARNES AND DONNIE VAN ZANT EACH LEND THEIR DISTINCTIVE VOICES TO SUCH ROCKERS AS 'CHAINED  LIGHTNING' AND 'BACK DOOR STRANGER'. THE GUITAR WORK OF BARNES AND JEFF  CARLISI WAS NEVER BETTER.  SOUTHERN ROCK AT IT'S FINEST!!+music
It's about time for Trent to retire to the producing world . . . +N+This album was an absolute disappointment.  I've never thought of a Nine Inch Nails album as fun, but the only redeeming quality for With Teeth is that some of the songs ("Only", "You Know Who You Are") are just fun.  The others fall somewhere in the realm of pretentious, irritating, or just plain bad.  Here are the main problems, as I see them:  1. Lyrics - this should come as no suprise, though, as Trent was never a poet.  Take love/sex, add addiction, frustration, inadequacy, failure, deviance, etc., and you have 80% of the Nine Inch Nails songs ever written.  Additionally, Trent cannot sing . . . or scream!!!  His range lies somewhere around mumble and whine.  This is easy to see past when the music is good, but not on this album.  2. Lack of Complexity - NIN has always been interesting, if not good, musically.  Trent laid on the synth layers thick, and it was possible to listen to an album (The Fragile) many times and keep noticing new things he was doing musically.  That doesn't happen here -- this is very one-dimensional and boring.  3. Not Innovative - NIN was good because he/they did things that no one had done before musically, and that in and of itself was exciting.  NIN never sounded like anything else, though there were a lot of knock-offs in his/their wake.  Either the technology is so accessible that everyone is doing what NIN used to be the only ones to do, or Trent Reznor got lazy, because this sounds like every other piece of electronic-rock crap to come out in the past decade (except with Trent Reznor's voice). +music
Sad signs of decline+P+As the title suggests, this is Ice-T's return. But the return to exactly what? It could be viewed as either the return to the forefront of hip-hop, or the return to his roots, end of the 80s style of hip-hop. While I'm sure Ice thought of the former, the resulting album doesn't quite achieve any of the two "Return to" targets.  There are two very notable changes in Ice-T style here. First is in the lyrics department. While Ice is as intelligent and witful as ever, he has toned down his verses a lot. Gone is the almost uncontrolled aggression of "Home Invasion". Instead we have mostly slow to mid-tempo tracks, most of which deal with the topics of either rap game and its rules, or warns against being a gangster. This change is quite understandable for a man about to turn 40 years old. The lyrics are mostly good and to the point. Though I must admit I still find the 2 love ballads here to be somewhat out of place.  The other notable change is in the music. It has advanced from basic beats and noises towards more rich soundscape. Most of the tracks, especially the slower ones, attempt to develop a feeling of uneasiness and tension, and most of the times it works.  So why do I think this album is one more step on the way down? Because taken as a whole, it lacks the focus and a sense of general direction that "O.G." maintained perfectly. Not a single time did I cringe, realizing that this or that track is just a filler ("Forced To Do Dirt", anyone?). Another turn off might be that old-school feeling of the whole attempt, which simply sounds out of tune with the general development of rap. Clearly Ice-T wanted to put himself back in the game. But as much as I respect his previous efforts, more often than not I vision a man in his late 30s who is generally unsure as to what kind of music really works in 1996, and his songs often sound strained and entirely forced out.  That being said, for long time fans, which I am one of, this is generally a nice little album, that is worth to be listened to occasionally. But it's far from being a mandatory purchase+music
Art rock genius...an essential. +P+When Roxy Music reunited in 2001, they dipped into the bulk of this album, unfortunately, Brian Eno didn't take part in the shows.   But in 1973, they recorded an album so far ahead of its time that it still sounds futuristic today. The sax, synths and screaming guitars along with Ferry's haunting vocals make for creepy afterhours listening.   Those who are only familiar with Roxy and Bryan from the 80s on are going to be shocked when they hear this. Those who love Ziggy-era as well as the Eno-Fripp and Eno-Bowie collaborations will love it.  Those who have watched Rocky Horror can picture Richard O'Brien listening to this relentlessly. You can hear Radiohead putting this one on as a point of reference for their more recent work (Thom Yorke does a fairly decent Ferry soundalike on the "Velvet Goldmine" soundtrack). You can hear Tangerine Dream, Can and Kraftwerk taking notes as well as goth pioneers like bauhaus and Joy Division cutting their teeth on this one, or Bowie and Peter Gabriel seeing how "the enemy" is doing. Another name that came to mind was director David Lynch, who would work with Eno on a "Dune" track. You can picture Bono and Edge discussing the songs...    There are accessible songs like "Do The Strand" and "Editions of You", and then you have "Bogus Man", "In Every Dream Home a Heartache" and "For Your Pleasure" which are as far out as you can get. +music
Incredible.  Buy it NOW!+P+I agree with other reviewers who wonder how anybody could give this less than 5 stars.  This album sticks with you over time as few can.  It is like listening to a psyche explode into madness, from the tight grip of "schizophrenia" to the noise that builds with "Kotton Krown" and continues through the chaos of "White Dick."  I recommend this as somewhat of a SY apostate.  I admit that I listen to Goo more than EVOL, and have defended Goo even in heated exchanges with random strangers in bars.  It seems that Daydream Nation is the watershed moment (read "sell out") for most "true" SY fans and I was surprised to see Sister and DN linked in so many of these Amazon reviews.  They are completely different, and if you though DN was experimental, maybe you should not go back any further in the SY catalogue.  Avoid Sister.  I also agree with reviewers who tout this as far superior to most "indie" or non-indie music for that matter.  There is an authenticity here, as with all SY, that one doesn't find anymore, an attitude about making music as art without regard for sales or singles or airplay (even on the "classic alternative" stations popping up in SoCal and soon to be exported to your suburb).  You listen to Sister and you understand how pervasive SY is in their influence, from the Pixies to Nirvana to the White Stripes, it don't exist without early SY.  Not to say that bands copy SY, it's just that their music, exemplified by this record, is infectious and so deeply layered in sound and attitude that, like VU before them, it would be hard not to show some influence.  If you are new to SY and want a great starter album, Sister is where to go, then buy EVOL and Daydream Nation, move toward the fine work from the early 90s (Goo, Dirty, Experimental Jet Set...) and on to Murray Street+music
great sound great performance+P+great sound great performance, pity there were no other hard to find  jems besides "start me up+music
Real jazz+P+Just great jazz, and it's enough to tell about that. Coltarne, Tyner, Garrison & Jones give you a piece of music you cannot forget. You love jazz, you love it.+music
Career suicide+N+Eight long years after this album was released and I figure I might as well write a review.  I know what people say, that, it wasn't the Downward Spiral 2.  Well, I was hoping for something equally as impressive as the Downward Spiral, not the same.  I realize bands move on, grow up, GET OLD, but, such a contrast.  The Downward Spiral, and previous works, were a progressive movement towards something.. something.  The Fragile may have been that something.  The world will never know.   I wonder...who will hold the chalice next?  Blame it on fear, blame it on drugs, blame it on pressure, blame it on whatever, but, this album is the ultimate opportunity lost.  Successive works, such as "With Teeth", are just flat out laughable.  Was Nine Inch Nails ever a great band?  I have my doubts...  yet, I can still remember being dumbstruck by the glory of Mr. Self Destruct that first time...  As far as I'm concerned, this album was Trent's fall from Godhood.  This album has no purpose, no progression.  It's a mess of half committed tracks and trivial ambience.  There is no plot, no experience.  While Downward Spiral was a journey to something divine, this album, however, lacks any magic whatsoever.  This album WILL NOT change you.  Oh, NiN will still be around, perhaps for ten more years, perhaps even twenty. But, that spirit, that anger, that POWER which is found in the Downward Spiral and Broken will never show itself again.  The sincerity is but a fading memory, and to those just discovering NiN, will never be felt.  All in all, I would rather have never been born than live in a post Fragile world.  It was that disapointing to me, and still is.  One star for destroying one of the only joys of my childhood+music
Lyrically and Truthfully BRUTAL !!!+P+Alice ... you are a smart Christian, you tell it how you see it and you see it correct, now all you have to do is stop hanging around with that bum Rob Zombie.  Anyways, onto the album ... its great, not so melodical and not as great as The Last Temptation but still awesome, its heavy, deep and the lyrics leave a lasting impression.  Also I would like to add how great his latest album Dirty Diamonds is, it varies in song styles with great production and catchy tunes geniously written.  Just remember, God is great and Alice is cooler than cool+music
Lester, "Pres" for the friends+P+Lester Young.What more can I say ? He was the most incredible jazz player of all times. The king of tenor saxophone.He recorded this session in 1956,three years before his death,with some outstanding companions : Teddy Wilson,Vic Dickenson,Roy Eldridge,Freddie Greene,Gene Ramey and Jo Jones.What a hall of fame!!Just listen to the magnificent version of "I'll guess I'll have to change my plan",a tune rarely recorded.This is some of the greatest Lester, a real masterpiece; for Lester's playing,but also for Teddy Wilson,Jo Jones,and for an amazing Roy Eldridge.I guess you'll play this tune for hours.Roy 's solo on this tune ranks among the greatest things ever done on a trumpet.The four other tunes are very great moments of music too: Lester's improvisations on "I didn't know what time it was" or "this year's kisses",a tune he recorded with Billie Holiday some 20 years before.The Jazz Giants is a good title: noone will ever play that way+music
Rediscovering Rick+P+If you are looking to relive some favorite tunes from the past, "The Day After Yesterday" by Rick Springfield is a good one!!!  However, if you are looking for "Jessie's Girl" and "Don't Talk to Strangers," this one is NOT for you.  Although this offering differs greatly from much of Springfield's most popular tunes, I like it!!!  As a fan rediscovering Rick, I appreciate what his mature voice lends to each cut.  This album helps to confirm my belief that musicians (just like everyone else) should change and grow, take divergent paths, explore, rediscovery, etc. and not stay the same - play the same tunes in the same old way.   Rick's last album, "Shock/Denial/Anger/Acceptance," contains many raw and hard-hitting tracks.  This one does not.  Take it for what it is - he is not selling it as anything but songs that he wished he had written.  I appreciate the various offerings by an artist over his/her career span (buy this one and "Anthology -Written in Rock" released in 2005 and "Karma" in 1999 to see what I mean).+music
A Rare Bird+P+One of thoses rare combinations of perfectly executed content and content perfectly executed. One of the great rock albums not only of that decade but to date. That it was a first album is even more impressive. This is one I go back to again and again. +music
BUYER BEWARE - The 2001 Remaster by Universal Music/One Way.+N+Don't get me wrong. The music that makes up 'Phantoms' by The Fixx is absolutely unique and wonderful. The one star is aimed at the corporation(s) that now own(s) these recordings. In an attempt to give the fans of this music something to enjoy, Universal Music/One Way Records has screwed this one up - BAD. How? They reversed the stereo image. To illustrate this all you need to do is imagine that guitar part that was previously known to reside on the left in the stereo spectrum - in the "remaster" it is now on the right. While that harmony vocal that you had previously heard on the left of the stereo spectrum is now -yup- on the right of the stereo spectrum. Therefore, a complete reversal of the stereo image - in every song, from start to finish. Kids, this is a major bummer.  In 1984 I purchased the vinyl version of 'Phantoms', which I grew to quickly love. So when it hit CD for the first time I added that to my library without hesitation. But like many of those recordings that were transferred from the original analog tapes to CD format in the 80's, I found the sound of the CD lacking warmth and bass response. Because of that reason I hung onto my original vinyl through the years. Recently, when I learned that 'Phantoms' had been "remastered" and reissued - I was hoping to get the listening experience that this music so much deserved when it first hit CD. I am very sorry to say that it didn't happen with Universal Music's "remaster". It's a shame.   The fact that three years after the re-release (it came out in 2001) no one has publicly voiced their discovery of this not insignificant error is a little surprising to me. If I hadn't of A/B tested this "remaster" to both the original vinyl and the original CD release by MCA Records then I may not have caught the reversed stereo image error right away. Thankfully, I did, and HOPEfully someone will do something about it.  I would also like to point out that I am deeply disappointed that Universal/One Way Records did not use the original liner notes for 'Phantoms', which in essence DIScredits all of those people who were originally responsible for producing the music and getting it out there. I see no clear reason for leaving those people out and in their place only giving credit to the "reissue producer" and "remastering engineer". Again, all of this is regrettable and shameful because 'Phantoms' truly deserves much better.+music
Did not receive both disks+N+I ordered this for my father, and according to him, there was only one disk in the package.  Very disappointing.  He didn't want to bother with sending it back. +music
Phenomenal!+P+Well, I completely disagree with the negative review below, and I have a feeling that the gentleman who wrote it, who claims to be a mediocre picker of several instruments, will remain mediocre for his entire life.  Fiddle and violin are not the same thing.  As the old joke goes, the difference between the two is that you shouldn't spill beer on a violin.    To expect rural and traditional black fiddlers from the Depression to play fiddle like classically trained modern fiddlers like Mark O'Connor or Allison Krauss is like expecting your country Grandma to make Hazelnut-crusted filet of Chilean Seabass with a Pomegranate and Wasabi reduction for Sunday dinner, instead of pot roast and mashed potatoes.  It's an absurd expectation.  This is the music of real people.  Many of these musicians undoubtedly farmed or did other backbreaking labor all week, taking their only joy from the music they'd play on the weekend.  Their faithful listeners were in the same boat.  Remember that for many of these recordings, the concept of "jazz" hadn't been invented yet.  Bluegrass, for that matter, wouldn't be invented for a couple more decades.    Anyone with a genuine appreciation for American traditional and folk music will love this album.  Yes, some of the recording quality is a little bit rough (many of the songs sound like they're playing on an old turntable instead of on a CD), but it's completely listenable, not nearly as difficult to listen to as many other re-released gems from this era.  Listen to it with an open mind, and after you've heard the first few tunes, your brain will automatically tune out the static (which is minimal to begin with).    This album is one of the more brilliant re-releases and collections from this era.  Get an idea of what real people were listening to and playing in this time period.  You'll thank yourself for giving it a try+music
If you want to hear "fiddle" music don't buy this!+N+This is a review for normal people. If you are a fan of standard fiddle do not buy this CD. It is a bunch of badly recorded, half hearted, boring and sloppy songs thrown together on an overpriced CD. Save yourself $... or if you like this type of music just go buy some old Little Rascals episodes on DVD. Then you will get the same music you hear on this plus the bonus of the Little Rascals. Now I know why we think of Blues guitar players not fiddle players when this music is discussed. The other reviewers seem to think some of the names on this CD will be familiar to you. Don't believe them, unless names like "Abrew's Portuguese Instrumental Trio" or "Dixieland Jug Blowers" are familiar to you. I am just hoping to prevent normal music lovers from stepping into this pile and losing $... like I did. I play banjo, fiddle, mandolin, dulcimer and guitar all badly, but I could get a gig with these bands and probably improve their sound. If you are the artsy type that digs this kind of stuff and you can't wait to grow a goatee, turn the lights down low, fill the room with smoke (oops, bad for your health), put your sunglasses on and crank this baby up; I hope you don't mind being stuck by yourself all the time because no one else is going to put up with this lousy music. Go find something with Chubby Wise in it if you want to hear some real fiddle playing. Help support some little known, up and coming fiddle players that need to buy food and pay rent with royalty checks by buying their music instead of making these labels, that get this junky music for free or almost free, super rich+music
All the sixties classics+P+This compilation covers the period 1964 to 1971 - the stuff that really matters. The same label has released a double CD compilation tit1led Ultimate collection, which covers their later music as well. If you want their later hits, including Come dancing, that is the collection you should go for.  This contains all the classic sixties songs including You really got me, All day and all of the night, Tired of waiting for you, Dedicated follower of fashion, Well respected man, Sunny afternoon, Waterloo sunset, Autumn almanac, Days, Lola and Apeman. It also includes Dave's two solo UK hits - Death of a clown and Susannah's still alive.  The set is presented in chronological order beginning with their cover of Long tall Sally, a song that demonstrates their musical roots in R+B. They didn't stick to R+B for very long, becoming more of a mainstream pop group and continually changing their style thereafter. Nevertheless, their songs were always distinctive because of Ray's talent for making ordinary situations into extraordinary songs. My favorite Kinks song is Waterloo sunset, a huge UK hit but not an American hit. It is about romance at a railway station that I am familiar with, though I cannot possibly imagine what inspired Ray to write that song, but he was a genius.  The best tribute to the quality of their songs lies in the diversity of the covers that have been recorded by singers in several genres of music. Kirsty MacColl (Days), the Stranglers (All day and all of the night), Petula Clark (Days - and a French version of Well respected man), Cathy Dennis (Waterloo sunset, Sunny afternoon), Green day (Tired of waiting for you), Jimmy Buffett (Sunny afternoon), Van Halen (You really got me) and Barb Jungr (Waterloo sunset) are among those who have covered Kinks songs.  Despite the brilliance of some of the covers, here you get the chance to hear the original versions. If you just want a single CD of their sixties music, this one is as good as any you will find+music
A Grave Dissapointment+N+After all the hype I expected this disc to be great. Boy was I wrong. I love the Wailing Souls but I cannot even listen to this. What were they thinking??? A truly poor and weird output from one of my favorite reggae harmony trios. The first track, "Row Fisherman", is such a bad version of a great song. Skip this and buy Firehouse Rock or Face the Devil. Even better try and find a copy of their first (and best) lp from 1974+music
Too great  to cry +P+This album demonstrates how absolutely phenomenal a singer and fiddler Alison Krauss since her early teens! Sheer delight to trace her gracious development as artist, leader, and influence over the decades+music
They could have made a better compilation+N+I don't want to pinpoint any one of the releases in the Anthology series because they're all guilty of just being thrown together with alternate takes, television outtakes, inferior rough recordings and false starts.  The unrleleased material (that which has been bootlegged for years), however, is what brings us out of the overbearing potpourri.  I have always been a fan of the unreleased early material including the Decca record audition tracks.  In fact, the first side of A1 could have done without the spoken word breaks and got down to some rock and roll, but if they only started from track 10 ("My Bonnie") and stopped at "Lend Me Your Comb" only to tack on "Leave My Kitten Alone" and leave it at that.  But that's just one example of how this should have been executed for release.  The other two Anthologies are worthy of scrutiny as well.  This is yet another disappointment for me such as was with Rubber Soul when I first bought it on CD.  The fact that the Beatles were going to give a good portion of their unreleased material the light of day got me excited until the day the Anthologies were released.  I give two stars particularly for the two new John Lennon songs that were Beatle-ized for this 6-disc compilation though+music
estrella  morente+P+an amazing singer!  she is fantastic and the entire album is wonderful.   Great selection for lovers of flamenco and Spanish music+music
cd song selection for this box set could of been much better+N+of all the billboard cds, this box set of 85-89 does not contain enough of the top hits of this period. most of the songs are of the flip side vintage. the grouping and selection of songs surely does not reflect the  top hits of 1985-89.a far cry from the best of billboards efforts on  previous years. for myself, a disappointment+music
The bomb!+P+If you didn't know him from Hootie and the Blowfish, don't worry, you didn't miss much! But, if you don't purchase this CD, you will be missing a lot! He is courageous to buck against the record companies and go independent! Thanks Darius because this CD is the bomb! If you don't want to take my word for it, just listen to Wild One! Great song to put in your car's CD changer to drive to this summer+music
UGH+N+Terrible. I LOVE alternative music, but this trash is hardly worth listening to.  I understand this is "experimental" and "innovational" but it is a loose can of worms. None of the music is melodic. Some of the riffs are pretty neat with interesting rhythems and intruiging sounds but when Thurston Moore or Kim Gordon (who was 39 when this was recorded. Waaaay past her prime if you ask me) tries to sing, it all falls apart.   The guitarists are very, very talented and deserve recognition. But, honestly, I can't see how they can't be like the Pixies and be talented but produce GOOD and LISTENABLE music at the same time. I gave it 2 stars because "Drunken Butterfly" Is an awesome song and actually worth listening to all the way through+music
George Winston?+N+If you like the music of George Winston's earlier albums, especially the "seasons," December, Plains, Forest, Montana.....you will probably not like this one.  Unfortunately, it is nothing like his earlier works.  I would never have fallen in love with his music if it was all like Gulf Coast Blues.  This new one is way too heavy, loud, and generally abrasive.  I am very sorry to have to say these things, because I am such a big fan of his.  +music
Not up to George Winston's Standard of Excellence+N+I was disappointed in this CD and have only played it once.  There was nothing about the music that "grabbed" me or even made me identify with New Orleans jazz or blues.  Not what I expected, but I was still happy to contribute to the hurricane relief effort. +music
A musician tells it like it is..Rodgers rolling in his grave+N+Unfortunately, I read the other reviews posted here and bought this recording based on the glowing sentiments expressed.  Hmph.  If this is what people think a great recording is, then musicality has certainly taken an alarming turn for the worse.  A few people did mention that the voices might not be the best, but seem to think that this is a small matter.  Guess what -- the two lead singers ARE pretty darn bad, and to me it's a big deal.  They are marginal singers, at best. I can only assume that acting and dancing are valued more than truly beautiful voices anymore, and that the music is taking a back seat to more visual concerns.   It was actually, quite literally, painful for me to listen to the tracks sung by Riding and Hayden.  Every time that we want a musical delivery, we're cheated of the pay-off.  Rodgers and Hammerstein created works of genius that are pure musical wonder, and this particular work deserves passion, feeling and true musical prowess from the performers.  This recording sorely lacks these qualities.  The only redeeming qualities - the singing of Clive Rowe as Enoch Snow and nice conducting in the Prologue.  Otherwise, save your money and - no, don't save your money - buy another recording like the old one with Shirley Jones and Gordon MacRae and listen to some good voices.  Really.  Trust me.  I have a fine set of musical ears and I know voices+music
Part of history but the music is very ... BAD+N+The music on this anthology disk is very bad.   You have to "want" to like the Germs. You must have alternative motives. Your mind must already be set before you press "Play" for the first time. Maybe somebody cool that you know liked the Germs or maybe they were name dropped in a magazine you like or that guy from the Offspring wearing his blue circle logo Germs T-shirt is burned deep in your psyche... maybe you just like the name "Germs"? It is a cool name for a band and they do have a cool minimalist logo.  If you were to first encounter this music blindfolded wearing headphones and without any knowledge that this music is the Germs, you would likely rip off the headphones, take a couple asprin and run for the hills.  Why? because this music is just plain BAD+music
Good album+P+This ablum contains all of the Germ's singles and their only studio album. This is an incredible punk album and belongs in your album collection if you're a fan of punk. Everything in the CD is perfect except the fact the Sex Boy has horrible sound quality (but whats funny is that on the last page of the booklet it says ''We make NO apologies for the sound quality of any of these recordings) but its quite funny to hear the choas that is going on while they perform. I highly recommend this collection of recordings+music
Smif-N-Wessun - Dah Shinin+P+After Black Moon dropped "Enta Da Stage" in 1993, people knew about Boot Camp was about. Then 2 years later in 1995, Smif N Wessun came up with a CLASSIC debut album! This is the second album to come out of the Boot Camp Clik. If you thought Black Moons "Enta Da Stage" was classic, then you HAVE to pick this up now!!  The lyrics on this album are on point all the way through. Words about life on the streets, fakes, and just all that hood and real hip-hop! Lyric wise, youll feel the same type of lyrics like those from Black Moons debut album. They wont dissapoint!  The production on this album deserves these words... Insanely dope! If you  heard Black Moons first album, you knew that "Da Beatminerz" were on about every track, youll find the same thing here! Da Beatminerz are back for more DOPE beatmaking! I don't think there is one weak beat on this album, you got those heavy bass, and just straight bangers!   To sum it up, just like me tell you this. If you like Boot Camp, Black Moon, Heltah Skeltah or any of it, or good hip-hop, do not... I repeat.. do not pass up picking up this album! Its DOPE!!!!  My Top 5 Songs 1.Wrektime 2.Wontime 3.Bucktown 4.Cession At Da Doghillee 5.Wrekoniz+music
Not John Lee Hooker+N+Well, of course it is John Lee Hooker, but these slick, mushy recordings are very, very far from Hooker's gritty 40s, 50s and 60s waxings, and songs like the saccahrine, string-laden "Six-Page Letter" are even wussier than the worst of his late 80s/early 90s guest star recordings. Hooker obviously didn't have a chance to listen to the final mixes. Whatever you do, make sure you listen to this album before buying it+music
Decent effort+P+For the record I'm not really a Dry Kill Logic fan per say. I own their first two records and I've heard all of the new one. I'd have to say The Dead and Dreaming is their "crowning" effort. Now first off, nothing about this band is really original. There were already so many metal bands out there playing these same old riffs for over ten years so by the time DKL came around it was already old. However, the crushing energy and agression cannot be ignored. The mellower parts are very boring and when he sings it sounds like Linkin Park-esque vocals. Nothing special there. So anyway, if you like your metal loud and angry, but low on the technical and originality scale then Dry Kill Logic is for you. This is their heaviest album and packs a punch. Better than Limp Bizkit, Korn, Hatebreed and all that mess, but I'll still stick to my Slayer, Opeth, and Testament albums+music
Santana Goes Back On Top+P+Moonflower put Santana back into the charts, and back into the major music mainstream.  This is the first Platinum album since Santana III in 1971.  Moonflower went on to sell TEN MILLION copies worlwide.  The two preceding albums, Amigos and Festival, got Santana out of the heavy jazz fusion genre, and back into more "radio friendly" Afro-Cuban rock, like the early days.  A few hits came, e.g. Dance Sister Dance, Let It Shine, Let The Children Play, etc.  But not until She's Not There did Santana REALLY crack the charts.   The whole album is extremely good.  All of the live tracks are superb.  There is not a single weak spot on the album.  The bonus tracks are extra.  The album would be just as good, maybe even better if the bonus tracks weren't there.  They are completely unnecessary, shortened versions of the original versions on the album.  But you can just skip those. Get the album+music
A revelation revisited+P+I have been listening to this record for about 25 years, so when this newly engineered release came out I was eager to hear the new tracks. They are stunning. I Once Loved a Boy is especially tender and tinged with that slightly bitter, ineffable Joan Baez melancholy that no other singer I know of in folk music has captured. There is and has been no other voice like this in popular music. Listen to this CD and you will put down every other singer songwriter du jour for a long while. This is in another dimension+music
Quite possibly their best yet+P+This album is battling to become my favourite Sugababes album. It is in competition with Three, which is magnificent.  This album, the last with Mutya, has some of their finest songs to date and some brilliant production and lyrics. At only 11 tracks long (12 if you have the UK bonus track, which I don't), it seems short, but packs a lot into those 11 tracks. My rundown:  01. Push The Button (9/10) The lead single of the album, this was No.1 in the UK for 3 (I think?) weeks. It's immediately catchy and very easy to sing along to. Keisha leads most of the song, with Mutya and Heidi singing the verses. Fun, upbeat with a saucy video.  02. Gotta Be You (9/10) Another upbeat song, this is really catchy, with a repetitive chorus that you would expect to get boring, but somehow it doesn't. The first time I played this, I was like 'Boooooring' but now I love it, it's a lot of fun to sing along to. The girls share vocals out throughout the song.  03. Follow Me Home (10/10) This ballad is reminscient of songs from Three like "Caught In A Moment", "Too Lost In You" and "Sometimes". That, my friends, is a very good thing. This song is beautiful and moving - I absolutely love the chorus, it's amazing! Heidi is absolutely brilliant on the middle 8, and Mutya and Keisha do the remainder of the song well. One of my favourites!  04. Joy Division (9/10) Another upbeat song, this song is slightly strange with peculiar lyrics music. It's catchy with singable bits throughout. I don't know why it's called "Joy Division," they don't mention those words anywhere in the song. Anyway, a good song, if strange.  05. Red Dress (7/10) This is the Babes new single and first single with Amelle. I wish it wasn't and that they had chosen something else, this is one of my least favourite tracks on the album. I don't know why, but this song is bland and uninteresting to me. The chorus is slightly catchy though, and Amelle does improve the song somewhat.  06. Ugly (8/10) This song is probably my other least favourite. The Babes Christmas single, this reached No.3. I loved it on the first listen, but after repeated plays, it has gotten boring. "Ugly" has a brilliant message behind it about accepting people as they are and not judging people by their looks, but to me, it's bland and boring. But it's Mutya's last single with the group, so good on it.  07. It Ain't Easy (9/10) The shortest track on the album, clocking in at 3:05, this is fast paced and upbeat. The chorus is really catchy, and gets caught in your head instantly. Before you know it, the song is over! But that's a good thing, it keeps your attention with it's short length.  08. Bruised (9/10) This song is incredibly cool, it's very chilled out and relaxed, until Keisha starts singing the bridge. This song is another catchy one, and I like singing along to the chorus, which Heidi leads. Another very cool track.  09. Obsession (10/10) I didn't even know this song was a cover until recently. But even if it is, it's brilliant! The lyrics are kinda random, about being obsessed with somebody, but the girls' vocals are really cool. Very catchy with great music.  10. Ace Reject (10/10) This song is wonderful! Heidi's middle 8 is absolutely brilliant, her vocals and the lyrics are just amazing. The song takes almost 2 minutes to get to the chorus, it's a different format of song then just verse-bridge-chorus-verse-bridge-chorus-middle 8-chorus. Very cool song, with a catchy chorus (when it finally kicks in).  11. 2 Hearts (10++++/10) This is it! The very last track on the album is my absolute favourite. This song is absolutely, utterly amazing. Heidi leads the majority of the song, singing the first verse, first bridge and leading the chorus, whereas Mutya sings the second verse and Keisha sings the middle 8. This song is so beautiful - full of amazing instrumentals (especially the ending) and a wonderful chorus with great lyrics - "2 you's, 2 me's, 2 minds to please" is just one line. I absolutely &lt;3333 this song so much, one of my favourite Babes songs ever!  Overall, the album's quality of songs is amazing, apart from two songs, the rest is high quality and brilliant. A great 4th album, look forward to more from the Babes with Amelle+music
Getting better all the time.+P+The first two CD's were wonderful ( Five star ), but on a scale of 1 to 10, I would rate this CD a 11+. The Greencards just get better and better. This CD has about everything an album could ask for. Just enough slow material and then they crank it up with some great picking. The vocals are as perfect as you can get. Carol Young is one of the best female vocalist out there today, bar none. Emmon and Kim join in for great harmony and lead singing, plus their playing is incredible. This band is fast becoming the best of New Grass since the New Grass Revival split up. Buy this CD if you love great music. It will have you patting your foot and singing along. +music
Truly, welcome to the suck.+N+And this year's crud-fest winner, the person who received the most votes from every brain-dead glossy eyed plankton watching ..... who even CARES anymore?  Yet another drone pulled off the production line, this gimp being another in the long run of Inoffensive Handsome White Boys, aimed primarily at stupid people and, judging by the popularity of this single, there are an awful, awful lot of.  So let's talk about the single. With the exception of the excrement that was last years winner (Steve Brookstein, currently Missing In Action - yet another one-hit wonder who we'll never see again) first (and only) solo attempt - the dire Phil Collins cover, this is easily the worst actual attempt at a SONG yet.  Originally planned for Westlife, "That's My Goal" was panned and rejected by them (THEM! Westlife!) for being too weak, but it sure wasn't weak enough for Shayne Ward, currently number one for the fourth week running as I type this.  But what does that MEAN, exactly? I'll tell you - nothing. The general public are SUCH idiots, such pathetic, "tell us what to buy and we will" easily led cretins, that they would buy ANYTHING after seeing it on a reality program. Shayne Ward could have released a record of him whistling the Marmite theme and it would have gone straight to number one.  And it's going to continue, isn't it? This was a massive hit, the show was a massive hit, so we're going to continue to be bombarded with bland, generic singers and pointless songs like this. If you BOUGHT this junk, or if you WATCHED this junk, The Curmudgeon holds YOU personally responsible. You should be ASHAMED of yourself for bringing yourself down to the gutter masses, watching this easily-digestible pond-life program, and buying its cynical, disgusting products.  One day, I hope to live in a world where television is not swamped by reality television, where TV schedules and budgets are not ruled by programs aimed at the great unwashed, where the charts are not in the vice-like grasp of dire TV talent show winners (and losers). That, ladies and gentlemen, THAT, is my goal.  The_Curmudgeon_Hates_You@yahoo.co.u+music
awesome, it shows ammons at his absolute best!+P+This is a great recording to say the least, but i have to say, stitt has played better. his work with bud powell and sonny rollins, i thought was better than this.  that said, it is a classic. ammons is in top form, check  him out on counter clockwise and blues up and down.  there is a great sense  of atmosphere, like you're really there, with stitt hooting ammons along in  his solos.  The rhythm section is more than solid, and it should sit right  up there inthe best of your collection+music
All I Feel I Hope+P+I truly enjoy this whole cd. I own all of Toad the Wet Sprocket official releases. I have never been disappointed by any of there releases. Still, I do have which one of their releases are my favorites. This cd is one of the favorites...if anything for the track "Hope." A beautifully haunting ethereal song which I enjoy playing on those cloudy rainy days.   Great lyrics, great musicianship, and great artistry. Great work from these guys....Well done!!!+music
Their worst effort yet+N+I am a long-time fan of the boys from Brum and can honestly say that this release is horrid. They recorded the disc as a disjointed unit where everything befroe was as a team. The slick effort and reliance on electronic music shows big time.  I have played their other discs non-stop throughout the years but "Homegrown" is one that was played three times and each time I never got past track #4.   Save your cash on this one. A truely bad effort. They did, however, hit gold when they recorded their recent "Who You Fighting For." Now that one is worth the $$$+music
Don't buy if you have iPod+N+The songs on the CD are great.  Jane Monheit has a beautiful voice and she performs several christmas classics well.  This "enhanced" version is horrible however.  Sony has "enhanced" this version of the CD so that you cannot import the music into iTunes and then subsequently play it in your iPod.  You can only use it in Sony digital players+music
A Classic!+P+Faith No more, Classic Melodies, Eternal Tunes, Quirky Lyrics angel dust for sure! Songs I never get tired of hearing, even after years and years. Mike Patton is a complicated one-man orchestra not out ther for to make the easily digestible. Subtle musical intricacies and weaving insrtuments, I hear something new every time. Composition wise, I'd rank him up there with Mozart. A few songs fall a little short,  but where they're on, they're very on+music
Happy Birthday, Association!+P+It was 1968, and The Association, hot off the success of their third album, "Insight Out," and it's monster hit single, "Windy," went back into the studio and recorded their fourth album, "Birthday." Once again, this classy sextet deliver some of the best flower-power pop-rock ever made. These catchy, melodic songs are truly awesome, highlighted by the band's expert musical chemistry and vocal harmonies. The album includes more Association classics as "Like Always," "Everything That Touches You," "Time For Livin'," and "Time It Is Today," but also such great buried treasures like the punchy "Come On In," the beautiful "Rose Petals, Incense And A Kitten" (a silly title, I know, but the song is truly gorgeous), the equally exquisite "Toymaker," the haunting "Barefoot Gentleman," and the excellent "Bus Song," featuring a great bit of barbershop vocalising in the middle. When it comes to pop-rock, The Association were (and are) true geniuses. "Birthday" is a brilliant album, one of the band's best.  +music
The reason why shred is dead+N+When I was 15 and first discovering guitar, I loved this album. Listening to it now, it just sounds incredibly soulless and cheesy.Vai is technically very impressive, but the man can't write a decent song to save his life. Vai's modus operandi is to get a bunch of faceless studio musicians, lay down a generic rhythm track, and go wheedily wheedily wheedily whee for an entire album.  Technique on your instrument is never a bad thing, however, technique should be just a means to an end, not the end itself. And that's what no shred guitarist seems to understand. The fact that shred guitarists like Vai aren't more popular is due to one thing: they're more concerned about playing faster and more cleanly than the next guy rather than writing songs. There's a GOOD REASON why non-guitarists hate this stuff.  Basically, once you get past the "Gee, that's neat" factor, this album, and nearly all of Vai's music, feels incredibly stiff and lifeless.To be blunt, this is what John Tesh or Yanni would sound like if they played guitar rather than keyboards. Not only that, his guitar tone is absolutely awful. Very thin, high pitched, and brittle sounding.  The best thing on here is the blatant Van Halen rip-off "The Audience is Listening": the rest is just masturbation. Vai's best work has always been as a sideman, especially the stuff he did with David Lee Roth, because then he's forced to play actual SONGS, rather than 5 minute long, tedious guitar solos. On his own, he's just unbearable. I considered giving this one star, but I gave it 2 stars due to the fact that Vai CAN play, it's just WHAT he's playing that's the problem.+music
America lose focus of their strengths+N+America's first album from 1972, the self-titled one, was a masterpiece. This is the third album (as the title suggests) from 1974. So what's it like?  I find that this band have very rarely focused on what they are good at, that is acoustic pop. Too often they have tried to be an eerie, progressive rock band, a funk band, an adult contemporary band and what not. Only the self titled album, some of it's folow up (homecomming) and 'Human Nature' from about 25 years later deal with what America are all about, country guys singing about countryside and birds and how we could all live a better life if we relaxed more.   The problem with "Hat-trick" is that it doesn't play to America's strengths, at all. It tries to be a progressive rcok album and mixes in all these airy-fiary psuedo-satanic lyrics into their music. Like the 8-minute title track is about a broken teenage love affair, but then they start saying "You're a bat out of hell", but it doesn't work. If you're going to sing about "Bats out of hell" sing it with conviction, like Dewey sings on something like "Hangover", don't sing all soft. I mean they are a soft-folk rock band trying to sing about scary monsters getting you in the middle of the night.  On the plus side you get the tracks on the Greatest hits album; "Muskrat Love", "Rainbow Song" and "She's Gonna Let You Down", all vintage 70's pop. I can't remember anything memorable from the other songs. "Green Monkey" and "Molten Love" try to sound so scary, but don't. "Willow tree lullaby" is the best of the rest but doesn't feel like much more than a card-carrying folk track that feels rather throw-away. Overall I would give the album about 3/10 (1.5 stars)  They never really recovered from poor directional decisions, though have made some pretty good music since, though the best album since their first album is surely "Human Nature".  That bitchin' done, don't hesitate to add this one to your collection and I hope you enjoy it, because, why did they make the album? For someone out there to enjoy themselves while they listened to it. This "old scrooge" didn't, but hopefully you do.+music
A great compilation+P+I really like Al Stewart's style - he has an easygoing, yet catchy style that is definately his own. He's a little like Gerry Rafferty, a little bit Beatle-esque and a tad bit like Bob Dylan, but he's got his own great style. This compilation is very good, it hits all the high points and has excellent sound. My favorite songs of his were always "The Year Of The Cat" and "Time Passages", but all of the songs are very good and listenable. I highly recommend this CD to anyone who likes good folk/soft/pop rock+music
Not as Good as I Remember it Being+N+I had this one in high school.  I remember loving it.  After purchasing it, I realized it wasn't as good as I remembered it being.  Granted, it has brought back quite a few memories, but I don't really know if they're really worth remembering.  It's up to you, buy it if you want+music
Shipping+N+The product was great; unfortunately, I ordered it in December 2006, with a promise of delivery around Jan. 9.  The CD did not arrive until January 26th!!!  I almost reordered it by that time.  What happened here?+music
Burrell & Trane+P+Burrell (g) Coltrane (ts) Tommy Flanagan (p) Paul Chambers (b) Jimmy Cobb (d) 3/7/58.  Trane was in his "sheets of sound" period at this time, and he and Burrell make a good pair. FREIGHT TRAIN is an up-tempo blues that is excellent; another blues on the CD is BIG PAUL, which at 14-minutes is just a tad too long. NEVER KNEW and LYRESTO, both taken medium-up, are also very good. Flanagan is his usual impeccable self. Excellent early work by all the musicians involved+music
Great+P+This is a great compilation and theres not a bad track on it. To Heathcliff an earlier reviewer thers is a lot more to completing your Australian Triology than Midnight Oil, Men at Work and Inx have a look on Amazon at some of these other Australian acts-AC/DC,Little River Band,Air Supply,Cold Chisel,The Church,The Easybeats,Rose Tattoo,The Angels,Silverchair,Living End,Hoodo Gurus,Hunters And Collectors,Nick Cave+music
A personal favorite by Renaissance+P+This 1975 release shows Renaissance at a peak and the excellent music on this album certainly reflects this - it is a personal favorite in fact.  I really appreciate the craft that the band put into their music; not to mention the emotional sophistication and superb musicianship.  This album is an especially fine example of these qualities.    The music of Renaissance is very disciplined (I really appreciate this) for a rock band and the instrumentation and playing style is more in keeping with a symphony orchestra than a rock band.  Keyboardist John Tout uses the acoustic piano exclusively with some minor pipe organ and harpsichord work, along with a string synthesizer - it is used effectively throughout the album and marks a point where John started using synthesizers more.  Electric guitars are absent and Michael Dunford employs both strummed and picked parts on the acoustic guitar, which further emphasizes the classical approach.  In fact, it is only John Camps virtuosic bass playing on a trebly Rickenbacker bass and to a much lesser extent, Terence Sullivan's drumming that lend the rock aspect to the compositions.  To emphasize the classical "thing" even further, an orchestra is featured on this album, and this may very well be their most classically influenced record.  Saving the best for last though, Annie Haslam has one of the most stunning altos I have heard - the delicate textures of her voice are both positive and uplifting.    The pieces on Scheherazade include a single short track (The Vultures Fly High 3'04"), two pieces in the mid-length range (7'05" Ocean Gypsy and Trip to the Fair 10'51), and finally the massive multi-movement Scheherazade suite (24'37").  The suite is a very sophisticated piece of music and is extremely well-arranged; with dense ensemble work and breathtaking dynamics.  The Scheherazade suite is incredible and my favorite composition by the band - I think it neatly sums up everything that I love about their music.   In addition to the suite, there are some absolutely beautiful and haunting moments on this album including the track Ocean Gypsy, although all of the other pieces are very strong.   This remastered effort by Repertoire is not too bad at all and features great sound quality along with a brief band bio and a few photos.  In summation, this is a wonderful recording made during the period of peak creativity for this band (1973-1977) and is very highly recommended to prog fans that also appreciate classical music. If you like this recording, also check out Ashes are Burning (1973); Turn of the Cards (1975); and Novella (1977)+music
My Favorite Corea Album+P+I bought this album after listening to an interview with Chick Corea on NPR over the summer last year.  In the interview he was asked the quintessential question: "What is your favorite album that you've put out over the years?".  His answer was this album.  The album stands up to that testament.  The emotion, energy, and talent of Chick and his band is incredible.  Every time I listen to this album I hear something new.  I'd give it 6 stars if I could+music
Ah, James....+P+James, you let me down, brother...I thought out of all the people in the world, you were gonna be the one that lived forever. I thought you were immortal, super-bad, and impervious to death. That's okay, man, I forgive you. You will continue to live on in my heart, my mind, and of course, in my soul with your great recordings. I know that wherever you are now, James, you are makin' it funky.  Thank You for blessing my life... +music
At last!!+N+At last!  I can say that I know what a castrato being tortured with a power drill while an infinite number of monkeys scrape an infinite number of fingernails across an infinite number of blackboards sounds like.  Thanks, Mandy+music
Hallelujah Jaleo!+P+GYPSY SOUL is the wonderful follow-up disc to Narada's earlier release GYPSY PASSION. Together the two discs comprise two of the finest compilations of the "New Flamenco" style heard anywhere.   If anything, GYPSY SOUL is even more eclectic than its predecessor, exhibiting the talents of New Flamenco stalwarts like Jesse Cook all the way across the spectrum to Slash of Guns 'n' Roses fame. Slash's contribution is a restrained, yet heady melodic instrumental which would stun most of his usual fan base.   The disc shows all its contributors to be virtuosos, and the recording style (rather raw and untouched) brings out the earthy qualities of New Flamenco at its best.   +music
Utter Garbage, Cheap Record Company+N+Oh, I see... issue the original UK version with 4 songs, but leave off the U.S. version 5 or so songs? And you have plenty of room to fit them all (because the U.S. version clocks in at under 44 minutes, so adding 4 more tracks would have been a piece of cake)? Just more scumbag tactics from record companies reissuing CD's. Strummer is rolling in his grave. Just say no, and STOP BUYING the MUSIC from these scam record companies. If you must BUY USED, so they won't get your dough!+music
Waste of money+N+Watch out for the volume leveling mentioned in another review. Surely the compliers could have come up with a better sort order than by composer. The change in tempo/volume between pieces makes it impossible to enjoy. My two CD's ended up in the trash.  Ke+music
If you like classical music don't buy this CD.+N+Most of the tracks were chopped down to 3-4 minutes so some of the best parts of the compositions are missing.  I don't know what I was thinking trying to buy 40 classical songs on two CD's.  If you really want to enjoy the music you would do better to purchase a CD with fewer, but better quality tracks+music
awesome funky jazz band, definetly check them out+P+In the tradition of the meters, Galactic is presently putting out some incredible tunes. I listen to this whole CD and their other probably at least once a week, all the way through. I cant get enough. They are all  extremely talented. You have to buy this CD to understand what I am talking  about. It is not a boring CD at all. I recommend it even more if you like  the Meters. Check it out+music
This album is truly a musical gift+P+This album fell into my life by accident and I am glad it did. This album is a wonderful combination of wit/humor, earthiness, and tender moments. The lyrics combined with his rough and deep voice are wonderful. Not a word is wasted nor out of place. This album is a &quot;keeper.&quot+music
An 'Emotion' That Rings True+P+Following her deserved breakthrough with her last album EVOLUTION, Martina McBride continues her flirtation with the pop side of country with EMOTION, in which she delves further into her own brand of immaculately produced country(pop), resulting in her least country album to date. Fortunately, not only does McBride have the voice to pull it off with ease, but the continuing transition she's made over her last couple of albums towards pop is achieved seamlessly(and not with the jarring, heavy-handed feel of Faith Hill's inferior and overblown BREATHE). Again, one of McBride's key strengths is her choice of material, which always manages to balance fun, somewhat lightweight tunes('I Love You') with strong, well-written material('Love's The Only House', 'This Uncivil War'). As is typical, her vocal work is first-rate, particularly on the sterling ballad 'There You Are', which she manages to salvage from being just another typical rumination on the wages of love. Faith and Shania should pay better attention--this is how first-rate pop is supposed to sound+music
One of their most underrated efforts+P+Time And A Word (1970.) The second Yes album.  INTRODUCTION: Yes first came onto the musical scene in 1969, with the release of their self-titled debut album. The collaboration between singer Jon Anderson and bass player Chris Squire showed serious potential with the release of that first album. Sadly though, it was overlooked by the music-loving public of the day. The band would make it big, but that would take a few more years. The band's 1970 sophomore album, Time And a Word, was equally overlooked, sadly enough. So, just how does the second album from the classic progressive rockers fare? Keep reading, and you shall see.  OVERVIEW: -Time And A Word was released November of 1970. -The album was produced by Tony Colton. -The album's tracklist consists of No Opportunity Necessary No Experience Needed, Then, Everydays, Sweet Dreams, The Prophet, Clear Days, Astral Traveller, and Time And A Word. -The band on this album consisted of vocalist Jon Anderson, drummer Bill Bruford, bassist Chris Squire, keyboardist Tony Kaye, and guitarist Peter Banks. The band here was unchanged from the debut album. This was Peter Banks' last album with Yes; he'd be replaced by Steve Howe for the band's next album.  REVIEW: The two albums Yes did before Steve Howe joined the band are, without question, the most underrated works they ever did. It's a shame these albums get so overlooked, because they are nothing short of excellent. All eight tracks this album serves up are among the band's finest, and certainly among their most unique. I wasn't sure what to think of this album due to its somewhat mixed reputation, but one listen to it showed me that this was one of the finest progressive rock albums of its time. The songs on here sound nothing like anything the band had done prior or sense, meaning this is arguably the band's most unique-sounding album. These tunes are tough to describe and to put into words, but I'll do my best. The band kicks things off with one of my all-time favorite songs they ever did - No Opportunity Necessary, No Experience Needed. The songs combines classical-style orchestration with the classic organ-heavy prog rock this version of Yes is noted for. A solid opener, indeed. And then we move on to the second track on the album, Then. The underrated Bill Bruford is the star of the show here - his rapid drumming in the verses simply must be heard to be appreciated. And Tony Kaye's keyboarding is excellent, too (it's a shame he gets overlooked in favor of the more popular Rick Wakeman most of the time.) Next up is Everydays, a cover of a Buffalo Springfield tune. Like most of the band's covers, the song itself stays true to the original, but it gets a total revamp with plenty of organ playing and extended instrumental portions. And believe it or not, I just might like this version of the song more than the original! And then we have Sweet Dreams. I've always like this tune, because it's somewhat of the happy medium between the band's early pre-Howe material and the more popular stuff that would come later. Another underrated Yes tune. Track five is The Prophet, one of the best songs on the album. The first half is instrumental, and Peter Banks and Tony Kaye beautifully demonstrate their musical abilities on their respective instruments (it's a shame these guys got so overlooked in favor of their successors.) Once again, the song implements elements of a classical-style, orchestral piece, and as a whole this makes the song better. Following that tune, we get to Clear Days, the sixth song on the album. This is a slow and melodic piece with a low-pitched violin backing Anderson's vocals. It's probably the most Baroque-sounding thing Yes ever did. It's a shame they didn't make this song longer and a little more developed, because it could have been a masterpiece. Still, it's very good the way it is. Seventh on this album is Astral Traveler. The song's sound is absolutely brilliant, featuring a sort of "space rock" sound that sounds like the band's later material, but at the same time it sounds totally different. Hard to describe this song, but it's a good one! Closing things out is the title track. This is a slow, melodic track with excellent backing instrumentation. It definitely brings the late Beatles sound to mind. Overall, this track makes for a damn good finisher. And in the end, Time And a Word stands as one of the band's underrated masterpieces.   EDITION NOTES:  In the early twenty-first century, the Yes catalogue got a much-needed reissuing. The new versions of the albums feature remastered sound, expanded liner notes, and bonus tracks. These new versions of the albums on CD kill older CD issues dead. If you don't have the albums yet, be sure you get the remastered ones!   OVERALL:  In the end, Yes proves that they had the ability to make excellent music from the very beginning. Who cares if it doesn't sound like the band that most people know and love? The music itself flat-out rules. It also goes to establish just how talented the underrated Tony Kaye and Peter Banks are - it's a shame their successors in Yes get all the credit from most fans. Oh, well. Final verdict? If you're new to Yes, you might want to start with The Yes Album or Fragile. This is a great album, no questions asked, although there are better starting points. That said, though, this is a solid album through and through, and it belongs in the collection of every Yes fan.+music
Unjustly Overlooked+P+I was just telling my boss about this record today! To be honest with you, the first two Yes albums are better than the more bombastic and commercially-successful records which follow. The original band focused on short, intricately-arranged, pieces. Yes started out thinking "How beautiful and interesting a statement can we make?" and ended up thinking "How can we impress the audience with our musical cleverness?" These two records are often compared to the Beatles, but I think they also show the influence of "Odessey and Oracle"-era Zombies+music
The 2 stars are for the first and last songs on the album.+N+This album begins with the great and classic song "Radar Love" and ends with the great and classic song "Twilight Zone."  Between those two songs is one hour of forgettable, mediocre music.  If you did not know better you would think that it was two different bands.  +music
Legends... wit this.... i think not+N+I like ATL i think there album Uncle Samz Curze is a underated classic. But LEGENDZ???? not a classic, not even mediocre, da beatz sound strained and da lyricz are tired. This only getz 2 starz cuz of da song Adventurez Of... easily the bezt cut on here, and one of da bezt of dere career. If u truly love ATL cop this, if u dont, find a way to get Adventurez Of... and leave this alone+music
Starts to go downhill at this point+N+In my opinion, Hank Williams Jr. - when he did it right - was about as good as it gets in country music.  You listen to his records like "Old Habits" and "Whiskey Bent & Hell Bound" and it is hard to get much better than that.  But with this album Hank Jr started showing glimpses of what would become his future...and it's not good.  He has a terrible version of "The Tennessee Stud" and everything just seems so overdone.  He's best on songs like "I Don't Care If Tomorrow Never Comes", "Ramblin My Shoes" and "All My Rowdy Friends Have Settled Down" - everything else is just filler.  And with future albums the filler would get worse until he eventually got to the point he would write things like "This Ain't Dallas" and "Fax Me a Beer".  Too bad, terrible waste of talent. +music
One of Elvis' best Camden albums on CD for the first time!...but with a few changes...+N+I always liked this LP, because it included some un-released studio and soundtrack recordings that had never been released before this LP first appeared in 1970. However, there have been a few slight changes in the CD version, which were kind of dissapointing. The song "Mama", which is an out-take from Elvis' movie "Girls! Girls! Girls!, is not the 2:12 mono version from the original LP...it is the 58 second, stereo version that was first included on the "Double Features" series. This shorter version was probably included because of the better sound quality and the fact that it is in stereo, although the actual reason is not quite clear. The shorter version is actually the original, the way Elvis actually recorded it. The longer version is spliced from Elvis' version and the Amigios version, which was probably done at the same session. This is the version that was used in the film, and Elvis probably liked it enough to record a version of his own...probably as a tribute to his mother. It is also possible that it was originally intended for the film, but never used. The other change here is with the song "Let's Forget About The Stars". The version included on the CD is the same take as the one on the original LP...however, the LP version included a piano track that is missing from the CD. Again, the CD includes the stereo version that was included on the "Double Features" series, probably because the original LP included the song in mono. It's possible that the master, which included the over-dubbed piano track, has been lost. Still, this CD is not a complete dissapointment, because the versions of these two songs included here are still very good. My only complaint would be that this version of "Mama" is much too short, and this LP only included 9 songs and had a short running time to begin with. These original Camden albums on CD are selling for only about 5.99, so at least they are not over priced, which makes them well worth purchasing. Still, anyone who has waited for this CD to get the versions of these two songs as they were released on the LP will be a bit dissapointed+music
ANDREWS SISTERS HAVE BETTER SONGS+N+Maybe it's because I grew up listening to the ANDREWS SISTERS, but I really had a hard time enjoying this disc. This is the second compilation of Boswell Sisters I've tried, and again, they just don't do it for me.  This disc sounded like the Andrews Sisters before they found their magical blend and the tunes themselves weren't very good either. It's not the Boswell Sisters fault, it's just that the great song writers (of the late thirties and early forties) were just around the corner. In my opinion, it seemed that 99% of the Andrews songs were GOOD, I felt that only a few on this disc were truly good. The arrangements were solid, but so were the Vic Schoen arrangements for the Andrews Sisters.   Sure, if there were no Boswell Sisters then there would probably be no Andrews Sisters, but I recommend the Very Best of the Andrews Sisters (40 Greatest Hits) [IMPORT] first.+music
Should Be Called Poop Diddy+N+Nothing hear, just the same aimless blabbing and complaining about how the streets currupted a young man. Whoa, if i could only make a song about my messed up childhood and make billions, I would be richer than these wannabe softees out int the hip hop scene.+music
Music For the Morning After The Day I Forgot+P+Putting in Pete's own words...It's Music For the Morning after the Day I Forgot. I'd say that sums it up. A great follow up. I perused a friend's copy of `Day I Forgot' on the way to Pete's House of Blues show in Cleveland in July. This is signature Pete Yorn. The disk is filled with obscure lyrics, wandering melodic twists, bizarre arrangements, unorthodox but brilliant production, and lots of guitar. I.E...Everything that should be expected in a Pete Yorn release. I was really glad I went to the show unfamiliar with this one. I really got turned onto some great new songs at the show. `All at Once' is the sleeping giant on this disc. An insightful and dark song about his father's failure to relate to those around him (I think). This album's `Closet' has got to be `Burrito' (coincidently also track 10).   If you like Pete Yorn, you'll love this one. BUY IT. My copy's on the way.   I might also urge you avoid saving a buck on a used one and to get a new copy (cast a vote). I don't mind buying used Garth Brooks discs, but Pete's still trying to claw his way up. We do want to see a third album. +music
Sorry to be a Scrooge...+N+...but it has to be said: While 'Martinis and Misteloe' is a swinging concept, it doesn't translate to a quality Christmas party-spirited cd -- in this case. From the first notes, and then the vocals, sadly it just never improves. However, negative reviews really should be accompanied by an alternative suggestion; here's mine: 'Ultra-Lounge: Christmas Cocktails, Part One'+music
GREAT TURNTABLISM+P+This is the best effort put together by these boys.The album has a steady pace that never gets odd like alot of turntable albums out there.I have alot of these types of albums and this one is one of the best.Great emcees grace the album here and there and the beats stay raw and the scratching sounds unrehearsed to give it a basement sound.I would not put my name on here recommending junk.THIS IS HIP HOP.In its purest form.All of my recommendations will satisfy the hardcore.50 CENT FANS DONT EVEN CHECK.MY LIST WILL NOT APPLY TO YOU+music
A MAJOR DISSAPOINTMENT+N+I have been a big fan of New Found Glory since "All Downhill From Here" came out. I bought Catalyst and loved it, so I bought all their old albums, loved them all too. I found out New Found Glory had a new cd coming out.....couldnt wait. So i go out and buy this cd the day it came out, I was that excited, I brought it home thinking "all right, this will be awesome!!!" Over the next 40-some minutes I experienced the biggest dissapointment of my life. Every song was a ballad, there were no fun songs like "Hit or Miss" "Forget My Name" "The Great Houdini" "Your Biggest Mistake" or even an amazingly well written song like "No News Is Good News." I basically got a whole cd of "I Don't Wanna Know" which in my mind was New Found Glory's worst song to date. I listened to this cd once, and I barely made it through to the end and when it was over, I seriously considered throwing it in the trash. This band has died, after all those years of fun and great songs, they have been destroyed. I will do my best to erase this peice from my mind so I can enjoy their old albums again+music
Lo fi go Hi fi+P+Pavement's last album(or arguably Malkmus' first solo record)sees them embrace a fuller,more streamlined sound that surprisingly (since their initial charm was their roughness)works in their advantage giving Malkmus' songwriting a more refined tone and enhancing the band's challenging musical detours. It's no "Crooked Rain,Crooked Rain" but "Terror Twilight" ends the group's run in an undeniable high(Carrot Rope,Spit on a Stranger and Cream of Gold are already among their classics)and it also gave very positive clues of what Stephen Malkmus' solo career would sound like.  +music
GOOD SONGS  AND  VALUE+P+this cd has a good sound and variety of their greatest hits. you must be a drifter's fan to enjoy this one.+music
epic crushing groove devestation...!!!+P+by the time that you get too the 2nd track on 'the red sea'it is too late.. you are quickly subjected to unmercyful desolet fury...i can not express enough, the hoplessness, and desperic rage that this song displays!!!the vocals are so incredible it sends me into a barbaric slam groove frenzy every time i hear it..this song has the most pummeling crushing spiteful slamming hatered filled breakdowns of any band in the scene..long live sludge cruch slam groove hatered..!!!i rate this album 100 stars!!!!+music
I cannot stand this guy at all+N+He has no real talent at all. He cannot rap, he has no flow, no lyrics, the beats can make you fall asleep. In short, this is the reason why rap music is so bad nowadays+music
this cd is awesome!!!!!!!! i love scandal!!!!+P+i have previously purchased the cd scandalous which at the time was the only way to find most of the material from their EP. that cd contains 4out of 5 songs. so it was a good collection. Then i purchased Patty Smyth's greatest hits featuring scandal because i was trying to get the rest of the group's material. while it is also a great cd and contains alot of their material ,it still left you wanted more. Now we have it! This cd is awesome. not only do you get all 5 songs from the EP but 4 never released tracks. I have to agree with the other reviewer, why didn't columbia just release all 9 songs and make a full LP?,and yes it would have been wonderful if they would have just put the rest of the warrior material on this release and completed the scandal collection they are all great. this is a real treasure. I also own The Warrior Cd. NOw all i need to complete my collection of Scandal/Patty Smyth is to purchase her 1987 self-titled solo album, which currently at amazon runs at about $25. i guess that isn't bad considering what a rarity that album is. highly recommend this to anyone who is a scandal fan!!! even if you own other scandal or Patty smyth CDs you will not have these 4 unreleased tracks. it is a must have!!+music
Above the Rest+P+I think that Mario Frangoulis is better than Josh Groban or Andrea Bocelli. His range is fantastic and his voice is so pure that it just speaks to your soul. He is reminiscent of the three great tenors, Carreras, Domingo and Pavrotti. He is the best of both worlds...pop and opera. Bravo Mario+music
An opera rip-off does not make you a great singer...+N+I was distressed and disgusted with "Sometimes I Dream" being a rip-off of "E lucevan le stelle", from Tosca.  He's not the singer for me....and his cover of "Nights in White Satin" was very ho-hum. Justin Hayward should have stayed with the Moody Blues for that one+music
No Masterpiece But Still A Good Album+P+Released in 1997. "Be Here Now" was Oasis third album and their last near great. At the time of it's release Oasis was among the most popular rock bands and whatever they made was turned into gold. There was no exception with "Be Here Now" that proves the bands craftmanship and lives up to the hype surroundig them. At first listen I thought that the album was a little overproduced with too much commercial appeal but the album is aging well and looking back at it now, I believe that "Be Here Now" is an very strong album. Afterall it was their last that sold really well all over the world and gave them several big single hits. The music is far from surprising, if you liked their first 2 albums and Noel's songwriting you will enjoy this one aswell. I think some songs were a little too commercial, but on the other hand it got loads of energic rockers too and it shows the bands diversity and craftmanship.  "Do You Know What I Mean" is super long with it's 7.42. It was also a pretty big hit in Europe but at the same time it also suffers from being too long and overproduced. Oasis had always done simple songs but for the first time on "Be Here Now" their success had gone to their heads, it feels forced with it's lenght, sound effects and solo's. Having said that, it's not a bad song but not what we wer used to. "My Big Mouth" is a classic rocker, that would have been great for their debut album. "Magic Pie" is also too lon with 7 minutes, it's a midtempo that Noel sings. "Stand By Me" was a hi single, and a quite typical Oasis song, midtempo, good chorus and good sing-a-long. It's defenitely one of the better songs on this album. "I Hope, I Think, I Know" is yet another rocker. "The Girl In The Dirty Shirt" is surprisingly good eventhough it was never a single release. A poppy midtempo.  "Fade In Out" is half-acccoustic with little instruments used and a soewhat bluesy sound, although it doesn't stand out at all. "Don't Go Away" is a ballad, and one of their best songs. The song is about losing someone that stand close to you, unfortunately it was only releases as a single in Japan. "Be Here Now" the title track is another trademark midtempo rocker. "All Around the World" that also was a single-release suffers from the same thing as the opener. It's too long with 9 minutes, it's overproduced (just look at the music video) and it's also too commercial. Sure, neither this one is bad at all, it good a meliodic chorus and has got a wonderful beatleesque ending with sing-a-long and heavy guitars, but it was a little too much. "It's Getting Better" a rocker and a reprise of "All Around the World" closes the album.  Overall, Oasis last near great album. Even if it got it's faults and is weaker then the first 2 albums, it got it's moments with both rockers, midtempo pop/rock and one very good ballad. The main problem is that some songs are too long. The whole album clocks at 70 minutes and was 25 minutes longer then the average Oasis album. At times it's just becoming too much and it feels like Oasis success has gone over their heads and were trying to be something they weren't at times, but needless to say, It is a good album with a fair share of good songs and looking back at it now it brings back memories when Oasis were at their peak and rules the charts. 4/5 stars. Good Purchase+music
Somewhat helpful+P+Rivka Simmons' voice is very soothing and encouraging, but her "meditations" have been only so-so helpful in easing my "stress".  Track 4, "Body Scan Relaxation" continues to leave me baffled.  (*How* am I supposed to "breathe" from my feet?)  Track 3, "Progressive Muscle Relaxation" has been more helpful+music
&quot;growing away from me&quot; is lousy quality recording+N+don't buy this cd for &quot;growing away from me&quot; as the recording sounds like it was burned from an old album, lots of pops and crackling. surely they could have found a better source tape or cleaned it up+music
This is the greatest cd ever.+P+The music in this cd is amazing. You should buy it+music
JohnnyLongStreet+P+It is true that this is a great collection of songs.   With that said, here are two complaints:  1) The audio snippets from the movie are built into the tracks, so they're tougher to skip through.  2) The audio transfer is terrible.  Somewhere in the process, either at the transfer or the mix, the audio thinned out.  There's a really weak bass end, and everything sounds thin and tinny.  Not that it ruins the experience, but for someone who's actually into how music sounds, you might look elsewhere+music
Better than Original...+P+Ever since I played Final Fantasy IX, I've wanted to buy a soundtrack of it. I thought of buying the Original Soundtrack, but it cost more than $25, and i didn't have that much money. So I decided on this CD and it was worth it. Most of the songs on this CD are even better than the originals, and I wasn't going to listen to most of the songs on the original so... It's worth every penny+music
Awesome cd+P+This cd by the best duo of our time do it again & there harmony i& playing of there guitars is just awesome. Id go out & buy this cd right away. George+music
Suicide+N+At a time when fine music is fighting for its life, Haroncourt delivers this. The sound is crystalline. Every voice is heard. The performance is dead, dead, dead. For the good of music, Harononcourt should remove the key that winds his clockwork heart and throw it away. This is the most lifeless performance of the Mozart Requiem on disk. Many more like this and classical music will be dead--it can take only so many defeats+music
Another good band falls victum of modern day emo crap.+N+I'm going to be straight up, the title says it all. Thrice was a great band, Illusion of Safety is one of the most incredable albums ever. Now they sound like every other band out there today. Personally I Hate emo, I grew out of that crap along time ago. I'm sorry if I offend people in saying that. I just dont see any talent in it. Thrice used to be my favorite band. Being a guitarist myself, I enjoyed Identity Crisis' true hardcore sound, and Illusion of Safety's amazing creativity, but the Artist in the Ambulance and this new CD are crap. If your emo, then give it a shot, but if your sick of the new-age emo crap you can't avoid every time you turn on the radio, put this album back. It's time to move on Thrice fans. They came.. they rocked.. there done+music
A Woodstocker Wanna Be+P+When I saw this movie, I just knew I had to get this soundtrack.  Music is from two genres of the time: the clean- housewifey-music, and the hippie-Woodstock music, to reflect Pearl's and Walker's backgrounds, respectively.  I have to say, though, that whoever thought to keep Richie Havens' &quot;Freedom&quot; off the soundtrack made a poor decision.  I made another copy of the cd and added the song myself by downloading it from the web.  I now feel it is complete and I have it on continuous play on my surround sound, staring at my lava lamp and wishing for the first time in my life that I were older so that I could have been a part of this great era of music+music
Engelbert is the &quot;ALL TIME  BEST&quot;!+P+I've been an Engelbert Fan for years! &quot;THE WAY IT USED TO BE&quot; became a favorite of mine when it was first released and has remained a special favorite for all these years.  I said back then he was the best!   He's still around after over 30 years, doing tremendously fabulous  wonderful concerts and new recordings!     WHAT MORE CAN I SAY--ENGELBERT'S  THE GREATEST+music
Can lead to even better things+P+Well if you have missed some of the efforts linked to the modern Brazil music scene than this puts a nice sampler together  for you. If you are already familiar and have come by way of the late Suba's &quot;Sao Paolo Confessions&quot; or Bebel Gilberto's lovely &quot;Tanto Tiempo,&quot; both so good that they deserved tributes or remixes, than you will be plesantly surprised by some of the other offerings. The problem with samplers is that they are just that, samples. Just when you are getting into a particular artist the track is over and you are suddenly listening to another one. The good news is that this can lead you out to purchase a full CD of the artists music.  Such was the case for me with Zuco 103. I found there sound sound inviting  and when I purchased one disc I had even had to have another! The version they perform of &quot;Outro Lado&quot; is sweet, slightly funky, dreamy, trippy  and like many of the tracks on this sampler, seductive. Zuco 103 also performs &quot;Treasure&quot; which is a bit more uptempo, bilingual(with interspersed English chorus) slightly edgy with a sprinkling of bossadelia that is not as good as the version featured on their CD but still very nice. Trio Mocoto's &quot;Os Orixas&quot; has a more carnival or futbol flavor where you can imagine the samba line grooving along . Bossacucanova fills in the dance lines on this sampler with jazz melodies for some soflty swinging atmospheric approches to create lounge Brazinujazz. All the songs contribute something  tasty to the CD and is recommended for a point of departure or to just sit and watch your own Rio sunsets +music
He wasn't made for dancing ... or singing+N+After reading several of the top rated reviewers here, I think it's time someone outside his family, or the people who work at his record company, had a say.   This album is complete tripe. He can't sing or dance. Still, he blows David Hasslehoff out of the water at least+music
"THE MILLION DOLLAR FACE"+N+TOO BAD HE CAN'T SING AS GOOD AS HE LOOKS.  THEY SAY BETTY GRABLE HAD THE MILLION DOLLAR LEGS.  HE HAS THE MILLION DOLLAR FACE [CIRCA: THE 70'S].  IF IN DOUBT--CHECK OUT HIS SECOND THRU FIFTH ALBUMS AS FOLLOWS:  SECOND ALBUM--BACK COVER THIRD ALBUM--FRONT COVER  FOURTH ALBUM--BACK COVER  FIFTH ALBUM--FRONT COVER.  FOR THE MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR FACE--CHECK THE SINGLE RECORD PICTURE SLEEVE FOR "RUNAROUND SUE".  IT'S ALL IN THE FACE--SUCH AS HIS. HE HAS ABSOLUTELY NO TALENT AT ALL--OTHER THAN HIS MILLION-DOLLAR FACE.  HEAR:  "THOUGHTS" AND "LOVE'S CRUEL" FROM THE FOURTH ALBUM [THESE ARE SOLO--NO OVERDUB] AND "MOVIE OF YOU" FROM THE FIFTH ALBUM AND "WHEN I THINK OF YOU" FROM THE SECOND AND *THIRD ALBUMS AND THESE SHOW WHAT A PRODUCER CAN DO WITH EVEN THE WORST OF THEM. THE RECORD COMPANIES IS AFTER ONLY ONE THING--THE PUBLIC'S MONEY. TAKE AWAY HIS MILLION DOLLAR FACE AND HE'D HAVE NOTHING. IT'S ALL IN THE FACE SUCH AS HIS MILLION DOLLAR FACE [THE 70'S].  HIS LOOKS: $$$$$$  HIS TALENT: NONE.  FOR A PHOTO OF THE MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR FACE--SEE MY IMAGE RELATED TO THIS ITEM+music
Buyer beware+N+There's nothing wrong with the performance: it's Gershwin himself, according to the editorial review, taken from a piano roll. "Music Experience in 3-Dimensional Sound Reality" it says on the packaging.  All I can say is, it's a thin excuse for a surround-sound DVD-Audio disc: the one track is the only thing on it. Maybe 15 minutes, total, though nowhere on the disc or its packaging does it mention the track list or the timing. Or that it's remastered from a piano roll, for that matter. And all at a premium price? You've got to be kidding!  Watch out for the entire DVD-Audio series by Alexander Goldberg Jero. I bought several, to fill out my DVD-Audio collection, and none have lived up to expectations+music
the unseen did a whoops on this one+N+i do enjoy the first ep's and the albums from these guys, however, this cd kinda landed way off the mark. The greatness of the past cds were the energy along with the catchy street punk sing-a-long songs. On this album the unseend didnt seem to give it much time and effort. Even a new version of one of there old songs couldnt save this from being a flop. sorry guy+music
Probably the Best CD I own+P+I bought this CD based on the movie sound track and have discovered that it is probably one of the best banjo CD's out there.  I highly recommend this CD for anyone even remotely interested in banjo music+music
the first live release+P+This is a very good album. The only reason I didn't give this version a five is because of the ommission of Bob's voice at the end of Lovelight. Get the original cd that still has Weir singing at the end of Lovelight+music
STORYVILLE FOLLOWUP+N+Leans towards the blues side.Heartfelt vocals.Lacking licking licks.Less driving than their debut+music
Sass, where are you?+P+This girl rocks! Her group is tight. She must be one hell of a live act. But... where's the follow-up CD? Everytime I go to a record store... 'cuse me, music store, I look for new Sass Jordan - it ain't there. Hope she's  OK...+music
best ever+P+My husband bought this for me 10 years ago and I wore it out.  I absolutely love it.  Luckily he was able to find me another copy.  I would buy more if I could find them+music
great song that's not on the soundtrack+P+just in case any of you guys were wondering what the song is that's playing during one of the strip club scenes with method man, it's called &quot;Bam Bam&quot; by Sister Nancy+music
Lady Of The Spice Lands+P+This is a great acoustic guitar record. I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys acoustic guitar finely played. The pieces are varied and focus on exquisite flowing melodic ideas. Chris Brenne's formidable technique does not overpower the beautiful intricacies of his compositional ideas, but instead serves the demands of each piece. The result is a record that has an integrity that attends to musicality first and foremost - sensitive, serene and strong playing+music
I'M SORRY BUT THIS CD DOESN'T EVEN MERIT ONE STAR+N+I really like Reba but she messed up so big on this CD that its pitiful.  Someone get me some Excedrin Migraine tablets please!!  I was nauseous after hearing this mess. +music
Missing+N+The song that ends the movie or is &quot;Send Me On My Way&quot; by Rusted Root. THAT is worth getting. Does anyone know what the other songs with singing are+music
JACI+P+WELL HERE I AM AGAIN BEST,BETTER,BUENO WHAT COULD I SAY+music
Country singer Vince uses orchestra for Christmas album+P+Vince, with is high tenor voice, is one of the finest singers that country music has ever poroduced - however, this album is not a country album. It is a wonderful Christmas album that should appeal to fans of easy-listening music by the likes of Andy Williams and others.  This was Vince's second Christmas album and (like the first) Vince sticks mainly to famous songs, being careful to avoid those that he included on his earlier album (Let there be peace on earth). The only unusual songs here are the title track (written by Amy Grant, who eventually married him and who has recorded three brilliant Christmas albums of her own), It's the most wonderful time of the year (which doesn't appear on Christmas albums as often as it deserves) and A cradle in Bethlehem (another excellent song that could do with greater exposure).  Vince is in superb voice throughout with the orchestra providing tasteful backing on every track. So, once you get over any initial surprise at hearing Vince supported by an orchestra instead of Nashville musicians, this album is exactly what you'd expect - brilliant+music
Thrash  music done right+P+There is a lot of screaming headbanging music out there. It is hard to sort them out. Bury your dead delivers brutal riffs with great growling vocals. If you like music with punch, this one is for you.  I would love to see these guys with throwdown. Yikes+music
Mediocre For Slayer, But An Excellent Piece Of Metal Nonetheless+P+I think it's quite obvious at this point that Slayer is an unstoppable machine of headbanging bliss that has little chance of losing its massive fanbase. They've come to be loved for their uncomprimisingly brutal take on thrash metal and the fact that they stick to their guns like no other band. Even when a hint of change is detected in their work, it's still Slayer and it's still satisfying. This strength is especially apparent with Diabolus In Musica.  Slayer has been going at it for over twenty years, and most of their songs have followed a strict code of conduct -- namely the speed. Some people complain that DIM leaves this aspect of Slayer's talent behind. Not so. It only reduces the amount of it -- and what's so bad about that? The trademark thrashing style is still found here, only it's accompanied by more of the slower, brooding riffs and drum work that, in earlier releases, didn't really dominate. Does slower mean less heavy? Absolutely not. I think it actually helps the music and gives it a darker feel. Not to mention makes the faster parts even more pronounced. For one thing, the myth of "slower equals boring" is clearly busted throughout the album.   As far as the music and song structure goes, I didn't think it sounded like "filler" material at all. These are classics in their own right. You can't expect Reign In Blood or other definitive Slayer albums to be surpassed, and I think the band is well aware of that. The riffs are still heavy, mean, and at times -- in a completely non-melodic way -- even catchy. The lyrics and vocal work are also a nice touch. With DIM, Araya is leaning more toward the shouting style that would later take on practically every line in God Hates Us All. A little more like a mix, though, between the old and new. The only low points in the singing were the breathy, moaning tones he used sometimes (thank goodness this usage was rare). It reminded me of Marilyn Manson or even some of these numetal bands. But by all means, contrary to common criticism, DIM is far beyond numetal. As mentioned before, it's still obvious Slayer material, just a bit evolved. Luckily, the lyrics stay firmly planted in that moody, anti-religious, almost poetic atmosphere Slayer has always had. And as for the whole "get Lombardo back on drums" deal, I didn't find Bostaphs's playing to be a problem at all. He adds his own taste in there, with some pretty good double bass throughout the album. So for those thinking that the absence of Lombardo might kill the mood, don't worry. The whole band delivers the goods as usual. Then again, how could they not?  Diabolus In Musica is a pleasant surprise. While it is easily overshadowed by the Slayer "classics", it stills lives up to the legendary band. It never falls off the line of hard'n'heavy mayhem that fans love, yet manages to give a little bit of an alternative approach at the same time. No matter the differences, it is a fine piece of metal and belongs in every Slayer fan's collection+music
Little Rhody's Finest!+P+Rhode Island boasts Throwing Muses and The Cowsills as two musical giants  coming from the smallest state. Now RI can add the duo of Daryl Sherman and  Dave McKenna! If you ever have a chance to see these two perform, don't  miss it!!!  Their latest CD JUBILLEE is their most amazing--wherever you  live, you can enjoy their great jazz+music
i dont dig on sountracks....+P+But I bought this one. Couldn't help it. The music was such a prominent part of the film, more so than any other film I've seen. It was a good film, ok. I'm not in love with it. But the music was in tune with the great parts of the film- never ever witnessed this before. Witness: Samuel Jackson slipping on the gloves and coldly assasinating Chris Tucker. Could that song, don't even know what it's called, be more shocking, fitting, pretty much every adjective. And then the end of the flick with Jackie driving with a tear in her eye singing along- I do the same thing without the tear. Truth told I didn't know much about this music before I saw the movie. But it makes me feel like I was there and that makes my life more exciting and that makes a good album. Pulp fiction OST was really good too but to put it straight up, Jackie Brown is black soul that white boys don't get the pleasure to hear. Boo-yah!+music
EL CORAZON+P+This recording will ground you to the earth, reconnect you with the soil  you came from.  There are many fine, beautiful compositions here. I listen  to them while bathing, along with the music I use oils, incense and  candles, it is a preparatory ritual. The beginning vocal track  &quot;Omiya&quot; is an uplifting spiritual piece from the heart. Another  fabulous composition is &quot;Red Hibiscus on Skin&quot; a soft synth track  with flute and other instrumentation.  &quot;Biki Is Insulted&quot; is a  heavy drum laden warrior piece with accompanying vocals which sound similar  to a tribal chorus.  &quot;A Cry From The Heart&quot; is a somber and  compelling layered male vocal piece complete with deep space atmosphere, it  is the introspective 'dark night of the soul' experience.  I must add that  it was quite some time until I actually appreciated the majority of KAMA  SUTRA.  You may have to let it sink in also.  When you are sinking into  your hot bath water allowing your heavy oils to penetrate your senses, it  will happen. It is most proper to use oils that correlate well with this  recording, such as sandalwood, patchouli or Dr. Singha's Mustard Bath (I  use this product).  Enjoy this life-altering music+music
Post bop heaven+P+A refreshing original melange of contemporary sax. If you are always on the hunt for new hard bop sounds, Chris Potter is turning out cutting edge compositions and blowing way the critics. I just saw his quartet in Montreal play to three standing ovation encores. Dont miss this album, surely to be among the best of the yea+music
Live Concert Versions of Bon Jovi's Greatest Hits+P+"One Wild Night: Live 1985-2001" by Bon Jovi, Is a compilation of Bon Jovi's best songs, performed at various concert events from 1985 to 2001.  For Bon Jovi fans, it's classic Bob Jovi and a Must Have!  If you like music recorded from "Live" performances, You will love this album!  If you prefer "Studio-Cut" versions, you may not like this album because it has the sound and feel of a live concert.+music
Thanks J. Darwin+N+Great list with original artists.  I can't believe they are selling the soundtrack with remakes.  Looks like I'm off to iTunes to see if I can find all these songs.   Thanks again+music
where's the others?+N+My Wife got Me this soundtrack a few years ago and I took it straight back. The problem is  it's missing about 50 songs that were in the movie, and the B.o.c. song Godzilla (from the album Spectres) is NOT sung by B.O.C. If all songs were included this would be the coolest soundtrack ever, but it's not+music
Agree.  Not as good as the original.+N+Every soundtrack sounds like the previous one because of slow, ponderous, heavy, sterile, dry interpretation of the themes. One just expects some brightness in the playing but this is never delivered.  This recording &quot;tries&quot; to have a story. Stick to the original soundtrack. 1000 times more enjoyable+music
I pledge Allegiance to Firewind+P+Allegiance is masterpiece of music and metal, seamlessly woven together in gigantic proportions.  Firewind has produced a classic album in the midst of a revival of metal.  I'm a child of the 80's, when metal ruled the world.  I have never been so excited as bands like Dream Evil, DragonForce, Hammerfall and more bring back metal to the forefront.  Firewind breathes some fresh air into the once dying beast of heavy metal.  Crisp, clear and powerfully vibrant vocals, extremely intricate and heavy guitar work, bass guitars that won't stop all synchronized with awesome drumming(complete with double bass drums!)  At times the vocals sounds like a blend of anything Jorn Lande has done mixed with a touch of David Coverdale of Whitesnake fame.  I just can't stop listening to the song called "Breaking the Silence"!  If you love metal, old or new, this is a must have for any true metalhead+music
One rare and great CD+P+I just love it. It's my second Villegas after Cafe Ole and I like it better than the first one. Vocals are intriguing - they lack the professional training and quality and that is what makes them refreshing. I consider it money well spent. I don't have musical training - I am a non-Latino male who is into Latin music+music
5 stars? You're kidding!!+N+This is easily the worst Sinatra/Riddle/Capitol record and I'm not surprised it's been unavailable for years.Sinatra wanted to record something with the Hollywood String Quartet and this is the result. He's in wonderful voice, but the material stinks and Riddle's scores are painfully dragging. He simply doesn't have enough musicians on these dates and the strings are headache inducing."Blame It On My Youth" is the standout, but you can keep the rest. The emperor has no clothes on this one +music
Another record company made band. Numetal that's all.+N+So many of these bands sound the same I think they should all just have the same name. How about The Sell Outs, or perhaps The Posers or maybe The Pretenders (oops that one is taken by a GOOD band already). That way, no one would have to pretend they have just discovered the one new band that doesn't really sound like the rest and isn't in it just for the quick money and quick fame. C'mon folks. Get real. These guys are just another nu metal band that won't be around in a year or two and I along with legions of others can't wait till this genre of music is gone and dead like disco. Temporary amusement for party background music while you talk with your pre high school friends and tell each other how cool this "new" band is, maybe. Quality rock music with soul, talent and heart, hardly+music
Old School Love+P+One of the best of original old school, I wish more of today,s music had the same demeaner as a lot of the eighties music, because a lot of todays music have the same sound. Give me old school anyday+music
I wish there was a lower ranking+N+Pink sucks. This is a horrible CD and horrible albunm art work. They gave her too much freedom on this CD since Mizzunderstood was a big hit. That is probably why her new song Stupid Girls is so catchy and sing-songy it makes me want to puke as well. But I guarantee they didnt let this wanna be riot grrrl go all hard core again. If they did, this new disc is bound to wind up in the .99 bin along with Try This. +music
You guys are crazy+N+What the hell is up with all these 5 star ratings?? Man. Meat Puppets 2 deserves 5 but this one?  Up on the Sun is full of lame guitar licks, annoying whistling, chanting, wtf?? MP 2 is like a piece of art while this one is more like a piece of crap, sorry guys+music
an embarrasment+N+I remember when this came out and as a guitar player myself, I was highly intrigued with the names involved on this project. My initial impression of April Lawton was to hang up my guitar and forget the whole thing (she is/was a damn good guitar player). Afterwords I realized that this album is quite an embarrasment. Their next release, the more acoustic In April Came the Dawning of the Red Suns is a MUCH better effort.+music
A Kids Review on there Mother's Name+N+I'm on my Mom's Amazon Account just to say my review for this CD. I don't have it, but I have all the songs on my Ipod that I like from it. Here's my ratings- Go The Distance- This freakin rocked so much. It's so emotional and beautiful! Color's Of The Wind- Techno sounds, love it! Find yourself- great. Two worlds- Nice.  Part Of Your World- Liked the beat. Kiss The Girl- I love this Pop Rendition! True to your heart- cool.  blah blah blah. I can't remember the rest only because I don't really like the rest so over all this CD was amazing!!!!!+music
This album has all the &quot;hoo-bangin&quot; hits of the 9-8+P+Big Pun, Busta, Snoop... all the artists who had the hit songs out that you could only get by buying their album have now been put on one cd.  At this price, it's a straight up deal+music
what a putz+N+i  heard this fruitcake justin was saying how lame and boring virginia beach was. well he's from memphis, tennessee. u can't get much wacker than that. what did he grow up on a farm or something? redneck. sounds lame to m+music
Iowa STATE?+N+Any album that lists the "Iowa Fight Song" followed by (Iowa State) can't be any good.  It's the University of Iowa Fight Song, not Iowa State University.  And from the preview I heard, they didn't do it justice anyway+music
Night Song+P+To be sure raw music is the best but this album is a sweet mix of voice and technology..and always makes me cry especially "my heart my love"..nusrat had a great gift from the Big Boss upstairs..miss him very much+music
Suzi at her Best+P+&quot;This is a quite a different compliation to most of the other Suzi Quatro compliations, this has not just been thrown together. It defines Suzi and her music just that bit better+music
Driver's Seat+N+Where the heck is Sniff n' The Tears' "Driver's Seat" in this soundtrack.  It plays at a definite changing point in the movie where Floyd comes to tell Jack that he needs to switch to video instead of film.  It's a travesty that this song wasn't included.  But a good soundtrack nonetheles+music
o my word+N+great! jus wat hip hop needs, another idiot comin up talkin bout cars n money. its no wonder nas sez hip hop is dead. unless the real mcs stand up soon, hip hop has no hop+music
A Disco Christmas - ACK!+N+I LOVE Christmas.  I love the festive atmosphere.  I love the spirit of giving and I love Christmas music.  This stuff, however, is downright painful to listen to.  A few tracks, with the slower tempo, can be tolerated in small doses, but the more "upbeat" number are too awash in synthesizer arrangements and come across as little more than "a disco Christmas" and severely test my love for the music of the season.  Destined for shopping mall PA systems everywhere+music
MISLEADING TITLE+N+It would have been better to label it "Best of Mannheim Steamroller Christmas"  than this misleading title.  It is just a rehash of selections from their previous albums; all of which I already have so this was a waste of $14 cause stores won't take back OPENed CD's.  (anybody got a shrinkwrap machine handy??)+music
Preview your wedding day+P+This CD was inexpensive, and provided a great way to preview songs for my wedding.  The CD had a good song selection.  My fiance and I were able to get a better idea of how the songs would be at our wedding. Definitely an inexpensive tool that is worthwhile+music
Buyer Beware+N+Huge Camouflage fan!  So, needless to say, I was very excited to learn that there was a best of cd/dvd compination available.  I have been into the group from the very beginning, but unfortunately, had never seen many of their videos.  Thanks MTV.  Anyway, I ordered Rewind-The Best of 95-87 to catch up on all the videos that I had never seen.  I received the disc and promptly placed it into my dvd player (Panasonic).  It would not play the disc, "unable to read format".  OK, I tried my second dvd/vcr combo, it will play anything.....no, not this time.  "Format: Unrecognizable".  I tried the disc on three other players (Samsung, Hitachi, and a portable Sony), all to no avail.  I finally placed it in my iMac, my last hope.  It said that it would not read as a dvd, but it could play it in another format.  Meaning, it will play the disc, but as a computer image, not as a true dvd.  The picture was very small and quite grainy.  So I still got to see the videos, but not in the format that I had hoped.  I just wanted to pass this information on to other fans of the band.  It is a risky purchase, and a pricey one at that+music
"Try This" - Please Do Not Try This!+N+I used to be a big Pink's fan. I loved her first CD. It was the only CD I listened to for 5 months straight. Then, her second CD came out. It was a big disappointment. Something in her style changed, which I did not like. But I still faithfully purchased this CD, hoping that she would put out some good music. But I seriously regretted buying the CD.   I guess now Pink is famous, she gets to decide what direction she wants her music to go. Obviously, she is always been a punk rock chic deep down inside. Now I realized that the style in her first CD wasn't really who she was. It was just something that her record company put her in so that she could be accepted by the general mass. Now Pink has millsions of faithful fans, she can care less about being accpeted. She takes off her mask and we see this rocker girl. Some people love her more, some people like her less. I belong to the latter group.   The music in this CD is mostly rock with a little bit pop beat. If that's what you like, buy this CD.   Purple_Garde+music
Better than...+P+Whut? Thee Album was better than any Solo effort from E-double. It hurts me to admit that becuase I am a huge fan of erick sermon, but I have to say it. I consider Reggie on the TOP TEN LIST. He (in my opinion) is one of Hip Hops Finest Lyricists!!! Everything about this record was good. His creativitly & humor, hardcore raps, etc. You all really should include this in your next purchase. High Quality Hip Hop Material, NO FILLER what-so-ever. A+music
Save Your Money+N+The songs were cut to pieces to fit them on the CD.  Don't bother, the great stuff was just ruined+music
Music to drink codeine cough syrup by.+P+Richard Cheese and Lounge Against the Machine have done the obvious, obviously. While not strictly as bad as William (Bill) Murry's obnoxious lounge act, nor as over-the-top as the late Andy Kaufman's Tony Clifton persona, `Richard Cheese' keeps his performance within the character's velvet rope guidelines, and instead minimizes and only slightly deconstructs the classic lounge song. This is neither Sinatra nor Bennet, nor is it your little brother doing a bad imitation of them. This is serious lounge, yet alternative. Like waking from a familiar dream, Richard Cheese's renditions are still recognizable, yet obviously something "other", and yet as pure as the originals.  Richard Cheese and Lounge Against The Machine, therefore, are not tribute creators in another style, like Dred Zepplin, for they are members of their genre. They also are not a joke on the genre within the genre, as was the lamented "Nig Heist" within the touring "Black Flag" shows of the early 80s. Neither do they make `lounge' more `lounge' with overproduction, digital techniques, and rich strings. Indeed, minimalism and limited range are the bywords. Or perhaps it is driven by a small production budget.  And the obvious question must be answered: is Richard Cheese "Cheesy?" Only in the sophomoric dimensions of a joke as obvious as a goiter, where we cry out "Dick Cheese!" in the same breath that we call "Mike Hunt!" over a smoky crowd of strapless cocktail dresses, and elicit a few titters. Cheesy, yes, but the music does compel repeated listening, like Alex Chilton covering "More" with Bobby Darrin's shade speaking through the whisky, there is something there, there.   But Richard Cheese and Lounge Against the Machine are not cocktail classics to spin when you have the smoking jacket on and the new recruits from the secretary pool dropping by your place after the show, for this lounge set speaks more to the `cocktails made with codeine' set of cool.  And yes, I am dying to know what Sir-Mix-A-Lot thinks of this version of "Baby Got Back.+music
The Best Slack Key Collection?+P+It could be. I have a pretty extensive collection of slack key CDs, and this is my favorite. Without it, I may have never heard Ozzie Kotani or Moses Kahumoku. It's beautifully recorded, the liner notes are well written, plus they give all the tunings+music
Testify.+P+Toward the end there is some weaker filler-type material, but for the most part this CD contains all the soul you'd ever need or want. &quot;Hold On I'm-a-Comin'&quot; is perhaps the greatest single soul statement out there, and there are a half-dozen other essential tracks contained on this disc. My favorite: &quot;I Can't Stand Up for Falling Down,&quot; the ultimate picture of a man beaten who wishes to rise up again... but cannot. This is, of course, a love song. What isn't+music
Excellent children's intro to Spanish+P+This is a standard play in our home.   My kids LOVE the way the character's repeat each Spanish sentence after Luis, Bob, Maria and the Muppets.  The songs are catchy and infectious.   We love to listen to this one in the afternoon, and after a lively session of sing along and dancing, it's off for naptime!  Buy the video too, it's fun and festive and will give your little ones a taste of Spanish culture.   A must have for every Elmo and Sesame Street fan+music
melanie c rocks+N+she has made a good albums and this one wasnt that better  than emmas albums or victorias.shes my favorite spice but after the 90s is started to like all of them really.she was nice and brave i dont know as shes doing now tho without the spice girls beacuase when shed perform with them shed bring the word spice into spice girls. there is alot of rock music in this album too! it would make a reat spice girls collection or melanie c fan collection so buy it!+music
Beautiful+P+this cd is wondeful. some of his best work. if you are a fan, this is a must buy+music
Watch out!+N+Be aware that this CD is INSTRUMENTAL ONLY! If you are looking for traditional hymns, this is the &quot;lite&quot; version. Sounds like muzak+music
Hope you like instrumentals!+N+I bought this album expecting songs to sing with the kids. The music is probably great, but I have not yet gotten past the disappointment of so few sing alongs+music
The start of something good+P+This is Trisha Yearwood's self titled debut album. The album was produced by Garth Fundis, who she has worked with many times. There's a collaboration with Garth Brooks, top songwriters, what more do you need? Yearwood is one of my favorite female country singers, because she sings better than most of her peers. Her voice is very good at emoting, she can go from a whisper to a scream in a second FLAT. She really makes you feel what she is singing. There was some big hits from this album including the classic &quot;She's In Love With The Boy&quot;, the ballad &quot;The Woman Before Me&quot;, the uptempo &quot;That's What I Like About You&quot; and the ballad with Garth Brooks singing backup titled &quot;Like We Never Had A Broken Heart&quot;. Other highlights include &quot;The Whisper Of Your Heart&quot;, &quot;Fools Like Me&quot; and &quot;Victim Of The Game&quot;. Overall a strong debut+music
save your money+N+I am a fan of modest mouse at least most of there stuff I didn't like long drive loved moon and antartic and thought lonesome crowded west was good this one however has only one good song to offer the fruit that ate itself is a great song well worth downloading better than any song on long drive or lonesome crowded west but the rest of the cd is garbage so save your money and download that one song+music
BOOOOOOOOO+N+This CD stinks. It's got the worst music. The only good song is &quot;This is How We Do It&quot;.Don't buy it+music
A terrible waste of money+N+I bought this album thinking it would be good, because every review I read gave it 5 stars. SO I thought "Why not?" and bought it. I put it in the cd player, and was immediately dissapointed. The first thing I noticed was how terrible the sound levels were. It sounds like it was recorded in my garage, everything is way over-saturated and the drums are mic'd terribly. You can't even tell what's going on half the time, which isn't saying much, because there is nothing very interesting happening in the guitars. So I listened a little longer, thinking "it has to get better, maybe they'll add some symphonic stuff or something, considering this was reviewed to be some sort of black metal masterpiece." I was wrong of course, as the first track remained pretty stagnant, as did the next, and the next track etc. assumed that the frontman MUST be a good singer, considering his howl is absolutely laughable. Once again, bad sound levels come in to play here, even though not a whole lot could cover up how terrible this dude is.  Basically this album is not the black metal masterpiece it was hyped up to be. If you are into really bad prog metal with bad production, this album is for you. If you're not, steer clear of this album. it was the biggest waste of money I made this year+music
Powerful and expressive singing with an amazing technique and control+P+Considering Netrebko's and Villazon's age- both are in their thirties- the maturity and command of their artistry is constantly moving ahead of their years. Villazon, with all the bells and whistles of his top ringing notes, has becomes the spinto/Italianate tenor extraordinaire of our time that gives us glimpses- although I hate to make comparisons- of Correlli and Di Stefano. Netrebko, as a soprano, is in a league of her own. Her voice in any new recording sounds better than in her last one. The lyricim, color and communicating power of her singing trancends vulnerability, despair and hopelessness that are so well portayed in Mimi's duet. Some bloggers hate Netrebko's guts and claim hype for her success. That's a cop out. You cannot sell out opera houses all over the world, and CDs that have surpassed in numbers many classical recording of the past, based only on hype. There must be a substantive voice behind a beautiful face and body. I love and I know opera well, and I've seen, live, many of the great sopranos of past forty years. And if I'm flying across the U.S.A. to see Netrebko at her Carnegie Hall debut- I was lucky to find one of the last tickets- is not hype. No body fooled me and no body made me do it.  For some, the jury may be still out for these two opera superstars, but this CD is an example of extraordinary singing and is highly recommended.   Constantine A. Papas  El Paso, Texa+music
great choice!+P+There are so many different songs to choose from on this cd and it's a great buy. whether you want to play it while eating dinner at the wedding, to walking down the isle, it's wonderful!!!+music
Brillant recording+P+The thing about ''Evita'' is that it is such a remarkable musical that the different interpretations are each worthy of owning and enjoying, much like listening to different interpretations of Bach or Mozart.  The largest negative about this recording is that it's incomplete (which is hardly a negative:  ''The worst thing about the London Cast recording is that there isn't more...'').  Elaine Paige is stunning, and her performance alone is worth the money.  Her vocal range, power, emotion, and expression are awe-inspiring, and the recording seems tailored to complement her performance.  The orchestration is light and subtle, most likely to show off the powerful vocals.  David Essex as ''Che'' continues to grow on me (my first impression were not all that favorable) and Joss Ackland is superb.  The more I listen to this recording, the more it becomes my overall favorite by far.  The Broadway Cast double album is essential if you want the complete musical and to understand the story, and the production is marked by full orchestration and very large cast.  The concept album has its pluses and unique characteristics, but in terms of overall performance I feel the London cast does a better job vocally (especially Elaine) and the Broadway cast is a fuller production.  I would probably recommend the Broadway album as a first choice, simply to get the full musical and to listen to a very large production of this incredible work.  However, for subtlety, grace, and outstanding performances, the London Cast highlight album stands ahead of all the rest+music
YAWN - WHY BOTHER?+N+UNLIKE VOLUME 1, WHICH WAS GREAT (IF INCOMPLETE), VOLUME 2 ALWAYS LEFT ME SHAKING MY HEAD. WHILE IT HAS SERPENTINE FIRE (WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON VOLUME 1) AND A FEW OTHER HITS, MOST OF THIS ALBUM IS FILLER (FANTASY AGAIN?). WHAT'S MY POINT? MY POINT IS THAT FOR A COUPLE OF BUCKS MORE YOU CAN GET ALL OF THE ORIGINAL VOLUME 1, THE GOOD STUFF OFF OF VOLUME 2 (MINUS THE FILLER), AND GET IT ALL ON ONE DISC (EWF's GREATEST HITS). I'M JUST HERE TO HELP YOU DO THE RIGHT THING+music
Best of best!+P+Listen to Havona! With Jaco on the bass, probably one of his artworks of life! Truely inspiring and magnificent for any bassist who's into funk, fusion, and jazz+music
Mediocre for Benoit+N+I have been a DB fan for a while but simply found nothing new in his latest effort. The beginning is basically the same as "Fuzzy Logic" and "Right Here, Right Now", and the whole CD's format is just too predictable and less jazzy than before. He's probably trying to be a bit Brizilian but just not quite there... Not impressive at all!+music
worms+N+I love Porcupine Tree, Marillion, Blackfield......but I find nothing illuminating about this album. I want my money back. This is very average at best. You should buy something else+music
FANTASTIC!+P+I saw Leahy in concert at Milwaukee's Irish Cultural Center.  The experience is beyond words.  We were clapping, yelling, and dancing in our seats!  That prompted me to buy their first album and I was not disappointed.  The musicianship is terrific and the selection unbeatable.  I've listened to it many, many times and it never grows old.  Thanks Leahy!+music
THE BEGINNING OF THE END+P+I have been an AC/DC fan for more than 20 years now. I have all the albums. And looking back, it seems like this was the last solid one they made.  This one is not nearly as good as BACK IN BLACK, or even HIGHWAY TO HELL. No, at this point the band was not working as hard to crank out good material. I'm thinking that is why producer Mutt Lange bowed out after this record. He did the previous 2 records, and every song on those was great. Here, "Snowballed," "Inject the venom," and others are clearly filler material. That is too bad, too, because Brian Johnson still had a voice on this record. If you have heard him sing anytime since 1986 he sounds hoarse.  If you want to hear the Young brothers at their best, get POWERAGE, HIGHWAY TO HELL, and BACK IN BLACK. Every AC/DC record since then falls short of those.+music
I cannot describe the techniques of this new Flamenco guitar+P+All tracks are wonderful and well composed; I think Behzad is one of those fantastic Flamenco guitar players. I agree that this brilliant album needs reengineering and could take the first place in the world of modern Flamenco guitar instrumental album+music
Primative Blues+P+There is something strange and primative about the beats laid down by Kimbrough and his band.  A view into what the blues may have sounded like 50 years ago, but amp'ed up. It's tough to pull yourself away from this sound. Liner notes by Robert Palmer are also great. If you are looking for soemthing different, but great, check out this album+music
No wonder he teamed up with Billy Joel for tours+N+Judging by both of their collections of "hits", the two of them produced some of the most annoying tunes of the 70s & 80s, and unfortunately, beyond. These two "pretend" rockers hit the radio with junk like "Crocodile Rock" (John) and "Uptown Girl" (Joel), thus cementing their respective geek reputations. Yuck! Neither Elton John nor Billy Joel have made anything authentic; they are both fake rock and rollers with repertoires filled with lame tunes, making them like the male equivalents of Gloria Estefan or Madonna. Yuck! Zero stars+music
Silky Smoothy Selections!+P+Happy Days are here again with the release of a greatest hits album by 90's mega group Silk.  If you were a true R&B fan in the 90s then you were a fan of Silk's music. They had countless hits in their collection, and The Best of Silk highlights practically all of them.  If you include the opening interlude, there are SIX tracks from their first album Lose Control on this greatest hits disc.  They are the opening "Interlude," "Happy Days," "Freak Me," "Lose Control," "Girl U For Me," and "It Had To Be You."  They also include two remixes of "Happy Days" and "Freak Me" at the end of the disc.  Songs from their self-titled second album include "I Can Go Deep" (which was also from A Low Down Dirty Shame Soundtrack), "Hooked On You," and "Don't Rush."  Songs from Tonight consist of "Let's Make Love," "If You (Lovin' Me)," "The Return," and "Meeting In My Bedroom."  "We're Callin' You" is the only song from their last album Love Session with all the original crew.  Thankfully they didn't include anything from their independent album that was released minus Little G.  All in all, this was a good package of solid hits.  You should definitely add The Best of Silk to the collection if you don't already own the original albums+music
Third In A Five Star Series+P+The rushing, lush &quot;Love Song&quot; by Ronan Hardiman opens this set with gorgeous vocals and Celtic influences over pop beats.  &quot;Rushing&quot; by Moby is a laid-back groove with simple piano  melodies on top.  A sensuous female vocal is the centerpiece of  Balligomingo's &quot;Lost&quot;, and the multi-layered instrumentation over  a dance beat make this a prime cut off this CD.  Thomas Newman's  &quot;Lunch With The King&quot; is taken from the &quot;American  Beauty&quot; soundtrack, and fits the scene it was taken from perfectly.   It's a differently-themed piece.  Pilgramage's &quot;Through The Seas Of  Life&quot; has some beautiful religious-themed vocals running through this  up-tempo groove.  Electronically cut together vocals detract from the pure  danceability of Govinda's &quot;Aspetta&quot;, especially with a lively  fiddle melody that weaves in and out.  &quot;The Garden&quot; by Faithless  is a musical soundscape that combines new age, electronica and pop to  create a danceable groove yet retain the new age feel.  The jazzy  &quot;Blue Skies&quot; by Soma Sonic is very trip-hop like, and includes  high ethereal female vocals occasionally layered on top.  Ikarus'  &quot;Bassment&quot; almost sounds like a Fatboy Slim record with male  chanting on top.  This track isn't one of the better ones.  &quot;Peaceful  Village&quot; brings Japanese influences to new-age pop by way of Yasue,  and does it well.  A deep groove with vocals that weave in and out in a  jazzy way is the trademark of Phobos' &quot;Soul Of Desire&quot;, a simply  beautiful relaxing track.  The Sprit Of Eden and Davy Spillane team up on  &quot;The Sun And The Moon And The Stars&quot;, another track with an  electronic beat and heavy Celtic influences.  Lovely to listen to on a  windy day.  Dagda is electronic trance music with Celtic melodies on top,  and while similar things have been done before, they do it very well.   Their track, &quot;Shades of The Otherworld&quot; stands out here and Dagda  should be a group to watch.  Clair Marlo's &quot;Celtic Groove&quot; is  exactly what it says it is, and it is also done very well.  Another artist  to watch.  Alkaemy's &quot;Enchantment&quot; ends this disc, and does so in  a laid-back fashion.  A very subdued beat with Celtic mystic influences  make this a beautiful closer for the CD.  Yet another winner for Elevation+music
Wonderful Spiritual Music from Colombia+P+Like many Colombians, I've known about Carlos Vives from his days of Clasicos de la Provincia in 1993. Vives takes provincial music from Colombia (vallenato and cumbia, among numerous others) and infuses them with a spirituality and depth that makes the music all the more worthy. El Amore De Mi Tierra is no different. Vives pulls from various fountains of Colombian music and turns them into flowing, rhythmic world music that is accessable to all peoples. The collection here is very good. While &quot;Fruta Fresca&quot; is the track that most people are familiar with, &quot;La Piragua&quot; is definately the best track on the album. An update of a classic Colombian cumbia song, Vives's take on &quot;La Piragua&quot; turns the song into a lush fable full of earthy melodies and a spirit of the Amazon without forskaing the song's musical roots. For those who are new to Carlos Vives, this album is a great place to start+music
Mostly a dud, unfortunately...+N+Disney, in my opinion, dropped the ball for the third installment of the disney classics CDs (which is probably why you only see 1 and 2 advertised on TV). The only tracks really worth it are "I'll Try" (although I have no idea what that is from) and "He lives in you". Other than that, most of the tracks are boring and no up to the level most of the others are. I would not suggest purchasing this cd+music
Weird, funny, dark, strangely funky - Tom Waits strikes again +P+I've barely even scratched the surface of Tom Waits' music, but from the three albums of his I've been lucky enough to hear, I know that the man is truly an original in the musical world.  There is some Dylan, some Beefheart, some Nick Cave in there - but not really, because Tom Waits can never be mistaken for anybody else.  He's a primitivist in the truest sense of the word - his musical and lyrical voice evokes an ancient wisdom with its jarring and primal diametrical phrases that cut straight to the bone.  When we hear "Earth Died Screaming," we know that Waits is serious, and his vision of the apocalypse is drenched in the biblical imagery of sickness and decay.  Fellow dark prince Nick Cave may know the lingo, but ultimately he is an historian who can cleverly reference ancient literature and religion, whereas Tom Waits has the voice of an ancient prophet.  That may explain why his status as a pop-culture icon is sort of a "hobo guru." There's something genuinely mystical about him.    "Bone Machine," Tom Waits' blisteringly weird little epic of clangs, twangs, and grumbles, was a powerful way for the master to enter his third decade of recording.  Some of it seems a bit disorganized, and some of the songs are out of place being on this album (and those are kind of a part of what makes Tom Waits' albums so cool), but there's no such thing as a throwaway here.  The melodies are strong, the lyrics are fantastic, the themes are steady and powerful, and the presentation is truly unique; the grotesque, sometimes bone-chilling percussive clangs of Waits 'bones' players are sounds that have rarely been heard before on a rock record.  It's an aggressively experimental approach that manages to avoid sounding elitist at all - in fact, I'd say that in a totally whacked way, this is kind of accessible. Who can say that "Murder in the Red Barn" isn't catchy?  It's a great little story-song with a Chaucerian barnyard allegory of man's violent nature, cycling around and around the "murder in the red barn" chorus with the bones bong-bonging away and sharp twangs of the steel-stringed guitar. "I don't wanna grow up" is avant-garde balladry, if there is such a thing - there's a static scratch in the background and Waits growls more painfully than ever, but he strums the chords and delivers his cry of fear against the wickedness of adulthood in such a heartfelt way that it's become the most popular song on the album.  It's the same twisted logic that makes this such a fun listen.  It's diverse, brave, gruesomely funny, strange, and unforgettable.  "Earth Died Screaming," "Dirt in the Ground," "Black Wings," "Goin out West," "In the Colosseum," and "Such a Scream" are other standout tracks.                +music
Kinda (...) Bad+N+(...)This CD is sub-par.  Most of the beats are cool, but they're overlayed with too many cheesy lyrics+music
Falls Flat+N+I just saw GYPSY and the well-known actress, Patti LuPone, playing and singing Mama Rose was superb.  Her voice was a miracle of covering all the emotional turmoil that is Rose.  She soared from sexy to demented to determined to clever.  I came home and put on Midler's Gypsy, and it sounded flat, stale, weary, unprofitable.  I have always liked Bette Midler, but this CD seems to have no dynamic, no sparkle.  I think that you need a true Broadway diva to sing Rose, and perhaps even one with some operatic experience.  I can only fervantly pray that the Ravinia Festival will release a DVD or a CD of the LuPone production.  It may be unfair to compare Roses.  Midler does excel in different material but I don't think that she was able to find the turmoil that is Madame Rose and to sing it+music
Five Star Album, Two Star DVD-A Mixing+N+Can't say enough about this album. I got it as traditional CD several months ago, and it is, by far, the best music I've bought all year. Due the sparse selection of DVD-A, I was thrilled to see it offered here in this format. The positive reviews on the mix were even more encouraging. I've got a dedicated DVD-Audio player run through a Pioneer 135 watts per channel amp running Klipsh KG 5.5 mains and comperable center, surrounds and sub. -Not a totally high-end system, but it'll hold its own.  I have to say that I was disapointed when I heard the album for one reason: Knopfler's voice is 95% relegated to the center channel. Perhaps it's a matter of taste, but there is way too much separation between voice and instuments. The idea of 5 channel separation is a wonderful thing when done right -any Donald Fagen, Hotel California, but there's a fine line in the mixing between perfection and annoying. In my opinion, this one crosses that line. Some may love it; to me, it's unbalanced and makes for a frustrating listening experience.  -Bria+music
Great collection+P+I still have the tape of this album.  The record was released in 1986, NGDB's twentieth anniversary, and it includes a lot of their best songs, including three of my favorites, &quot;Mr. Bojangles&quot;, &quot;Ripplin'  Waters&quot;, and &quot;Partners, Brothers And Friends&quot;.  The one song  on this album that hadn't been previously released, &quot;Stand A Little  Rain&quot;, is also excellent.  Bob Carpenter hardly ever sings lead on an  NGDB song, but on &quot;Stand A Little Rain&quot;, he does a fine job of  singing.  The reason I didn't give this record a higher rating is because  one song on the album, &quot;Fire In The Sky&quot;, doesn't sound country  enough, in my opinion.  True, the Dirt Band had a lot of pop, as well as  country and folk, influences.  However, I think &quot;Fire In The  Sky&quot;, on which Jeff Hanna shares the lead vocals with Kenny Loggins,  veers a little too far in the pop direction with its saxophone, although  the arrangement is excellent.  Nevertheless, that's a small shortcoming  here.  Overall, Twenty Years of Dirt is a great collection.  NGDB fans  should have this one+music
Journey no longer knows how to rock on this atrocious album+N+I've never had this album, never thought about getting this album, and never would touch this album with a ten foot pole. Journey by this time in their career, decided that they didn't want to rock out anymore. This is just saccharin sweet pop music for teenage girls. Like a previous reviewer said, this sounds like a Steve Perry album with the Journey name on it. I thought they were starting a decline with the release of ESCAPE, but even back then they could actually rock on occasion. These mostly are just syrupy ballads or just weak songs in general. Steve Perry was the shot in the arm that Journey needed back in 1978, but with this release he's kind of in charge of the downfall, also. If you like to rock out, this ain't the album to get, so basically take my advice and stay far away from RAISED ON RADIO+music
The Killer's Greatest Album of the 70's+P+After making a well-deserved comeback as a solid country artist in the late 60's, Jerry Lee Lewis went to England in 1973 and recorded this great album that was a welcome return to his rock n' roll roots. Lewis recorded some good albums throughout the 70's, but most of them were aimed primarily at the country music market. This is pure rock n' roll all the way, with a couple of old blues tunes thrown in the mix as well.   The London Sessions sounds like one big jam session with Jerry Lee Lewis in his prime, pounding his way through a selection of great classic tunes like Johnny B. Goode, What'd I say, Movin' on down the line, No Headstone on my grave, and Baby what you want me to do. The studio band of top British musicians lay down some strong backing to Jerry Lee's great piano playing and singing, and the spontaneous, live in the studio feel of this album is an approach that brings out the best in Jerry Lee.  Highlights include a rockin' version of Johnny B. Goode, a superior remake of his old Sun recording Drinkin' Wine spo-dee-o-dee that kicks off the album, and a truly dynamic medley of Little Richard hits that ends it. It is great to see that this has been remastered on CD since this is probably Jerry Lee's most vibrant album and surely one of the best rock n' roll albums of 1973. Any lover of classic rock needs to get their hands on this CD. This is simply the best set of rock n' roll the Killer has recorded since his classic Sun recordings+music
Screetchy and annoying--&quot;ironic&quot; in an Alanis Morisette way+N+I was expecting something closer to a good voice, or at least someone attempting the lyric genius of Ani DiFranco. Both Tracy Bonham's screetchy and frequently flat delivery and her inarticulate message were off-putting. For some great women rockers who manage to preserve musical beauty along with their political and personal messages, check out any of the following: Tracy Chapman, Ani DiFranco (even in her most angry politically-charged work she maintains lyrical beauty and ocassionally musical loveliness), The Indigo Girls, Sarah McLaughlan, Bonnie Raitt (especially her early Blues-revival period), Paula Cole+music
VERRY GOOD !!!!!+P+THIS ALBUM IS A CLASSIC.I HAD TO MUCH TO DREAM LAST NIGHT IS GREAT AND GET ME O THE WORLD ON TIME IS TO.IF YOU LIKE  PSYCHEDELIC MUSIC I WOULD GET IT+music
Wings of Gold+P+Song number four, Ali d'oro (wings of gold) is a heart-stopper.  Wow.  John Lee Hooker and Zucchero (singing like Clapton on a really good day): "I lay down with an angel, lay down thinking, more than I could, really say"  Damn, this is what music is about+music
incredible bluegrass+P+This is a fantastic cd, and track #4 is an incredible piece of music.  Particularly for bluegrass fans, and cloggers.  It's become my favorite bluegrass cd+music
Best New Release - 2006+P+Another gem from AHC, diva.  It's no wonder she's won NYC's own "American Idol for the Pros" (the MAC Award) an astonishing 14 times!  Miss Callaway's recently released "Blues in the Night" gifts listeners with an impressive range of songs encompassing depth and breadth of the human experience. She has, to say the Least, mastered vocal performance.  Her magnificent vocal quality, interpretations, phrasing, intonation, time and choices are always spot on.  Her range is, as the youngsters say, sick.  Just a few of the highlights of this project are Cole Porter's "It's All Right With Me," Stephen Sondheim's "No One Is Alone," as well as several new AHC originals!  And, the hauntingly beautiful "Spring Can Really Hang You Up the Most." The title cut gives those of us who didn't get to see her Tony-nominated performance in "Swing" a chance to dig "Blues in the Night" over and over again.  And speaking of Broadway...the duet here with sister, Broadway favorite Liz Callaway, rates a Bravo-Standing-Ovation after each listening.  This CD recharges the soul's spirit, so often chipped away by day-to-day challenges and, of course, the blues+music
All I can say is: Why?+N+Why did they have to produce this album.  From start to finish all the tracks blend to white noise in my ear.  This was a severe disappointment.  Even more disappointing then Eve.  At least Eve had some tracks that you could 'aquire a taste' for not so with On Air.  If you're a collector buy it as cheaply as you can and let it gather dust otherwise don't waste your time and money there are many more memorable cd's out there.  I, unfortunately, own the cd and have listened to it many times and I can't even begin to tell you what one single lyric is on the album.  That is if there are any. +music
Time to retire+N+I can't believe this band is still together because their music was never any good to begin with.  I know so many friends who are such huge fans of this band and I can't figure out why anybody would want to listen to these guys because their music is so dull.  Motley Crue is the kind of band where you can just take their record and just throw it in the garbage.  The only reason why these guys got back together is because they needed the quick cash to pay off their debts.  To their credit, at least they still have some fans left who will pay top dollar to see them perform live+music
Compare this to Stand Up...+P+Compare the two albums by Dave that get the most negative reviews, and it's like heaven and hell. This is a mfing amazing album next to Stand Up. I really don't understand the disillusionment by all these Dave Matthews fans over this CD. There are some pure golden songs on it, and like any other album, there are some not so great ones, but this at least still SOUNDS like DMB. I never had any doubts about this CD until I started reading such negative reviews. I went back and listened a little more critically, and I still stand my initial impression. Not his strongest, but still an acceptable album+music
Whitechocolatespaceegg allows Pahir to develop+P+WCSE is perhaps Liz's most mature record both song writing & musically....the title track is both erie & sad, & I think the standout track is "What Makes You Happy" which is very upbeat & almost dancable!  This is a great record if you like good songwriting & great structure to your pop/rock music+music
Very Satisfying+P+With so many tracks, spanning both the first and second seasons of the NEW Doctor Who series, this American listener found this soundtrack very satisfying, because it captures all those highlights and moods I loved so much from the show. All those little songs moments that you wished you could hear more of. I highly recommend it for anyone that enjoyed the show+music
hopeless but cutesy+N+This was a very important record to young nerds who bought the NME and Melody Maker back in the day. This is supposed to be some sort of subversive stylistic endeavour, and maybe it is compared to your parents Supertramp records, but it's really about how cute young Jim looked in his black outfit. I trudged along in my black outfit to see them when they toured Oz in the early nineties and they did their bit by being hopeless musicians (like all touring English bands of the time, such as MBV) and storming off like spoilt brats after 30 minutes or so. It was a hell of a lot of fun I suppose, but not any more about making interesting music than Supertramp, for instance+music
STD RULES!+P+STD as in this album that is.  It was a key decision to have Joey come into play on vocals for the band.  His first album with Anthrax simply owns you.  He has a really awesome vocal range and it always seems to captivate me in every song.  He reminds me of Bruce Dickinson.  I certainly agree with a previous reviewer that this album is superior to the highly accredited 'Among the Living' (which does rule as well).  Now I'll try and give a rundown of the tracks:  A.I.R. 10/10 -  This song title starts Anthrax's acronym song titles.  Has a killer riff used throughout most of the song.    Lone Justice 10/10 - This song is awesome since it reminds me of another awesome Anthrax track, "I Am the Law" regarding the lyrical theme, however, I actually like this one better.  Has sweet bass lines that stand out.  Madhouse 9/10 - Has a funny intro with a patient's maniacal laughing.  Always reminds me of "Welcome Home" (Sanitarium)  Please tell me you know that song, although it's much more upbeat.   S.C.C./Stand or Fall - 10/10 A thrashing motivational number we have here.  Anthrax continues to bring forth stellar musicianship and energy.  Very anthemic.    The Enemy - 20/10 I don't know why but I really love this song here.  This song definitely needs more praise from everyone.  The backup vocals singing "SCREAMS IN THE NIGHT" is awesome.  I think this song is about Hitler perhaps?    Aftershock 9/10 Probably my least fave on the album, not sure why since it does rock pretty hard...hmmm.  Oh yeah I does have a really cool solo in it at least.  Armed and Dangerous 10/10 Really nice, shall I say relaxing beginning to it then like most thrash songs that start slow, goes into high gear soon after.  I also noticed this has some really sick drumming in it too.  Medusa 11/10  REALLY cool song.  "Medusaaaa! She's starin' at you!!"  Undeniable goodness here.  Gung-Ho 10/10  Mighty fine closer we have here.  Anthrax still maintain the consistency of high energy that was with us the whole album and certainly doesn't slow down.  If anything, it gets even faster.  The beginning kinda sounds like a Slayer song in a way, that's what I think at least.    If you call yourself a metalhead, you need to pick up this masterpiece along with Among the Living, Persistence of Time, and State of Euphoria.  You just have to give props to the underrated band of the Big 4 of Thrash since they were just as talented as the others.   +music
Incomplete Soundtrack+N+It would be nice, as a couple of other reviewers stated, to have included some of the "score" as well as the songs and arrangements already present.  I was hoping their would be a bit of that when I ordered it.  The songs are good but didn't warrant listening to the CD more than a couple of times+music
Not my first choice+N+Johnny Rotten must have been upset with his record company when he recorded this effort. The production is sloppy and there doesn't appear to be any attempts at song construction. It's simply Jah Wobble wobbling along while Rotten moans and rants unintelligibly.  It wouldn't surprise me if all the tracks were recorded in one take and in one day.  Blah blah blah  PIL's first album is much better+music
Let's make this clear...+P+the average number of stars should be &quot;5&quot;+music
My ears, oh no, my ears!+N+This presentation of Mr. Boone's deserves a 1 for effort, a 5 for the best bad thing I've ever heard.  He made of mess of Little Richard's "Tutti Fruitti" way back when.  So, in keeping with such destruction, he went after our precious metal hits.  Funny stuff, though.  I keep thinking of the those sad off the strip casino bands trying to entertain folks who just want a $1.99 breakfast and a win at the nickel machines. +music
Great 1st album, too bad about him though...+P+The D.O.C. could have rivaled the greatest MCs alive like Rakim, Chuck D, and Ice Cube.  But his vocal chords were tragically destroyed in a car accident after he released this CD.  This cd is very good.  It is one of the few albums you can listen to from track 1 to the end.  Of course these days it's basically impossible to find one.  The beats are great, and the lyrics are clever, although sometimes i feel they could have been better.  His harsh sounding voice has a nice feel, and although he did release more albums after this one that were lyrically better than this, his (lack of a) voice kind of killed them.  Dre's production is sick.  Overall this one's a 4.5/5.  1. It's Funky Enough      -Beat: 5      -Lyrics: 4      -Overall: 4.5 Sick beat on a classic first track.  2. Mind Blowin'       -Beat: 4.5      -Lyrics: 4      -Overall: 4.5  3. Lend me an Ear      -Beat: 5      -Lyrics: 4.5      -Overall: 4.5 A very hot fast rap by D.O.C.  4. Comm. Blues A break  5. Let The Bass Go      -Beats: 5      -Lyrics:4.5      -Overall: 5 Great song with a nice bass.  6. Beautiful but Deadly      -Beats/guitar: 5      -Lyrics: 5      -Overall: 5 My second favorite joint on the cd.  Some great guitar solos.  Rapping on top of a guitar is a very nice touch.  Love it.  7. The D.O.C. & The Doctor      -Beats: 5      -Lyrics: 5      -Overall: 5 One of the (many) classics on the cd.  8. No One Can Do It Better      -Beats: 5      -Lyrics: 5      -Overall: 5 The title says it all...  9. Whirlwind Pyramid, 9.5/10       -Beats: 5      -Lyrics: 5      -Overall: 5 Great great great...  10. Comm. 2 Another break  11. The Formula      -Beats: 5      -Lyrics: 5      -Overall: 5 amazing song.  12. Portrait Of a Master Piece      -Beats: 4.5      -Lyrics: 4      -Overall: 4 Very good faster rapping by the DOC.  13. The Grande Finale      -Beats: 5      -Lyrics: 5      -Overall: 5 My favorite track.  It features NWA, with raps by ice cube, ren, and eazy.  I loved the NWA stuff more than the individual joints by all of them, so throwing the doc into it is like heaven for me.  overall i say this album is a must have for anyone who's into the birth of hardcore/gangsta rap from the Golden Age+music
Movin Melodies-&lt;~>-ATB what a genious+P+I have to give ATB hard props on this album!!!  This is one of most listened to cds ever.  If you are into DEEP Chiller trance  this has got to be a must for every techno, trance, and elektronica lover out there!!+music
FELL OFF+N+For as long as i can remember i have been a fan of Krs-one/B.D.P. and I have to say that this is the worst album i have heard by him. Sound wise most of these tracks sound pretty commercial and could easily be heard on the radio. Lyrically the "Teacher" that we all know and love has fallen off to a point that he may never be able to recover I mean the lyrics are downright terrible. This is a sad day for hip hop fans every where. Their is not a single song on this album that is even close to enjoyable. Lets hope that in the futre Krs can get it together and release another banger. but for now I think ill stick with SNEAK ATTACK the last truly great lyrical album   +music
weak, repetitive+N+I am a big fan of Thomas Newman. This is just too much the same on every track, unless you like the Balkan dirge(s) for variety+music
A wonderful album+P+This album is filled with very emotive and original music.  My favorites are "Marguerite," "Canyon Song," and "Sail."  Oregon's music is complex both rhythmically and harmonically: rhythm-wise, there is a 7/8 improvisation section in "Canyon Song," harmonically most of the tracks feature clearly jazz-level chords.  As a fincancially stingy person, even I have no regrets about buying this album.  Highly recommended for people interested in the art of music+music
Why?+N+As other reviewers have pointed out.....why??? This compilation does nobody a service - it cheats longtime fans who have already purchased this material countless times in the past (although thankfully there isn't anything unreleased here to force them to purchase it) - and it is an unhelpful starting point for novices who are curious about Joni's brilliant catalogue. If you want to get started with Joni, buy ANY of her albums up to Court and Spark. All of these are brilliant and accessible enough to make you investigate further. At least her recent Beginning of Survival compilation had a theme - it provided a consise representation of her Geffen output so that fans who aren't too devoted didn't need to fork out for the Geffen Complete Works box set (although, it has to be said that the Geffen stuff is complete dreck). This collection has no such unifying theme, other than the fact that these tracks were all selected by Joni herself.   Big Deal.   Seeing as she now refers to her Geffen output as the most significant of her career, it's quite clear that she isn't the best judge of her own music these days. Avoid this and just work your way through her classic albums. You'll be glad you did+music
a very good cd+P+I am a big Leann Rimes fan and i have every cd that she has out. i think this is an awsome cd. Everyone should go out and get it.+music
A great compilation of original work+P+Blah blah blah - just go buy it+music
Agnetha at her worst+N+Okay. Agnetha's first album was number one in UK or whatever, but I think that this is just another Abba album ...I love the catchy song: I Can't Shake Loose (No 65 UK), Wrap Your Arms Around Me (No 45 UK), Man, and Take Good Care of Yor Children. After this album, Agnetha produced some better work which were never released as a single in UK. A very disapointing album, and it was recorded with an excellent producer-engineer too quickly (from the first recording to the release was 5 months!)+music
Like The Record Company Says:+P+This CD is raw & electric - and one of my all time favorites.  I agree with one reviewer who said that he keeps trying to find another R.L. CD with this much energy, but can't.  I doubt we ever will.  If you like the "quieter", more traditional style of "Too Bad Jim", you may not find this to your taste.  But for raw power and emotion, you won't find anything else like it.  I think that's why I've played it so much over the past 5 years - it's just different.  First you get lulled by "Over The Hill" and then crashed into with "Alice Mae".  Also, check out the often overlooked gem on this collection - "Tribute To Fred".  The range on this CD is about as big as the style allows.  You'll reach for this whenever you don't want to hear the same old sounds+music
A selection---we need a complete set of all they did.+N+The Searchers are still touring and I saw them last year in Bay Shore, new York state. This album here is fine, BUT the group's work is much more worth getting INTO. We need the biggest most complete set possible. It is hard to get new listeners to hear some of their best songs: The World is Waiting for Tomorrow, Lovers Will, All a Dream, Till I Met You,  and so many more. Buy this if it's the best in your price range and then join the groups on the web where you can expand your Searchers appreciation! And don't forget to read Frank Allen's memoir of the group's history. It's fun+music
Mrs. Blue Bird saves the day+N+I bought this CD thinking that the songs, production, harmonies, or something would have been along the same lines as The Ballroom considering Curt Boettcher's involvment.....WRONG!  In MY opinion Mrs. Blue bird is the only worthwhile song on this disc, and it itself is only a marginal song, sorry. I was hoping they weren't going to be some rip off of The Sunshine Company. They're not at all, but maybe should have been.  I guess I was hoping for something that rocked a little bit, or had some killer harmonies, or some off the wall arrangements, or was at least up-tempo sometimes. Again, in MY opinion, besides Blue Bird, the songs are very draggy and slow. I've tried, I've listened to the disc serveral times to give it a change to grow on me. Not going to happen. My apologies.                +music
Should never have been made+N+This is one of the WORST compilations of 'acoustic' or 'remixed' music I have ever spent money on.  I am a huge fan of the first compilation, Metal Mania: Stripped.  It did *not* have a "Volume 1, The Ballads" on the CD jacket.  This disc's addition of that title, and the retro renaming of the first, was obviously a plan by the marketing types who saw the success of the first album and simply wanted to make more money.      The songs are simply really, REALLY bad versions of the originals.  The Scorpions (one of my all time favorite bands) seem more interested in having the audience or their female R&B back up singers perform the song than to sing it themselves.  The remnants of Ratt, Warrant, and Cinderella should be embarassed for doing what they've done to their few memorable songs.      A few of the tracks are decent, but overall I find this extremely poorly thought out.  I would suggest you make an effort to hear as much of this album as you can before you spend money on it; I am so dissapointed that I am not going to be purchasing another alubm for some time without real fear that it might be as poorly done as this one+music
In Response to "A Kid's Review"....+P+Has it ever entered your mind as to why people listen to Britney Spears? I would expect a pervert to be too busy watching cheap porn, a redneck to listen to musical trash such as "Redneck Yacht Club" (get the corresponding titles?), and a lonely person to spend his or her time staring at the wall... being, well... you know LONELY... as you claim. Twelve year old girls? Aren't they still playing with Barbies? I guess you, my friend, are yet another person for whom there is no enlightening+music
evocative tracks+P+it speaks for itself-someone broke into my car the only thing taken, my Diner tape+music
Not Received+N+I never received this item, I put the wrong address for delivery and the sender said they never got this back. It is in limb+music
Disapointed+N+this is probably the biggest disapointment I've ever had in a CD. When I bought this I was expecting the crazy Das Efx from Sewaside, Dead Serios and hold it down. If you know das efx then don't get this album. The beats  are all the same and the lyrics are wack compared to what they used to be+music
Spin doctors, this was real bad!!+N+They started so good, with the album &quot;Pocket full of kryptonite&quot; and goes on with this. thats hurt in my har+music
The Quartet+P+Mr. Parker's first album with this group, O'neal's Porch, rightfully received excellent reviews, appearing on NY Times top 10 list, and so on.  The group did release another album a couple years ago with a vocalist, so this is essentially the second album featuring only the quartet.  It was released in late March by AUM Fidelity through their website, which is why I, and it seems the below reviewer, have heard this CD many times.  I've listened to it almost every day for the past month, and I still look forward to listening it.    Parker has said that he would like his Orchestra to sound like a quartet- no easy feat considering the huge sound of it.  At times I feel like this quartet sounds like an orchestra, and not because they play particularly loud or aggressive.  As a matter of fact, this album is in many ways very straight ahead, full of melodies, walking bass, in the pocket drumming, and intertwined sax and trumpet.  The reason I say that it sounds like an orchestra is that sometimes you can just hear something bigger than the four players.  It has nothing to do with volume.  It might be that they play so naturally, effortlessly, and with such confidence in each other, that they become not only "a whole greater than the sum", but an entire new entity.  That may seem like hyperbole, but anyone who has seen William Parker play live knows that many strange things are possible.   More simply put, I think anyone can listen to this album and right away "get it".  This is not avant-garde, or free, or straight ahead, or whatever other label there is.  It is excellent music- and it also makes my crappy hour long commute somewhat enjoyable.+music
great music if you can tolerate the religious songs+P+Some excellent pickin' and a wide variety of styles make this a record that people who don't normally like that twangy, twangy country sound will find quite rocking. Unfortunately there is a lot of religious content which some might find objectionable-should there be a warning label on the cover? I find that if you just think they are saying "cheeses" every time someone says jesus it is much less objectionable+music
Great collection from a tight group+P+the Black Uhuru are one of reggae's greatest vocal trio's, the Wailers of the 80's if you will.  This set covers a time period of their greatest popularity.  All the songs on these 2 discs have a good groove to them, although some find that disc 2 seems to be repetitive.  Sly and Robbie throw down some great "riddims" that will leave you awe struck. I highly reccommend this for people who just can't get past Bob Marley and the Wailers, it is a must have for any music fan, espicially a reggae fan+music
Great, dark, brooding. +P+The mix is not up to par on this one, I hear alot of people complain abou the production. But the mix is my only problem with this very unique album from one of the worlds best metal bands today.  Jas+music
A surprise to me+P+Well , i get this Cd only a few days ago in November 2004. I was surprised about quality of his voice and of the entire CD. He had the ability to create music of a certain type without being repetitive. I especially appreciate "Til i get over you" , "The only one for me" and the title Track "Anytime".  So dim the lights , hold tight your girl and let the music play....+music
Who reallly did the PRODUCTION!!!!!!!!+P+It should be known that the incredible MARLEY MARL did produce this album. But, the man who was responsible for the beats was K-DEF! He did Funky Child, Chief Rocka, Here Comes the Lords, Lord Jazz Hit Me One Time, and From Da Bricks. ALL of the Standouts on the album. He went on to become a member of the group REAL LIVE, which also consisted of rapper LARRY-O. They were apart of MARLEY MARL's House of Hits production team. They released one album "The Turnaround: A Long Awaited Drama." For all Hip-Hip heads, this is an album that needs to be in collection. He also produced several songs on the LORDS 2nd album. One standout is "What I'm After." It is safe to say, that K-DEF is responsible for most if not all of the LORDS best known songs. If this album is considered a classic, then it should be said that K-DEF and MARLEY MARL deserves credit. PEACE. MADSCI...I write because I suffer, Inc. PASSAIC N+music
Absolute Heaven+P+Very rarely does Jazz give me that wonderful feeling only music can give.  I have the best of Duke Ellington, and a little known group headed by jazz/rock drummer Bill Bruford called Earthwork's; they're o.k.  But this album by Monk makes me wanna sing, and there aren't even any vocals in it.  I think Monk is among my favorite tunesmith's, up there with Mozart and Prokofiev.  That is because no matter how many times you listen to their works you never lose the stimulation or interest for a second+music
good but not great+N+Can "Miss Ross" let someone else produce her albums? She made some all time greats in the past when someone else was producing. She has great talents, a good voice although it's aging, but that's fine. This album made me listen to it once, and sadly put it away+music
The Time Has Come+P+Man Jae Millz is like one of my favorite underground rappers of all time. I had most of the mixtapes that have his songs on it. This CD doesn't look like a mixtapes to me, it looks like his debut album. I listed to his whole CD and it's banging. The song "Shadow Battling" samples of Special Ed song "Special" on his Still Got It Made album. One time, I thought he was related to Jay-Z but then I found out that he wasn't related to him. Somebody need to promote Jae Millz because this dude can rap; listen to his rhymes. I saw all his freestyle videos on youtube and some of them were long. Some of these rappers these days can't even write rhymes. Buy this CD to support Jae Millz+music
The 10 CD 30th Anniversary Collection is a better choice.+N+I don't really disagree with the other reviewers' evaluation of Piaf. She is truly one of the great artists of the 20th Century. I got this set; and then I got the 10 CD 30th Anniversary Collection. This 2 CD set has only a  few songs recorded in the late 50's and early 60's when recording  technology could do justice to her voice. The 10 CD set has several CD's  recorded toward the end of her career. The recorded sound is outstanding;  and Piaf was still in great voice nearly 'til the end. I know the 10 CD is  expensive; but I prefer it above anything else I have by Piaf+music
Ahead of it's time+P+This CD had huge breakdowns long before those were popular. Sure, they aren't as popular as all the "hardcore/metalcore" bands around now, but the similarities to that genre are striking when after listening to that music for a while you go back and listen to this one.+music
The Labyrinth soundtrack+P+Love the movie, love the soundtrack...it lags a bit during the instrumental pieces, but the Bowie tracks more than make up for it+music
In the beginning...+P+As a fan of the band waaaaaay back when I was in 10th grade (1980), I'm writing this review as the band experiences its renaissence ahead of its 30th  Anniversary World Tour.  Most will likely focus on the final recording "Synchronicity".  I prefer to start at the beginning.  Outlandos d'Amour landed quietly in the US as the second wave of punk-infuenced British bands began their invasion.  It's hard to remember, but The Police were contemporaries of Elvis Costello, The Sex Pistols, Buzzcocks, Ramones, and The Jam, and this album was released stateside at a time when Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, and The Who were the reigning Kings of British Rock.  No one knew it, but everything in music was about to change.  In contrast to the hyper-produced operatic sounds of mainstream FM "AOR" hard rock, the police were a spare, stripped-down, reggae-influence trio made up of a frenetic American drummer, and two Brits - both jazz afficionados.  Their sound captured the energy of the emerging punk scene, but if their arrangement seemed simple it was so only to let the elegant simplicity of their songcraft shine through.  Amidst the roar of British Arena rock, The Police landed in America, playing small clubs like NYC's now defunct CBGB, to even smaller audiences.  And while this was going on, like a hushed whisper -- a single song began climbing American radio charts.  A plaintive, tragic tale of a boy's idealistic love for a prostitute.  That song eventually became one of Rock music's most instantly recognized classics: Roxanne.  With that one song, The Police pried open the American radio audience and made way for the eventual torrent that became "New Wave".  As such, the band, and their debut album deserve recognition as a defining influence on the landscape of modern music, every bit as much as Nirvana  or The Beatle's for their seminal works.  There are few other memorable songs here that anyone other than an ardent fan would appreciate.  Other than Roxanne, only the tongue-in-cheek, suicidal break-up song "Can't Stand Losing You" ever made it into the US charts.  Still, the album flows pleasantly from start to finish, and the final cut "Mosoka Tanga", with its unintelligible lyrics, sets the listener up stylistically for the sophomore release (Regatta de Blanc) that eventually cemented the bands' now legendary success.+music
Oh, no; not these guys again...+N+I'll admit it; I never was much of a Pretty Ricky fan, especially after listening to Bluestars. I mean, I like sex as much as the next guy, but that seemed to be all these guys ever talked about -- and it didn't help that they have very, VERY below-average rapping skills (and Pleasure's singing is pretty okay). And this trend continues on Late Night Special.  Now, I won't say that nobody likes Pretty Ricky; after all, this album DID debut at #1 on the Billboard 200. But I have to say that this is another one of those cases where I looked at the other reviews and now I'm asking, "Did we all listen to the same album?" And aside from all the usual sexual talk, the guys still rely on dated rhymes, like "let me do you after school like some homework" ("Leave It All Up to You"), "you got me feenin' like Jodeci" ("Love Like Honey"), and, once again, "if I'm lyin', I'm flyin'" (the title track).  As was the case with the first album, the guys aren't very impressive when they DON'T talk about sex either, mainly because considering the way they normally rap (lyrics AND style), it's kind of hard to then take them seriously (especially Slick). This is evident on "Stay" (but Pleasure's singing is pretty God-awful on that song too) and the necessary song about clubbing, "Push It Baby". And "So Confused" is aptly titled because the chorus is about being in love with a girl who's taken, but then the verses contain their usual dirty talk.  This album also contains a pretty statutory song, the aforementioned "Leave It All Up to You". But in the long run, maybe that isn't HORRIBLE because teenage girls are probably the only people that'll pick up this album. Like I said before, I have nothing against sex, but if that's all you talk about AND you're wack, then it's really a turnoff. I'm going to have to pass on this late night special and see what else is on the menu.  Anthony Ruper+music
Great for the true fan+P+This CD has some favorite tracks you've heard before, and some tracks that only appeared on singles. The versions of songs from Do or Die aren't as good as the originals from Do or Die, but some of the new songs (Front Seat, Guns of Brixton) are great additions to any fan's catalog. Also, the live songs are pretty decent. Pick this album up only if you have their other CDs+music
real nice underground+P+i like this tape alot (or well the cd-version). i dont get how ppl can dig the new stuff from 3-6 at all, thats just lame club music. The old stuff has the good beats...but oh well its always the same story: at first they make real good songs just to get rid of anamosity, then comes the deals the money the industry and they start to produce crap for the mass.+music
Excellent!+P+This CD is one of his greatest.  I'm glad he released this one because it sure got nice and worn out in my car.  The first song, he comes out hard.  I wish he would have sung more of these songs at his concert that I attended in the fall.  He still wants to wear out his Til Shiloh cuts which indeed are classics but he is so talented that everything he comes out with is a classic.  But this Too Bad CD is nothing to fall asleep on.  Get it if you don't have it already+music
Old Stuff+N+Look this album is old as i dont know what,this album wasnt even finished,they started on it like in early 2001,as far as tha production it will always be tight from paul and juicy-J,this was like an underground album,not like a world wide realease,thats why some will say its not that tight as production wise,it wasnt even through,thats why they put some of there old stuff on there with pastor troy and boo thats stuff is old,have u noticed that paul and others where just on hooks,some where supposed to be on there but paul took there verses off,because t-rock left over money and mic time,the album wasnt done,so there for they threw old songs on there cause he left,which was stupid because he would of gotten paid,so he left and now he aint getting nothing from this album,all that money is going to paul and juicy,t-rock is dumb,look tha unbreakables is gonna set tha world on fire its gonna be there hottest album to date watch,with boo gone u know they gonna have alot of superstars on there i would tell u but i got to go,if u dont believe me wait and see holl+music
now that's what I call     doo doo....#14+N+YEEEA BOIII!  THIS MUSIC IS HOTT G!  YO BE SURE TO CHECK OUT DA RES A MA BOIS ON THE SCOOBY DOO 2 SOUNDTRACK YALL!!  IZ OFF DA HOOK!!! NAA MEAN!?!+music
STILL OVERPRODUCED BUT NOT HALF BAD+N+Best Song:  Moving Oleta Worst SOng:  Secret Biggest Let Down:  I'm Gonna Climb That Mountain and Sky Full of Angels.  (Patty Loveless could have done wonders with these!) Other Good Songs:  If I Had Any Sense Left At All; Room to Breathe; He Gets that From Me; Once You've Learned to Be Lonely; Forgettable:  Love Revival; Somebody; O.K. - The Duet with Vince Gill which made such an impression on me that I can't even remember the name of the tune.    The CD is way overproduced just like Reba's normal fare.  But the material here isn't half bad.  "Moving Oleta" should have been released as the single and should be winning awards for "Song of the Year".  By far one of Reba's most moving performances! +music
Good house music does not equal good music+N+2 1/2  Competent though disappointing, this highly referenced trance album cannot escape it's plodding, dated backbone of a beat, no matter how refined and professional the production tries to be. Of course, listening to the album 13 years later, one immediately feels the bland, aged thump soaked into the generic sequencing and tonality, which is not to say the album was not worthy of the praise it garnered upon release-in House-centric circles that is. The thudding, ever present, 4/4 layering of a pulse that guides entirely too much mainstream electronic music out there will vastly undermine any of the dreamy atmosphere heavily present on this ambitious little club-hopper, rendering most of the Yanni-with-edge keyboard melodies banal. Thankfully once in a while, particularly at the start and finish of the disc, a semi-potent spell is afforded these static conditions, allowing Dreamland to shine in refreshingly unrestricted ways+music
i like salif+N+i like the song of salif that why i look for one of his like les ambassadeurs international with salif keit+music
A Modern Minimalist Disaster+N+I sadly wasted approximately 2 hours of my life listening to this sorely lacking &quot;opera&quot;.  I was not at all surprised to read in the notes that the score had never actually been written to the piece, but rather, Monk came to the studio with a few ideas and improvised much of the work.  The tracks repeat endlessly without any meaningful development.  Some of them contain nonsensical dialogue as well, which adds little to the opera's overall effect.  Listen to the sample track &quot;Ice Demons&quot; for a good demonstration of ludicrous and pretentious composition.  While I'm not a devoted fan of minimalism in general, I can at least enjoy it on occassion.  In my opinion, some minimalist works like &quot;Einstein on the Beach&quot; by Philip Glass are far more sophisticated than Monk's opera and don't have the aggravating tendency to take themselves too seriously.  Monk's overdramatic spiritual nonsense really gets on the nerves+music
Heh?+N+You won't be my Yoko Ono unless I deserve it? You won't gain a career and fame overnight from absolutely nothing? You won't leverage me to the hilt? I don't pretend to understand, but I suppose I'm not empowered enough+music
I Love This Album, But.....+N+...somehow Sundazed screwed up the remastering. Several tracks sound overmodulated. It's the same sound you get when you overload a digital recorder, and I suspect that's what happened somewhere along the line when  this CD was made. It is a loud CD. It's frustrating because it's obvious  that Sundazed used the session tapes. If not for the added distortion, this  would be a great sounding CD from start to finish. If this had happened to  one of the Beatles CDs, the problem would have been corrected by now. But  since it's &quot;only&quot; a Raiders album, I guess we just have to put up  with this sloppiness. By the way, Sundazed did do a &quot;fix&quot; on  their &quot;Revolution&quot; CD, which had the same problem. The noise was  very obvious on that release, so I guess Sundazed felt they had to redo it.  As for the other PRR CD they released in '96, &quot;Something  Happening&quot;, it has the same problem and apparently no fix has been  done. Luckily, some cuts on &quot;Happening&quot; are totally free of the  noise+music
Ashes to Ashes+N+"Phoenix":  This is the first record Grand Funk made after one their core members was ousted--Terry Knight. It's a good record, at best. However, compared to the albums released before "Phoenix," it's a real yawner. The twinkie clavinet on some of the songs is hideously reminiscent of the Partridge Family's sound! It's the anti-GFR, I tell ya! Another negative is that the "Phoenix" era of GFR is sort of a precursor to "Christian Rock"--LAME! It's an all-too typical story in rock-n-roll land; the rich rock musician does things on tour that'd make the Marquis de Sade blush, feels guilty about it, and then hands out advice on how everybody else needs to find Jesus. GAG! The liner notes of this record states, "Although not a million-seller, "Phoenix" was nonetheless another Top Ten album for the band, and proved they could do it on their own." Well, I'm not sure just what they mean by that "IT," but for me "it" has to do with losing their great sound by kicking out one of Grand Funk Railroad's founding members, and replacing him with a large sack of Sweet'N Low.  About the "Grand Funk Remasters":   First of all, what took so freakin' long to release these records in this format? Why do we have to listen to crappy sounding CDs in this day and age? As Nathan (William Snape) says in "The Full Monty" during one his dad's (Robert Carlyle) clumsy dance rehearsals--"that were crap!" Even the Beatles catalog is taking forever to get released on quality CDs! ("The Capital Albums Vol. 1") Oh well, better late than never, I guess! I just have one last thing to say to the record companies, et al involved concerning this faux pas; guess which finger I'm holding up!   There's a world of difference between the sound of these CDs and the sterile sounding earlier digital releases of the same material; that fact alone justifies buying the remasters. However, the bonus music on these CDs makes them a must-buy for anyone who likes Grand Funk.+music
Sumptuous, sexy and sophisticated!+P+Even almost 20 years on this is still one of the greatest recordings ever.  Musically it has stood the test of time and represents some of the strongest songs Bryan ever wrote and recorded.  Stylistically "Boys and Girls" picks right up where Roxy Music's "Avalon" left off with lush cinematic paeans to the pursuit of love.  Rhett Davies production is sumptuous, warm and oh-so-well suited to Bryan's voice.  Nothing here rocks too hard and yet it's still nice mid-tempo jazz inflected numbers with enough beat to pulsate to but yet overall calm subdued and restrained.  A good friend of mine jokingly called this the granddaddy of Chill Out records and they're not far from it.  Perfect for coming down from a night of partying or as I call it the "ultimate make out record".  And try not to sing along...I dare you!  There is literally not a dud track in the lot and the music washes over you like waves in the ocean, starting with "Sensation" and carrying on through.  It's hard to pick personal favorites as they're all so strong, but "Don't Stop the Dance" is a killer track, especially when Bryan coos about "footsteps in the dark, come together".   In my humble opinion Bryan Ferry hands down has one of the sexiest voices ever and this is probably his sexiest recording.  "Boys and Girls" is the equivalent of slipping into something more comfortable, taking the phone off the hook, pouring a nice glass of wine, kicking back and doing something you really enjoy+music
A major disappointment to me.  The worst of the Morse era+N+An album I was looking forward to greatly after the success of Purpendicular. I was let down. It has in my opinion only one really great track - the first one. I tried a couple of years later to get into it again, hoping it was just my disappointment in not getting Purpendicular again. I still couldn't get into it. I've read a lot of reviews that say its' brilliant, but I just don't see it. Not recommended at all.   I know a lot of "Blackmore 70's era" Purple fans discount everything modern, but I'm not one of them - I absolutely adored _|_ as well as Bananas, but this one did absolutely nothing for me save for the first track+music
Very Bad+N+This is like dull opera vs. Trance. What a waist, I am mad I bought it+music
PAUL WELLER'S FAILURE+N+Ok, don't get me wrong I'm a major Paul Weller fan, since 1977, but apart from a couple a gems like 'Solid Bond' and 'Shout To The Top' this is Weller at his worst.After the rise and rise of The Jam, he tries to go all soulful and funky and misses by a mile.Don't waste your money on this rubbish, go buy The Jam boxset and listen to Weller at his most powerful and leader of the greatest band EVER+music
Superstar to Commercial Oblivion+P+Neither Fish Nor Flesh's downfall is it's lack of real commercial singles and a certain jealous Sony labelmate's sabotage if you believe Terence himself. That's not to say the music here is any worse overall than Hardline. The unofficially Stevie Wonder Summer Soft sampling &quot;To Know Someone Deeply&quot;, Motown-esque &quot;Billy Don't Fall&quot; and the gospel attack of &quot;I Don't Want To Bring Your God's Down&quot; are some favourites of mine. Don't believe the hype, there was no dramatic artistic post-Hardline disaster+music
One Tree Hill Rocks+P+Love the music!!! Usually not my style, however this is a CD my three girls and I can all enjoy!!+music
Awesome+P+off the easy! this mix is awesome, especially the ruff ryders anthe+music
What am I missing?+N+I think it is very admirable that Marsalis has attempted to produce a classical CD, however, this is not the sublime, masterpiece that so many previous reviewers have labelled it. His tone is particularly unstable, and not very even, his soprano playing is miles better than his alto however. This is a real shame, as the primary solo instrument in the saxophone family is the alto, anyone beginning study in classical saxophone would need to get this sorted first. His tuning is barely acceptable, but only for a jazzo, he would be shot if he played so out for a real saxophone teacher. Please have a listen to some real repertoire for saxophone, played by a real player, such as Bornkamp, Rousseau, Delangle, Fourmeau, Michat, Londeix, etc. This is a good INTRODUCTION to classical music, if for the first time, but please don't accept this as being the be all and end all of classical music, and of saxophone+music
A Hot TRAVIATA+P+I'm bewildered by the negative comments regarding this recording.  I finally obtained a copy of this and I have absolutely fallen in love with it. I have never heard a TRAVIATA as youthful, ardent, visceral and sexy, yes SEXY, as this one. Ok, there's some strange things in the first act, for instance, the chorus balance is off and Rizzi loses control between the stage and pit a few times.  But, in the course of a week, this has become a favorite recording of the work.   Netrebko's sound is gorgeous. She reminds me somewhat of the young Freni a la Russo. She's outgoing in the first act but introspect in the balance of the opera when confronted with real love.  Villazon is a god here and although this role can be sung beautifully by others, I have never heard a more well developed interpretation of this role. They are both very convincing together and what a pleasure it is today to hear two young singers with personality in their throats.  Their scenes have a desperate quality to them that no other interpretation has, as if they both understand how doomed their romance is.  There's a pronounced dark streak of tragedy running throughout their entire performance that the others lack.  Hampson has turned out to be a major surprise here as well. His vocal performance is complete and he develops Germont's character completely. Not since Gobbi's performance on the EMI recording (now available on Testament) have I heard any baritone really use his voice to act this role.   I'm even looking forward to the DVD release in mid June.  Putting the hype aside, this is one of the finest recordings of Traviata I've ever heard.  The committment of the principle singers is just stunning.  +music
Show me the meaning of being dated...+N+The Backstreet Boys are one of the most dated groups of the 1990s.  Lots of pop culture trends from the 90s are incredibly dated in 2006: Full House; Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles; hair metal; grunge music; the Macarena dance craze...but out of every trend that ever occured in that decade, nothing, and I mean NOTHING even comes close to being anywhere near as dated as boy bands are.  I recently heard the Backstreet Boys song "Everybody Backstreet's Back" and WHOA!!!  It was like stepping into a time warp!  Every one of these cheesy, manufactured, synthesized sound effects brought me deeper and deeper into the past, until I arrived way back in 1996!  This was an era when genuine musical instruments were virtualy non existant, and computerized synthesizers and drum machines ruled the pop music word.  Sure these corny sound effects were trendy and hip in 1996, but by 21st Century standards they just seem embarrasingly dated.  I can only reccommend this CD for one thing----making it feel like you're a decade back in the past.  I can't think of any other group from the 90s that sounds more dated than these guys.  "Show me the meaning of being dated Is this the decade I need to be stuck in Tell me why I can't be there where you are There's something dated in my heart+music
Same Day, Predicable Album.+N+Kurupt has made some good albums in the past, but this one is real dissappointment from him, I Expected more from this guy, but the writing is not impressive and the lyrical content is out of reach, although there are some good songs, west coast fans will love him and that's fine, but I Thought it was too predicable and too over the top.  Thumbs Down+music
Truly....+P+LIONEL is L-O-V-E!  No one writes love songs like Mr. Richie!  He's simply gifted!  This collection of songs will have you mellowed out in no time.  If you've had a hard day and want to relax, pop in this CD and it will make you melt and wash all the dirt of the day away!  Exceptional collection! +music
Truly Amazing+P+Having "Stuck On You" on this album (my all-time Lionel Richie song) is worth the price of this album alone, there are 13 other great tracks by this amazing artist. A MUST OWN if your a sucker for love songs like I am+music
Gould reconsidered and so should we+N+Gould's '55 recording of the Goldberg variations was a challenging statement from a very young man. Perhaps it needed to be played this way, at least once, or perhaps Gould needed to play it this way at that time.  He thought better of it and re-recorded the work in '82 and it is this last interpretation that will stand the test of time. It is an interpretation that is much closer to the accepted sound, but how beautiful it is! Bach doesn't need eccentric rhythms and tempi to gain attention and it turned out that neither did Gould. You can still hear his vocalise (love it or loathe it - I love it), but the passion, depth and strength of the later work overshadows his earlier effort and nearly everyone else's efforts too. Hear them both and then decide for yourself  RIchard Maycoc+music
"We'll sing 'em all and we'll stay all night!"+P+If there has ever been a better live album than Judy at Carnegie Hall, I'd like to know what it is. Simply exhilarating in audio, one can only imagine what it was like to be in that audience in 1961.  How did they manage to not spontaneously combust? There are so many spin-tingling moments that one is hard-pressed to choose a favorite. From the subdued and sublime ballad If Love Were All to the raucous tributes Chicago and San Franciso, Judy covers all the bases and hits a home run every time. Even when she forgets the lyrics, as she does in You Go To My Head, she does it brilliantly and with charm.  I've owned this album in one form or other since I was a kid in the 1970s and I never get tired of it. Even if you think you don't like this kind of music it is an amazing experence. Buy this. Buy it now+music
Keep on Shining+P+The ozarks remain one of country rocks best kept secrets. Although the New Musical Express here in the UK described them as 'One of the finest bands of the '70's in any field' they are not well known - but they should be.  Hailing from Springfield, Missouri the band are amongst the most eclectic in rock, almost every band member wrote material, sang and played an array of instruments. Their harmonies certainly equalled the Eagles, and their sound incompassed 'down at home'  bluegrass, FM rock, melodic folk country, but also more experimental arrangements such as 'Colorado Song' on their debut release.  'It'll shine' is the ozarks second offering and it's great to get it on CD. There was a trend for bands in the early 70's to get back to the country, well the ozarks never really left it recording the material at a pre Civil War farmhouse with Glynn Johns producing.  There is a real joy on this disc, of a band in tune with nature and each other playing to their strengths. Everyone will know Larry Lee's 'Jackie Blue' which was a big hit for the band and is good straight pop rock, but not entirely representative of the rest of the material, although 'Look Away' and 'tidal wave' show the band can rock.  For me it's the lighter and rootsy material that make it. 'You made it right' with its southern gospel feel, 'Lowlands' with its magnificant harmonies and the slightly zany 'EE Lawson' typical of steve Cash's work.  The disc closes with the title track leaving on a sentimental, and uplifting note. This disc is waiting to be discovered by any serious music fan - give it a try+music
Vince Gill?+P+All the reviews I have read of the PPL CD's have had to do with the two leaders of the band, and while they are both great singer/songwriters. I think the real fun in listening to these songs is trying to spot that high, sweet, soft background vocal, and some of that shimmering guitar sound. It is none other than Vince Gill, you know, the artist to have won a grammy for every year in the decade of the 90's, the man to have quietly lived out one of the most succseful music career's in a long time. I just find a lot of enjoyment in imagining a young 19 year old Vince gill finding his way in his new music career. He's married to Amy Grant you know, huh &quot;Amie&quot;... Amy. If that's not fate I dont know what is. Good songwriting, check it out+music
NOT AS GOOD AS 6TH SESSION+P+This is a good cd but not as good as his previous work. The 2nd cd is almost a throwaway except for the KAOS track. You have to see him live to truly appreciate him+music
Great remixes of a future dance classic+P+This is a great compilation CD single.  The artist put a lot of time and effort.  She obviously sang the tracks over for each of the remixes+music
Great Collection Of Early Poco+P+THE FORGOTTEN TRAIL is a great collection of early Poco. The only major item missing from it is "Skatin'", but you can get that on one of the group's studio CDs. As a person who's been told to use music as a form of anger management, I have to say that I prefer the early country-rock Poco to later pop crap like "Crazy Love" and "Call It Love.+music
A Good Album is a Good Album+P+Thanks for the background on this movie's soundtrack Mr. Davids, and it's great to know you support Native American musicians. But to give this album one star out of five just because Lisa Gerrard isn't Native American is ridiculous, and frankly, racist. Peter Gabriel's "Long Walk Home: Music from the Rabbit-Proof Fence" was a similarly haunting, ethereal collection of songs. The movie focused on the aboriginal peoples of Australia. Think anyone cared that Peter Gabriel isn't an aborigine? Like Gabriel, Gerrard has worked with musicians of several ethnic origins, and has always made efforts to support and promote them. This in turn increases cultural awareness of marginalized ethnicities for the mainstream consciousness, and represents one of the fundamental altruistic forces in what has been blanket-termed "world music." We should applaud musicians like Gerrard, not castigate them. Or, the very least, we should judge music by the talent of the composer, not by that composer's ethnicity.      -Amahl Turczyn Scheppach, music lover. Ethnic Origin: White/Other+music
Fresher than funk+P+Hmm, I've gotta disagree with the reviewer who rated this just another funk band with some scratching.  Kid Koala takes a lead role in this band, and is not relegated to some background scratching as is often the case.  The integration of the turntables is also far beyond what you might normally hear.  This isn't a group where the DJ takes a break to show off his funky beats, Kid Koala meshes his skills seamlessly with the rest of the band.  To  top it off the vocals are superb, straight out of the congregation.  This band is up there with the best of the new hip hop/soul/funk (Breakestra, Dakah, and Medusa)+music
Vintage Joan!+P+I have the LP of this album and it is almost worn thru! I decided that if it was available on CD I would get it as a birthday present to myself! I found this to be one of the best purchases I have made lately. The remastering of the original songs is perfect and the bonus tracks are great! Joan's voice is still clear and sweet and very easy to listen to. Her voice got a more raspy sound on later albums. The bonus tracks were the icing on the cake for me. She covers a wide range of folk songs, from Guthrie's "Ranger's Comand" to "Rock Salt and Nails" by Bruce 'Utah' Phillips. It is interesting to note that the people who made the labels for the album did not know that there is a substance known as Rock Salt that is often used in shotguns as a 'varment load' and therefore list it as "Rock, Salt and Nails!" No matter what you call it I found it to be one of the most haunting songs I have ever heard. All in all, if you like Joan Baez and/or folk music this is a must have. Her version of "One too many mornings" brings back vivid memories of the '60s+music
best rancid album of all time!+P+to me, this is rancid's best work. i don't understand why people say it's "rough around the edges", and crap like that! this is punk people! anyways, every song is fast, and catchy - which to me makes it a classic. this album kicks off with "adina", (one of the best songs on this CD) which is a fast short song, with awesome guitar riffs. and after you hear that song...you definetely will wanna listen to the next - trust me. and the next song "hyena", is another one of the best songs, and an awesome chorus that's all yelling...every song has it's own thing that makes it good. one of the slower songs, has got to be "outta my mind". tim's singing is what makes this song a classic (to me). tim's guitar work, bret's drumming, and matt's bass playing are at their best on this album. so if you're new to rancid, i would HIGHLY recommend this. if not this, "let's go" is another good one.+music
Not the same+N+With Paul out of the picture, The Unseen are definitly not the same band at all. It just seems all the passion has been drained. This album has ok songs, but nothing special. Stick to the first two albums, which were some of the best street punk records of their time+music
*Thumbs Down*+N+This cd isn't TOO bad but at the same time I wish i hadn't bought it.  I think the singer said to himself "Let's see how i can ruin this record by whining like a country singer all emotionally".  (And in a realllly bad way) Oddly enough, the absolute best song these guys ever put out isn't featured on either of their cd's. (Sweet Summer) Besides the fact that this is missing that gem of a song, it's nothing like the first cd.  Nothing quite like the cathy pop rhythms of Don't Stop on this cd. Just kinda BLAND soft rock. I recommend downloading Sweet Summer as it is their best song by FAR and perhaps possibly buying the first cd, but don't waste your time on this one+music
What Happened?+N+I really liked Tevin Campbell in Disney's "A Goofy Movie". It made the movie really special. But now when I go and see what his old CDs were like, they sound almost nothing like the guy. The music is WAY too slow paced and his voice sounds bored and well... like it's just dragging on and on. Maybe it was because the music was more upbeat and bassey--not to mention totally cool in the movie. I only gave the CD two stars because of his terrific performance in "A Goofy Movie". Check out that CD if you want to see the best of Tevin+music
Mame is fantastic+P+Not only for lovers of Broadway but great music in general I highly recommend this CD.  Not only is the Jerry Herman tunes fantastic but Angela Lansbury has one of Broadway's greatest voices+music
What's with all the yowling?+N+Amazing jazz but would be much better without all the yowling (is he okay?).  Because yowling seems to be part of the Keith Jarrett jazz experience this was my first and last Keith Jarrett purchase.  Check out something by Bill Evans.  Make the yowling stop!  Please+music
I have a crush on Sufjan.+P+It borders on obsession. I think he's incredibly talented and I love him and all his music. This Christmas album really put me in the spirit. It actually reminded me of when I was a little kid and Christmas still seemed like a religious holiday. I am now an athiest, but somehow listening to Sufjan sing about Jesus just makes me happy. My favorite songs are "Put the Lights on the Tree" and "Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing."+music
Watch out! Not the originals+N+This album features 70s re-recordings of ET's hits. His Texas Troubodors at the time were a good band, but Ernest's voice had coarsened quite a bit by then. You can now get the original 40s and 50s recordings of Ernest's  hits on the Hall of Fame series. Even the 1958 remakes originally on the  Decca/MCA &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; and &quot;Ernest Tubb Story&quot; were  pretty good...but this album is for completists only+music
Passionate, Intense, Yet Beautiful+P+A stunning album.  Yes, it's &quot;free&quot; and &quot;out,&quot; but it's also very lyrical and emotional music.  One of Hutcherson's best performances, by the way.  Tip:  If Dave Holland's &quot;Conference of the Birds&quot; is one of your favorite albums, you have to hear this+music
Not loungy enough for me...+N+This is just plain boring swing, there is no zing in the arrangements to make it special, or worth listening to more than once, this went straight from the cd player, into the waste basket.  Not even one good uptempo song on the whole set.  Boo+music
east west yes+P+An benthusiast of both Philip Glass &amp; Ravi, I find this cd even more delightful than I had expected before the purchase.  Listening to Glass's simple uplifting melodies accompanied by TABLA is exhilerating.  Listening to Ravi Shankar's sitars with a cello line composed by Glass is awesome.  I recommend this cd to anyone interested in either composer or style of music.  It pleases both aesthetics+music
trash+N+If you like punk, you'll hate this garbage. A total mess, and not in a good way. Throw any copies you find laying around in the trash and be done with it+music
Good, strong album+P+If you like Damn Yankees, you'll probably like this CD.  It's not quite as heavy, but Shaw & Blades complement each other really well and the tracks are all solid+music
A Work of Genius+P+I bought this album back in 1973,and this has always seemed like a work of genius. The line-up of electric violin (Goodman), guitar (Mclaughlin), keyboards (Hammer), drums (Cobham) and bass (Laird)was new. The music is influenced by Coltrane, Cream, Lifetime, Indian music and probably Miles' Bitches Brew band. Although they use electric instruments, the music is complicated and difficult to listen to. Its speed and ferocity make it challenging and alien for those not familiar with jazz. Ken Scott who engineered for the Beatles and later produced David Bowie made the album sound like a rock album.   At the time, the musicianship and the interplay were a revelation. Jazz critics accused these guys of selling out, but it's much more adventurous than the average jazz album of its time. in 1973, Jeff Beck declared the Orchestra the best band in the world, and he was probaly right.     +music
Not quite the ultimate chill out but still good+P+I guess after hearing the fifth volume in the Buddha Bar series, my expectations of chill out compilations have been raised. I have been spoiled by the diversity of the well-knowned chill out series. So when I bought Nettwerk's &quot;Chillout 2003: The Ultimate Chillout&quot;, I thought it could have been better and less predictable. As much as I love Moby and his song &quot;In This World&quot; and Sasha's &quot;Wavy Gravy&quot;, I thought those two songs could have easily been left off this cd. On the other hand hearing a new song from &quot;Delerium (&quot;Love&quot;) and a remix of my favorite Conjure One song &quot;Tears From the Moon&quot; made it well worth buying the cd, which I found a used copy in the used bins at my favorite record store. The Delerium song &quot;Love&quot; was nothing I have ever heard before from my favorite ambient act. Faithless' Zoe Johnston lends her stunning vocals to the beautiful song. I also loved Kirsty Hawkshaw's &quot;Fine Day [Frakker Mix]&quot;. I remember hearing samples of that song on an old Orbital song. Of course what is a Nettwerk compilation without a Sarah McLachlan track? To be honest, I actually enjoyed the William Orbit mix of &quot;Black&quot;. I am nowhere tired of that song as I am with Delerium's &quot;Silence&quot;. I wasn't too wild about the Telepopmusik or Fischerspooner tracks. Both groups I find vastly overrated. I loved Ihb's &quot;Olivia Newton Christ&quot; and FC Kahuna's &quot;North Pole Transmission&quot;. Hooligan's &quot;Hear Me Now&quot; and New Order's &quot;Your Silent Face&quot;. With all its imperfections, &quot;Chillout 2003&quot; is quite good but it isn't the ultimate chill out as the title say. I leave that title to my favorite chill out compilation &quot;Buddha Bar V&quot;+music
Great Listening+P+This cd caught me by surprise with it's wide range of melodies. The more I listen the more I like it+music
Pretend this one wasn't made+N+I have not heard Kerplunk, but probably out of Dookie, Insomniac, Nimrod, Warning, and American Idiot, this is the only one I would truly label as bad (Nimrod was better, but not great either). The sound is very forced. Green Day admitted that they tried to make it darker sounding to lash out at fans who criticized them as sellouts. It also was trying a little too hard to preserve the "I'm still punk" notion which fortunately Green Day gave up years later.  I have known for a long time that Billie Joe was never the best guitar player, (except the guitar playing is pretty good now)and Brain Stew's refrain that is supposed to sound like a ticking clock is very bad. It sounded even worse in the live album, Bullet in the Bible.  Geek Stink Breath is really the only other song on this album I liked. However, its too short and the guitar playing way too simple.   In general, unless you are a major Green Day fan, there really isn't much you're missing in this album.+music
Another excellent blues cd from one of the new stars+P+ALBERT CUMMINGS seemed to capture the feel of SRV very well on his previous CD and it was excellent ( even if a bit derivative ). This one is a lot less SRV and a lot more CUMMINGS. Not one dud track and a consistenly high standard throughout. Definetly one of the best of the current crop of white electric blues man. If you like the guitar and the blues, this is a must have+music
save your money+N+I got nothing but mad love and respect for the outlaws but they have def lost a step since pac's death. I think tupac must have wrote there rhymes cause they def do not have any skills. The cd also lacks production! The beats are terrible. The outlawz worldwide cd was also a huge waste!+music
At last!  An X album I DON'T like!+N+Here I thought they were infallible and they go do this one-off "ner ner" music that inspires intimate thoughts regarding blood relations and livestock.  I played it backwards and not only did I sober up, but my wife came back to me, my dog came back to life, my truck got fixed, the bank took the lien off my house and I bowled a perfect game!  Signed, epsteinsmutha+music
Dolphy and the European excursion+P+For this Dolphy fan, Last Date stands the test of time as one of his finest performances.  Recommended to any jazzcat into 60's avant.  Dolphy explodes on bass clarinet on his version of Monk's classic, Epistrophy.  Dolphy, Epistrophy...hmmm? The drum and bass work is nothing special but the Scandanavian team does the job.  The piano player (also Scandanavian) is a nice surprise with interesting melodic and rhythmic chord placements.  All in all, one of Dolphy's best and one to go back to time and time again for new insights.  There's even a quote from Eric after the final track.  A must buy for anyone who says they're seriously into jazz+music
Yummy+P+A great album. Not perfect. The songs themselves are addictive, inventive despite sounding like something you've heard before, crunchy and sexy. I love how Holme's voice changes from song to song. A great vocalist, which leads me to wonder why Eagles of Death Metal has him on drums and that Macho Macho Man wanabe on vocals. The real star of this album though is the guy who's not even in the band, Dave Grohl. His drum playing on this album is incredible. Good stuff. Get rid of the annoying radio clips and the terrible 6th song and it would deserve a 5/5+music
Overrated Group+N+When I first started to get into Doo Wop, back in the early '70's, the records of the Channels were some of my favorites. I played "The Closer You Are" a zillion times on my stereo. It just had this a particularly striking sound that you couldn't put into words. Earl Lewis' voice, to me at that time. was unlike nothing I'd ever heard, and nothing I'd ever hear again. I was caught up by the beauty of the "New York sound", and loved it. The same was true with many of the other Channels records that I got to add to my collection. To me, they were always at the top of my favorites list, or close to it. Nothing could dissuade from loving each and every one of their records.  Until, in 1970, reality set in. I saw them live at a "rock and roll revival" show, at the Academy Of Music Theater, in Manhattan. They were billed, along with 8 other groups, in a outstanding show. Once the Channels showed up on stage, one problem became obvious: Earl Lewis couldn't sing to save his life. And these, supposedly, were the best years of his voice. True, he attempted to get through "the Closer You Are", "The Gleam In Your Eye", "That's My Desire", and several of their other local hits with the group. But every time he did so, it became apparent that the guy had no pitch. He just couldn't find the notes. The result was one of the worst listening experiences of my life. "Pain In My Heart" was a pain in my ears.   You could say that Earl simply had a bad night. I wish that was the case, but every time I saw them on stage, probably six times in all, through the next four years, featured along with a number of other groups in other shows, it was the same story. When the group backed away, and Earl Lewis had his solo parts to do, he was about as sour and as off-key as a singer could get. (That's still the case, even these days.) And what was remarkable to me was how the auduence, at every show, never noticed. They applauded and cheered, as though everything was just the way it should've been. How sad. There was more attention placed on the nostalgia of the song, than how well or poorly it was performed.  These experiences made me go back to my collecton, and listen to my Channels records with some better insight. I began to think that on a few of them, Earl Lewis simply got lucky on a few takes, and actually found the notes! The backup group, while adequate (and also somewhat off-key), isn't the greatest ensemble to hear, either. For proof, listen to their disastrous version of "That's My Desire", and compare it to the Flamingos' recording. For better, exquisite singing, check out the Harptones, the Moonglows, the Jive Five, the Dubs, or anything by the Flamingos. In my opnion, as far as the records of the Chanels are concerned, the best of the bunch are "Bye Bye Baby" and "MY Love For You Will Never Die". They were a better than average (on a few of their recordings) NY group, but hardly worthy of the praise they're given. And believe me: Until I saw them live, I used to be awed by what I thought was incredible talent. Not anymore. I hate to burst anybody's bubble, but it helps to put it all in perspective+music
Where did it all go wrong?+N+Considering he was one half of the excellent Wham! great things were expected from Mr Michael when he went solo. Unfortunately the pressure must have got to him as this album is a disaster. Fans of classics such as Wham Rap, Bad Boys and Club Tropicana Drinks Are Free will be bitterly disappointed. It seems obvious to me that Andrew Ridgeley had been carrying Mr Michael for years+music
Faith in George!+P+After that Wham! broke up it was almost inevitable that George Michael would become a solo star, he had already had a solo hit with "Careless Whisper" "A Diffrent Corner" and his duet with Aretha Franklin "I Know You Were Waiting" was also a hit. "Faith" was released in 1987 and it also sold around 10 millions copies, it was without a doubt George's most comercially succesful album. "Faith" shows maturity but it also continues with catchy uptempo songs that Wham! were famous for, it's a great mix between effective soul-pop like the title track and slow personal ballads like "Father Figure". It also had a great streak of 5 #1 hits on the billboard charts. George also became the first white male artist to reach #1 at the R&b charts.  First single "Faith" is a catchy uptempo that almost became a trademark for him. It starts with a face-up organ for most of the song but eventually a one-chord guitar is introduced too. It's a hell of a song. "Father Figure" is a far more moody song, infact it's a soulish ballad that feautures gospel choirs and a somewhat mysterious sound. Both Faith and Father Figure were #1 hits.  "I Want You Sex l&ll" Is indeed 2 diffrent version of the song, it's 9 minutes long. The first one is soul-pop but the second in more retro-soul with horns, something that Phil Collins would have been proud of. The song was considered very controvercial upon it's release, both the title and the lyrics were offensive to many people and the song was banned from certain stations and would only be played at late night on MTV. The song was a #1 hit in US nonetheless.  "One More Try" is a touching ballad about a man not willing to get into a new relationshiop cause he had been hurt so many times before. It was his 4th #1 hit from "Faith". "Hard Day" was never released on single but would have become a hit too I think. It's a uptempo song that reminds me of "I Want Your Sex".   "Hand to Mouth" was also a non-single, it a great touching slow paced song about the American Dream. It tells the story of 2 diffrent people that both want to experience the American Dream, but none succeeds one shoots at people and the other one ends up becoming a prostitute. Critizism to Reagan's America, simular to the recent single "Shoot the Dog" towards Bush.  "Look At Your Hands" is a jazzy song that also brings up social issues, this time domestic violence. "Monkey" is a catchy uptempo aswell, it was his 5th #1 hit and it's not hard to understand why. The ballad "Kissing A Fool" only reached #5 and was the last single from this album. It sound alot like the upcoming material he was going to release later on. The upcoming song are remix of "Hard Day" and the last one being a third version of "I Want Your Sex" this one is very slow paced though.  Overall, A great solo debut for George that not only sold incredibly well but also is flawless from song 1 to song 11. All songs are worthwile, and he makes a good mix of catchy uptempo's to touching ballads. A 80's classic without a doubt+music
Great Music but poor sound+N+Definitely contains their great hits, however the remastering is very poor. Listen to it with or without earphones and you can hear bad distortion. My vinyl recordings of these songs sound 1000% better+music
Really bad transfer+N+Most of the tracks are severely clipped. You can do a better job than this with the vinyl and a PC. Very disappointing+music
Boy is He Faithful! +N+I remember when Saturday Night Live did a spoof of Irene Cara from Fame singing the theme song from the movie as "Same:" "Same!  I sing the same song forever."  Maybe Peter should have gone that route instead of this album.  I just got through listening to it, and have decided he should never have left Chicago.  Sure, it's a nice, slick adult contemporary recording, but it's also the same exact song with different lyrics eleven times in a row.  Sometimes he duets with two females who sound exactly alike--Crystal Bernard (Hee-hee-hee, gimmie a break!) and Ronna Reeves, whose unique vocal style even manages to get the authenticity sucked out of it here.  Even his remake of the beautiful "Happy Man" from his Chicago days is reduced to an extremely unattractive entrail of itself.    So why 2 stars instead of one?  Production quality is key here, and it's nice wallpaper music for wallpapering by.  Beside that, it's Peter, and at least his voice is good.  Other than that, this is a lackluster piece of offal that I wasted under ten bucks on.  My second and last solo Cetera album, I suggest you steer clear of this album unless you find 11 versions of one song entertaining. +music
Kraftwerk - good old songs+P+first generation of electronic sound, very relaxing, makes me return to good old times....+music
What is going on?+P+Ok, I'm getting sick of seeing people that don't understand why Mark Collie's "In Time" is on this CD.  Let me educate you all...unlike Spiderman or the rest of the Marvel characters, the Punisher is HUMAN.  In time he will die...all it will take is a bullet.  If you sit down and listen to the words of "In Time" you'll see this.  Maybe its just me, but I'd rather listen to "Johnny Cash's evil tiwn" than yet another Creed rip off or a "I'm pissed at the world" song+music
Chris's Second Best+P+I've attempted to give five stars to 'Shamrock Diaries' so I can't really give the same to 'On The Beach' despite it being stylistically similar to its predecessor, and nearly as good.  Really, a very, very good album with  only a few clunkers.  Great melodies, great atmosphere+music
Yikes!+N+Sarah Hudson's album has been compared to Skye Sweetnam's 'Noise From The Basement'. WHAT? There is no comparison - Skye Sweetnam has actual talent. While Sarah...  What sort of lyrics are - "I can't hold on forever/I know that you know I know" and "I wanna go shopping like Wynona Ryder" and "you better lock your doors/the bitch is back."?  "Naked Truth" is not about the music. This album is about manufacturing a woman trying to be a girl, singing about things that she's too old to identify with. The tunes are trying their best to be hardcore - but they arent. Sarah is trying her best to be Skye Sweetnam - but she's not.  Besides, Skye Sweetnam is actually a great role model for youngsters. Sarah is not+music
Not as good as I'd hoped+N+I liked early Winger, mainly their hit singles but the entire "In the Heart of the Young" album was pretty good, if straying a little too close to Def Leppard.  I have to say that those works haven't stayed with me, and are only worth a listen when I'm in exactly the right mood.  "Pull" saw a darker, blusier side and was all the better for it.  In the end, however, only "Down Incognito" and the fantasticly rockin' Leppard-esque "Junkyard Dog" remain with me to this day.  I skipped Winger altogether until I read the reviews posted for IV.  I thought I'd give them a try, hoping this time a modernized Winger would create a catchy yet serious side that held out through the whole album.  Sadly, IV falls into the same category as an English journalist once said of British cooking:  "Fine preparation, but desperately in need of spice."  The musicmanship is top notch as are Kip's vocals, the latter of which remain strong and with the same great range he's always had.  But where did the great riffs go?  IV is a softly bubbling pot of an album.  There are no songs that really make your ears perk and demand a 2nd or 3rd listen before moving on.  Conspicuous by their absense are any lasting, ear-grabbing riffs to pull you in and demand you jam along.  Sorry to say, it's an album of well-crafted filler+music
The album trivium wish they made instead of Crusade+P+This band got it right for creating good modern metal. Trivium's new album crusade failed in this respect since trivium lost their agression and just sold out to melody. This album has the right mix of aggression and melody. The guitar breakdowns are interesting, the vocals are very good another good mix of aggressive screamo and timely melodic chorus.+music
For Jed and Granny Only+N+I guess if you love country this cd is ok, but for those of us that came to Dolly durning her &quot;9 To 5&quot; peroid..this is really horriable music. Sorry dolly....I sold it back to the stor+music
To sleep!+N+the only thing this album can do to me is put me to sleep. I do not know what in theworld was James thinking when he mixed this album. Not great, not pleasent, not good at all+music
An Overlooked Gem+P+I've picked up all of Badfinger's album and this one is the best. My favorite tracks include Got To Get Out of Here, Dennis, In the Meantime, and Meanwhile Back at the Ranch. The Production is fantastic - Big thanks to Chris Thomas - and the band is tight! The guitar ending to Meanwhile Back is thrilling. The songwriting of the group throughout the album stands head and shoulders above any of the other albums. Any potential hit singles to go along with Day After Day or No Matter What? No, but there's not a weak song in the whole album. It flows perfectly, pulling you along with its sound, craftsmanship, and melody. What a crime it was for Warner Brothers to pull it after only 3 weeks! A definite overlooked gem+music
A supergroup that didn't need any hype at all+P+JD Souther, Chris Hillman and Richie Furay had a history in the musicbusiness before they joined the SHF-band and it didn't do any harm I have to tell you. The album was hyped at the time, maybe the reason the group didn't reach to its full potential. The album still hit #11 in the BB album charts in 1974 with Furays''Fallin' in Love' being their only hitsingle. There's more here than just that one 'Heavenly fire' 'Deep, dark and dreamless' being beautiful richly harmony filled country ballads 'Border Town' and 'Safe at home' hard rocking popsongs which might as well have been recorded by Poco or the Eagles. Maybe that was the main problem: although all 10 songs where written by groupmembers, the sound was not unique. Never the less this group deserves recognition for providing at an excellent collection of 10 beautiful songs on one album. A huge accomplishment in a period in which fans of the more succesful groups had to do with one or two gems on one lp. They could saved their money and just bought this one+music
Sicx's Flows+P+This cat can bust.It doesn't matter what he raps about,he's just tight on the mic.He is an under rated underground rapper so far.Believe me I know Hip Hop+music
Sorry Koop+N+I am a huge triple6 fan, especially of the founding members.  These guys all have tons of tallent and impress me with almost everything they touch  However this is the worst album I own by any origional 3-6 member.  I tried to like it b/c of how origional tha koopsta is but every time I listen to it I find my self skipping to the next song untill I have made it thru the album in about 10 minutes.  If you want a real KK album get the devils playground.  Thats a solid junt.   +music
Only 1 Reason To Buy This:  Miracle Legion!+N+One of the weaker entries in this hit-and-miss collection of New Wave singles, there is only one legitimate reason to own this, but it's a great reason:  Miracle Legion's &quot;The Backyard.&quot;  Miracle Legion was a mid-80's college radio band which, like most of the college radio bands of the era, had that sort of post-Byrds, post-VU moody guitar jangle sound (i.e. R.E.M., Guadalcanal Diary, Reivers, Connells, Winter Hours, etc.).  Not a great band, but this one song -- by far their best -- is unforgettable.  An irresistable hook and some moving lyrics about growing out of boyhood make it one of those songs that, 15+ years later I can still sing from memory.  It bears about as much relationship to &quot;New Wave&quot; as, say, Husker Du, but, hey, what can you do.  The rest of this disc ranges from the sort of lame radio hits my generation was forced to live with at the time (&quot;Voices Carry&quot;) to songs so bad that the mere thought of them still makes me wince (&quot;Sunglasses at Night&quot;)+music
Great Song!+P+The previous reviewer's reference to this song having the sound of Giorgio Moroder is right on the money.  I loved Moroder's work in the 80's and that's what attracted me to this song.  The rest of the album though is boring.  This song makes up for that.  Bring on the video!!!+music
Not as hardcore as it should/could be.+N+Being a huge Gatecrasher and Cream fan for quite some time, I was excited about this new release. Well after alot of anticipation for it's arrival, I am a little disappointed. It really doesn't have the hardcore feel of previous releases. It isn't bad....but it it isn't great. It is not because of the choice of tracks that is to blame, just the choice of remixes. Many friends have listened to this compilation also, and share similar opinions. Want something better? Choose an Gatecrasher compilation from 2002 - 2005....You'll Love it+music
one good track +N+Other than the genuinely great remix of Atomic by Diddy, the remixes here are highly forgetable. Most remixes completely miss the point of the orginal tracks and sound like they were slapped together very quickly for a quick buck.  Avoid+music
excellent+P+excellent performances by chet baker. his voice is unique and is highly recommended to all jazz lovers. It is so rare to find so many songs by chet baker in one collection and here are some wonderful songsby a wonderful jaxx singer and player+music
Dr_Bites+N+Over the years, I have tried in vain to purchase the "real" original version.. Yes, Donny Osmond is decent and all.. I grew up watching him and his family on tv.. But concerning this title, they try to pass off the various versions on this site and in stores as "The Original Version".. It's not... I have the "Real" Original version on vinyl.. I've been looking to replace it on CD..  The "real" original has been way overshadowed, if not completely forgotten, by the various versions over the years with cast after different cast.. The "Real" original was actually recorded and released in 1971 ("After" Jesus Christ Superstar (1970), not before it).. It was performed by The Joseph Consortium, on Scepter Records, and had a black cover with a small litho-drawing of Joseph in a white and gold coat.. The front of the cover had a "flap" that opened up and told about the album.. The "real" original version blows all these versions out of the water.. I know because I bought them all, in hopes that one "was" the real version.. I give up.. If anyone has a cassette version or a CD performed by The Joseph Consortium (The "real" original version) and want to part with it, leave a message here and hopefully we can hook up and work something out.. Here's to hoping.. Thanks..+music
denlan+N+It's a shame, I wonder sometimes how some no talented singers like Rickie Lee Jones managed to even sing somewhere and have a record company sign them. She's awful, no voice at all. I rated 1 star only because 0 star is not available on the scale.   +music
Warning: Check The Shingles On Your Roof....................+P+.........before playing Mama Feelgood, or vocalist Lyn Collins is going to leave your home in need of some repairs. From the guitar-piano-guitar introduction, Collins delivers a funk tour-de-force performance in a classic song on a great soundtrack for an underrated movie that stars Fred Williamson.  The score was composed by James Brown and Fred Wesley, which starts with a smoking R&B number - Down and Out in New York City - and ends drenched in the blues - Like It Is, Like It Was.  It is four consecutive numbers which makes Black Caesar not only a remarkable soundtrack, but one of the best albums ever issued by Brown. The mid-tempo of Boss bounces into Brown at his funky best - Make It Good to Yourself. Collins then tears it up, with the ballad - Mama's Dead - a gem of an emotional ride by Brown.  There are several instrumentals, with the jazzy Sportin' Life and the quick pace in Chase emerging as the best.  Brown wore the crown as "The Godfather of Soul" after the soundtrack was released in February 1973. And the soundtrack leaves no doubt that J.B. set the rules for admittance into the court of funky royalty. +music
Perhaps the Finest Blaxploitation Soundtrack Ever+P+If you are at all impressed with Mayfield's Superfly, give Black Caesar a listen.  This album has it all- heavy hitting chunks of funk like Down and Out in New York City to the laid back pimpin' sounds of Blind Man Can See It.  Keep in mind that this album was released within months of the ground breaking Big Payback.  Buy this album, then buy Slaughter's Big Rip Off.  You won't be disappointed+music
Songs that never made it+N+This CD should be named &quot;Songs That Never Made It&quot;. Except for 2 tracks (Jump and Heavan Knows),which are available on other volumes, the songs on this CD are all unknowns for a very good reason. It would be  interesting to know the names of the DJ's who thought these were their  &quot;Favorite Pix&quot;+music
A very good Soundtrack of a very cool Movie!+P+As said in the title, Strange Days is one of the best movies ever and the Soundtrack is really part of it. There is music through the whole film that is very important. It's there to show the viewers all the different emotions the characters have. Juliette Lewis who is actually an actress sings a song called 'Hardly Wait'- it's a Metal Song which is very angry and very cool. Jeriko One- the black rapper who was shot in the movie and who actually the whole film's about (and who's also just an actor) appears with 'hereWEcome'- a rap song which tells the struggle and pain colored people had and still have to go through. It's a very powerful song! Skunk Anansie have two great Metal songs like Strange Fruit who also appear with a Metal song called 'No White Clouds'- one of the coolest I've ever heard! The group Prong made a Metal cover of the Door's 'Strange Days' which is respectful to the original and very cool. The Dance song from Peter Gabriel and Deep Forest is great- just like Sachel's 'Walk in Freedom' which is very beautyful. In short words;-) I love this album and I know you'd like it too- it's really worth to buy+music
At the Core of a singer-songwriter+N+This album finds Billy Joel at the dawn of the superstardom to come.  There are a number of songs that could very well have been hits had this album been released after he had been internationally established with The Stranger and 42nd St.  Notably - Miami 2017, Summer Highland Falls, and New York State of Mind are album-cut classics and are as good as anything he had written before or since.  For those fans who were introduced to Billy Joel through Just The Way You Are, and the rest of The Stranger album, Turnstiles is well worth the purchase to discover a prior album of equal weight and substance+music
buena idea, sin concretar. No merece  el nombre&quot;Brasilero&quot;+N+este cd  intenta ser una introduccion en la variada musica de brasil.Los interpretes varian de famosos a ignotos. Los temas  distan de ser los mejores de cada uno .  podemos acceder a diferentes ritmos ,y  nuevas voces que son  dificiles de encontrar : nazare pereira,sylvia torres o conocer a otros chico cesar, zeca baleiro,etc. Es  muy desparejo en la calidad musical, y no permite apreciar  la riqueza  de los diferentes ritmos e interpretes. Las ausencias son notorias, pero es inevitable,en la amplia musica de brasil. No es un gran cd, solo nos aproxima, no transmite la riqueza musical enorme de ese pais y`para el que no conoce puede darle una imagen deslucida y erronea+music
A step backwards+N+I liked the first two afterhours compilations, mostly because they are so downbeat and emotional. There was a concept in those albums. Now global underground (In my point of view, a very unrespectable company or "label") gave the opportunity to amateur computer-music geeks to become a part of what was a fine series of compilations (and good compilations are so hard to find) without using any criteria.  There is a lack of criteria also at choosing unrepresentative tracks by major artists like Cinematic Orchestra and gusgus. Two stars, because I only like no more than four songs. And they're no big deal at all. +music
Heavy Metal Machine Music+P+The intricate, extensive and sublimely rocking introduction to "Sweet Jane" which opens ROCK & ROLL ANIMAL must have made many of this album's earliest buyers think they'd fallen victim to a record company foul-up. Surely the soaring guitars, thundering bass and tight, swirling drums with which they were confronted couldn't have had anything to do with Lou Reed, legendarily laconic purveyor of atonal drones and decadent, rambling anecdotes. But sure enough, after three and a half minutes all that virtuosic showboating somehow morphed into the beloved Velvet Underground classic, with Reed tossing off his lines in a voice by turns sardonic, indifferent and haunted. The result was, and still is, an album both the hardcore Reed fan and the Reed-hating hard rocker can dig, an eminently successful experiment in classic seventies metal from a man whose prior recordings had firmly established him at the opposite pole of the sonic spectrum.    In truth, however, ANIMAL is less a Lou Reed album than an album of Lou Reed songs as (stunningly) interpreted by what was then Alice Cooper's touring band. The leader's presence here, while significant in establishing the requisite dark, dissipated and druggy ambience, is ultimately more counterpoint than fulcrum. Instead, it's the beautiful picking of guitarists Steve Hunter and Dick Wagner, Ray Colcord's nightmarish organ runs and the stop-on-a-dime interplay of bassist Prakash John and drummer Pentti Glan that are the real story, offering up post-Allman Brothers reinventions of Velvets nuggets like "Heroin," "White Light, White Heat" and "Rock & Roll" as well as several tracks from Reed's outrageously underrated BERLIN LP. What starts out looking like the most awkward of musical marriages ends up being one of rock's all-time greatest live albums, its dynamism literally unflagging from one end to the other. Recommended for...well, you+music
From Nantucket to PKM to Cry of Love...the best rock bands in NC's History+P+In the 70's you had Nantucket, the 1980's had PKM & the 1990's had Cry of Love.  All share a page in NC's rock and roll history and Pee Wee Watson played part in all.  This is the rock and roll tree of North Carolina.  I loved them all and want to thank them for the memories.  I recommend all their albums to any.  You can still get Nantucket's albums and this one from Cry of Love, but unfortunately you can't find PKM's "Rock Erotica".  Maybe one day!  I want to thank Kenny Soule, Pee Wee Watson, Michael Gardner, Audley Freed & Robert Kearns for some great memories.  Daryl Boyette (formerly of WKNS & WSFL radio+music
The Goddess of Euro Dance+P+Easily put,one of the best dance albums ever released.Alice has left a trail for all other dance dj's to follow.If you listen to today's stuff like Lasgo,4 Strings,etc....you will notice the similarities in the music.This album is brilliant and leaves nothing to be desired,providing hella energy and mega emotions.Although released in 2000,it's still at the top of my list.You need to hurry up and get this dance fans+music
Buyer beware+N+I am totally discusted with this CD. I bought it for one song &quot;The  Birth of the Beat&quot; - A wonderful 10 minute performance. When I played  it, I found out it was a cut down version (3 minutes). Needless to say, I  am extremely disappointed+music
Not that Great+N+It reminds me of uthanizm. I did not like it. Theres no hard songs. I'm a die hard Lynch fan. If I your not down with uthanizm don't buy it. Its a dissapointment. I think +music
Not A Great Performance+N+As a long-time fan of Mountain, I found this set to be far less than satisfactory.  Leslie West and Felix Pappalardi are here, but Corky Laing and Steve Knight are absent, replaced by Bob Mann and Alan Schwartzberg, neither of whom plays well.  Mann's guitar/keyboard work is surpassed in its awfulness only by Schwartzberg's drumming, which is simply dreadful.  However, no one in this lineup appears to have any real enthusiasm, slogging through one ragged number after another.  The version of &quot;Nantucket Sleighride&quot; is so long that it soon becomes an exercise in pure tedium; it's a wonder that anyone in the audience was able to stay awake all the way through.  None of the other cuts on this album is much better; in fact, the highlight is the moment during Leslie's &quot;Guitar Solo&quot; when a speaker blows; the rest of the album merely blows.  This entire set sounds like a contractual obligation, and nothing more+music
On the way to Graceland...+P+I took my wife and parents to the Grand Ole Opry in October 2003, just after this album was released. RLH sang two songs, a funny one about breaking up with a boyfried and "Forgive". When she belted out that ballad, I turned to my wife and said, "She's gonna be a huge star one day." After the show, of course, we stopped in the gift shop and grabbed the CD. Good stuff.+music
A BIG dissapointment from a BIG Olivia Fan+N+She has one of the most beautiful voices, and is one of my all-time favorite female singers.  This album is terrible though.  Unlike Agnetha Faltskog, K.D. Lang, and Alison Moyet, who (in my humble opinion)succeeded recently with their "cover" albums (made-up of some of their favorite songs from the past), Olivia does not succeed in the choice of songs, production, and style of singing these+music
SHEP FIELDS,VOL2+P+I've always enjoyed Shep Fields orchestra. This CD is an excellent review of the music heard back in the early 40's.Vocalist Hal Derwin's liner notes tell the whole story of the Fields band.Some remarkably good accordion work by Caesar Muzzioli with this band. Worthwhile listening+music
The plague, the plague!!!!!+P+This movie is hilarious. If you need just one [outrageous] musical comedy for your collection... this is it. Zero Mostel and Phil Silvers are fantastic. The entire cast really gets into the plot. You'll be singing and dancing soon enough+music
sheer brilliance+P+I love a lot of Kiwi alt rock bands, and while the Chills may not be my favorites (that would have to be the wonderful band The Clean), this is, nevertheless, a wonderful, brilliant record. Filled with quirky details and loaded with charm and appeal, this is what great rock music sounds like, and it's the best recording by this talented band. It also has one of the catchiest pop-rock songs ever written, the amazing I Love My Leather Jacket.  I only wish Kaleidoscope World were still available for purchase. I also wish the Chills would consider a U.S. tour, but alas, they seem content to stick around their home country and to play only the occasional show+music
great talent combined+P+I BOUGHT THE CD 4/YRS AGO;IT SOUNDED GREAT THEN AND IT STILL SOUNDS GOOD TODAY.SUCH GREAT TALENT FOR A FATHER AND SON.I ENJOY  EVERY SONG THATS ON THE CD,BUT THEN I LIKE EDDIE AND GERALD LEVERT WHETHER THEY ARE SINGING SOLO OR TOGETHER/+music
Great Music &amp; Performances, Disappointing CD+N+I must agree with the previous reviewer, who found this CD 'lacking in grandeur'. The vocal performances and music are meticulously crafted and delivered, and may indeed be true to the spirit of the period in which they were written. But they are curiously lightweight, and I felt like I was listening to musical fluff. &quot;Jesu Joy of Man's Desiring&quot;--in my opinion, the most moving of all the cantatas--was far too fast-paced: it sounded distressingly like the Minute Waltz. &quot;Sleepers Awake&quot; received similar treatment. Professionally, all of the performers on this CD undoubtedly delivered, but what they delivered was curiously lacking in the soul-stirring majesty that Bach's cantatas can evoke+music
Noise, yes. Ambient or art, no.+N+Eeyucch. Sounds like being stuck waiting for someone in the lobby of a Vegas hotel while the housekeeping staff is cleaning up in the background. Oh look, isn't that Wayne Newton over there+music
Nice Album Cover Watered down Album+N+Album Covers kept on the Right path for the Players but the Music just kept taken a Beaten.Billy Beck is cool on certain songs&there are some moments here&there but Compared to there Hey Day this is like a Watered Down Version of the Band.some of the music is alright but there isn't any stand-out material+music
INCREDIBLE!+P+This has pretty much summed up my own life story in Mark's great use of symphonic music intertwined with his brilliant fiddling dexterosity.  I highly recommend this selection--it is the story of his life put to music.   I know him personally+music
Bonus DVD worth price alone+P+Some great reworkings of old classics, some obscure tracks made easier to obtain, and a bonus DVD documentary containing interviews with Dylan Carlson and European live footage. For the cost, a really great deal.  If you're not familiar with Earth's music, this might be a good starting place, if only to hear Dylan Carlson speak of his influences and motives behind curating such a band as this.  If you're already a fan, you won't be disappointed. The packaging is a bit generic, simple jewel case style with minimal text in booklet similar to many other Earth releases, but the music really shines as always. +music
I'll trade that &quot;o&quot; for an &quot;i&quot;, please...+N+Wanna torture me? Make me listen to one more cowboy shirted ex-punk rocker mangling their way through the Hank Williams or Johnny Cash songbook. Get a buncha Art Institute of Chicago students together, buy some cowboy shirts, overalls, etc. and call yourselves Moonshine Trailer or something, sing in a WIDE affected voice and flail on banjos, mandolins that you can't play and sing about whiskey stills, prison and stuff you don't know nothing about. Welcome to the world of Bloodsh-t Records. A buddy of mine said that ten years ago the owners of this label would spin records at a punk club and they had something like three country records: Dwight Yoakam, some Gram Parsons record and something else...the title escapes me. BS Records must die+music
Interesting Experiment+N+The quality of the recording is awful, which is not necessarily the weakest point of the album, as a matter of fact it lends aa appealing dusted, kitch effect to the music.  The music seems to have been performed by ... semi-amateurs indulging in a recording session - it might be interesting for psychology students to gage the effects of... induced creativity.  I do not dislike the album, I just think its merits are less musical than not.  Amaon II albums are considerably better+music
Music is great, recording is poor...+P+All the recording quality complaints from others are true.  This CD plays OK with $30 boombox, but not on a serious Hi-Fi. But the music is really better than I thought.  I was thinking French guys are good at love songs, which is absolutely true, but their marching music is even better than the German ones I just got (from the same company called Legacy International).    How bad is the recording?  It seems like the music was played from LP, taped in a dark room, stored for 5 years, and then dumped on CD...  How good is the music?  I still rate it 4 star even for the 0 stat recording+music
Shakedown reaks  :{+N+The Song Shakedown Street is cool,better Live,the rest is garbage,this is there worst album not "Steal your face"even thou it sounds way to sleepy,ask a real Deadhead in your area for a cool recording,my guess is a live recording,please see Grateful Dead movie C/D,that is Garcia playn some Saaweeeet! Guitar, seek the truth and stay free Peace Larry Smith of Saint- Ros+music
Well.... Dunno.....+N+I used to like Tiziano Ferro Songs. His first album was a straight hit in the face, a WOW! Great dinamic songs. 111 was more normal, more calm. But this one is really really slow... He changed his usual pop style for a R&B that doesn't convince a lot.  If you like calm balads or are a fan of Tiziano, then you'll like it, but if you don't.... Better don't buy it+music
Relaxing night music+P+David Lanz has really turned me into a new age music listener and admirer with his graceful and soaring piano pieces. I've never heard piano before that sounds like a living and breathing habitat, and since I've been playing it myself from the age of six I had an even greater appreciation for his art. As a composer he is a genius but he's just as brilliant as a performer. I can hear dark night sky and trees swaying in the wind, a bobbing brook running through a cool fir forest, a big cold orb of the silver moon shining on a grassy field and more through this music.  Nightfall is truly incredible and unforgettable and hearing it for the first time when I was around eleven, burned itself into my mind and I swear it has never left. I grew up listening to New Age music and David Lanz, Michael Jones, Spencer Brewer, Nancy Rumbel and Eric Tingstad just to name a few as their sweet melodies on piano, guitar flutes and other instruments wove a tapestry of sound and color like no other. This album might be short, but each piece brings quality that no quantity can beat and that makes it better than 2 cd sets of New Age or any other music that I got in the past, filled with pieces but not all of them are to my taste.  This album is sweet, dreamy, in places majestic and romantic and above all its filled with gorgeous melodies that make sense, and each one is a gem in my eyes. This has been in my collection for about thirteen years and I love it no matter much time passes between listening. I swear that listening to this really relaxes me, and right now as Im typing, listening to it at work, I forget that Im in a concrete jungle, and instead I feel like Im sitting in a lighthouse with a fireplace burning ( no physically possible I know but still, its cute)  and I feel cozy and happy+music
One of the Greatest Albums of all time! YES, OF ALL TIME!+P+I heard they spent 30,000 to make this album from a producer friend of mine. I BELIEVE IT! This is one of those albums that is almost too good to be true. I mean, its perfect in every way. From the production, to the Musicianship, to the song writing, To the variety.. I mean.. Theres nothing this album doesn't miss. Top notch, to say the least.  As many other reviewers mentioned. These guys were highly underrated and overlooked. Its actually shocking because this has to be the most amazing thing Ive ever put in my CD player. And its a shame but you will probably never hear another band like this in your lifetime. Actually, I can almost guarantee that. What a shame..   This is a MUST HAVE album. If you don't buy it. Your missing out on one of the best CD's to be released in the 90's or of all time for that matter. Yes, its that good!+music
Still Standing+P+When asked, nearly every Oasis fan I know will say that Morning Glory, or Definitely Maybe are Oasis' best albums. While both are very good, I'd have to say that this one is the album I'd have to go with for my personal favorite. Don't Believe The Truth is tied with this one for me.   There's just something here that it seems like Oasis have always been trying to block up with pure attitude and drug-fueled anthems. This is the sober, matured Oasis who are left in the aftermath of their dreams come true, to be rock'n'roll stars, standing on the shoulders of the lives they created, with nowhere to go but down.   Although the band was off drinking and drugs while making this album, ironically it is their most psychedelic and foggy effort. There are some of Oasis's weakest tracks on this one "Put Yer Money Where Yer Mouth Is", and "I Can See A Liar", but there are also some of Oasis's best like "Roll It Over".   Though this is by no means their strongest album, it is by far their most honest, and instrospective work to date. It's the sound of the Gallaghers turning away from rough attitude, and facing life head-on+music
Great Classics with a New Twist+P+This album contains many Christmas favorites masterfully performed by Culbertson, et al.  It is definitely a disc that you will keep spinning all season long to promote the cheer.  His wife Michelle contributes beautifully on the vocals to "Some Children See Him."  I have a lot of Christmas albums in my collection, and I honestly have to say that this is one of the best I have yet to come across.  This is definitely a compilation that the entire family will love.  I highly recommend it to anyone who needs a little pizazz this holiday+music
sneaks up on you+P+i scored this record from the buck bin yesterday. the owner of the shop looked at it like maybe it shouldn't have been in there but sold it to me anyhow. he said i should run home quick and listen to it because james booker is a revelation. right he was - when side one finished i didn't even flip over the record, i just plopped the needle right back at the beginning.   it may just be solo piano and a little singing but the sound is big, beautiful, complex, soulful. one of those rare records that make me kick myself over all the years i spent not listening to it.+music
Hillary Duff has NOTHING to worry about!+N+What a joke.  She can barely sing a note or hold a tune.  Hillary Duff at least has some talent.  Don't waste your money on this dreadfully thin Hollywood has been+music
Wow! (For the most part, anyway)+P+Having had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Haynes live and on disc in several  different contexts, both as leader and sideman, I have developed quite a  love for his  music over the years. He has the unique ability to push the  music to new heights while not drowning out the contribution of his fellow  musicians. So natuarally I was looking forward to this release.I was not  disappointed.Danilo Perez, who brings a wonderful, unique latin flavor to  his playing, seems to be genuinely at ease with the music while still being  quite creative. Plus, he is just very fun to listen to!John Patitucci is a  bass player whos career I have been following ever since his days in the  group Tamarac. His stint with Chick Corea, though, really brought attention  to his very solid playing.Mr. Haynes, of course is electrifying. Playing  rhythems and counter rhythems which would cause most other drummers  nightmares, are totally second nature to him. After all, he has been doing  this for over fifty years.In the end, though, all this great talent would  mean nothing without good tunes for them to create on. On this cd that  means a selection of tried and true standards, with a few more recent works  added in for good measure.The first half of the album consists of studio  recordings while the second deals with live cuts from a stint at  Scullers.Personaly, I prefer the live tunes. The band has a tendency to cut  loose a lttle more and take a few more chances. This, as is often the case,  brings the excitment level up a few notches.All in all, you can't really go  wrong with this cd. Do yourself a favor: pick this one up, pour yourself a  cup of coffee, and prepare to be delighted+music
I was there when they recorded this...+N+I was at Scullers when they recorded the live parts of this album.  There were lots of great moments in that concert...unfortunately, none of them made it onto the album.  It's like they took only the dull parts of the  concert.  The studio portions aren't much better. I'm a huge fan of Danilo  Perez and John Patittucci but this album is really boring+music
cd+P+laura brang died way to young only 47 i like her stuff my freind died from the same thing at 2+music
Firehouse talent...acousticly!+P+One of my favorite cd's!!!  Talent certainly comes out when they can cover an old southern rock hit like 'seven bridges road' and do it so smoothly!  The acoustic guitars rock with rhythm and funk.  I never knew firehouse to be this talented!  It sure shines out in this acoustic compilation of their most remembered hits! Being partial to modern country rock and southern rock...I can't help but be doubly pleased with hearing a steel guitar added to my all time fav. by this band, "love of a lifetime".  This is a must have for any firehouse fan+music
The Song &quot;Crime Of The Century&quot;+N+I Like This Album, Especially The 10th Song &quot;Crime Of The Century&quot;.  This Song Is Fun, And I Like It.  I Typed The Lyrics On My Computer.  In August 2002 I Sang The Song At The Boys And Girls Club Staff Member.  Some Of The Staff Members Like This Song.  I Hope I Will Sing This Song At School If There Is A Talent Show At Schoo+music
A great understanding of Tolkien's world+P+What an amazing album! And who saw it coming? Jon Anderson's work here is the best, but there certainly is other great talent, especially on the last song. Most of the lyrics are in elvish, but there's some in english, too. The only real downpoint is the cover of "Battle Of Evermore" pales in comparison to the original song. All in all, this accompanies Tolkien's work fabulously. One little weak spot keeps it from getting a 5+music
4,5 stars - only a tiny bit worse than New Jersey+P+Bon Jovi is a band that may not be the best one (the best one's were Led Zeppelin, Rolling Stones or Pink Floyd), but their record-sales say otherwise. There is perhaps a grain of truth in the notion that half of their audience were teenagers and women and their sucess was soemwhat overrated, as well as that they went big on Jon Bon Jovi's coiffeur and outlook, though.          Nonetheless, I think they truly deserved their overwhealming breakthrough from the 80's offering people catchy, competent and well-ctrafted pop-rock-metal tunes played on and on by the MTV. All in all, that's how metal sounded in the mid-80's (just take Whitesnake or Def Leppard). Personally, I have always been an advocate of this band, turning a blind eye on what other narrow-minded people kept saying about it. Yes, Bon Jovi has made couple of cheesy songs ("Always") and some both cheesy and too commercial as well ("It's my life"). "It's my life" was a cheap trial to break to the pop-charts, but, if there are any open-minded music passionates there, you will notice that other bands had it as well (Van Halen had "Jump", KISS had "I was made for loving you").  One has to take the band as a whole, and simply can't deny the skillful and well-crafted musicanship of albums like "New Jersey" or "Keep the faith". So, if you are too narrow-minded to rate this, you simply have no right to proclaim yourself a music-passionate or music-knower.         Before "KTF" was released Bon Jovi came into the studio  very motivated and full of energy after a well-deserved 4-year- break that immediately followed the incredible "New Jersey" tour. They had sold out stadiums, giving over 200 concerts all around the world and the tour itself consolidated their position on the music market and confirmed how well they do on-stage. But unfortunately it also put on the brink their common career as a band. "Five different guys took five different planes to five different places. There were no goodbyes" - JBJ once used to say.          No wonder "Keep the faith" was the ultimate, long-awiated album in the 90's and this waiting had 2 major purposes: 1)to finally write off the larger-than-life 80's survivor as a mere, temporary, fashion-yielding hair-band 2)or to prove people that Jon & Richie were in fact much more than "Living on a prayer" and were capable of adopting to the changable 90's music scene (with grunge at the forefront).         For the first group of critics, like the above-underwritten Amazon reviewer Andrew Mueller being sic and tired of Bon Jovi's recent expansion, the very album - no matter how good it might turn out to be - was a blessing so much awaited to prey on, that he boldly, blatantly and with a smirk on his face dismissed even such masterpieces like "Dry county"; and that doing this with a mere wave of a hand, claiming it's "pointless" or "longish". Pathetic indeed, but it shows how much stirr there was once the album has been released.         Fortunately, the CD speaks for itself and proves again that if BJ's star was ever to be thwarted for good - then it should have been done much earlier, namely right after their second "7800 fahrenheit". Ironically enough, their debut album was received very well on both sides of the ocean, and most of the critics that hated "Slippery when wet" (see acclaimed British music magazine "Kerrang") showed much warmth and sympathy towards it.         As far as the second group of people - they once again got a longplay that fully satisfied their crave for tuneful, melodic rock; yet not an ordinary hair-metal this time. Jon knew it well and it wasn't only for his change of haircut. The singalong choruses remained the same, the peculiar BJ-flow that makes people tapping their fingers as well; yet  the album is much more than that, being a lot more mature in terms of lyrics, diversity and overall coherence. If the title song was to become the new "Living on a prayer" and "Bed of roses" a new "I'll be there for you", then OK - it would indicate that a new era for the band has just begun. But if someone ever bought "Slippery when wet" just for 2 songs dismissing the rest, then he/she is not going to do this this time, with this album, I'm telling you.          The epic "Dry county" was reviewed and summarized many times so far, but I don't know if it abides any summary in fact; since this is one of the songs you must hear and relish in it every single time, peruse every single tune, from the very beginning, climaxing with Richie's solo, and fading away with Dave's keyboards. I was on a concert in Germany a month ago ("Have a nice day" tour) and you can't imagine what a surprise it was for me when they played this one at the very end of the show! Whooah, this is one of the moments I will remeber until the end of my life. With tears in your eyes, you live for such moments. "Dry county" is also undoubtedly the most accomplished, advanced and ambitious band's effort, looking at the entire 20-some-years-career.  It is a class for itself, compare this epic to "Stairway to heaven", "Shine on you crazy diamond" or GunsNRoses' "November rain". I wont't exaggerate at all if I say this album is worth having just for this single track, since it is one of the most important songs that have ever been recorded. Let people like Andrew Mueller - with full respect towards his work and criticism - long live they in their blissful oblivion dismissing "Dry county" as "pointless".          But "Keep the faith" is a lot more than "Dry county", I tell you. "If I was your mother", which is my second favourite track here, is a huge bow towards grunge music; "Fear" as well. It clearly shows that guys took into account changing fashions and wrote these two almost-heavy-metal tracks. The "Mother's" riff is incredible, merging Pearl Jam, Nirvana and Guns N Roses. "In these arms" and "I'll sleep when I'm dead" are happy-rockers that can be hummed any time on a party, somewhat reminescent of the recent albums, like "99 in the shade" or something !  "Little bit of soul" and "Blame it on the love of rock n roll" are two very good tracks - yet again in another mood - that close this marvelous album and, merging soul and blues, make a final statement about the incredible diversity "Keep the faith" offers. Of course "Bed of roses" was a huge hit and is arguably their best ballad ever, whereas the title track - being the first single at the same time - made it into the US Top20, is very heavy with incredible Sambora's guitar-solo, and it also smacks somewhat of grunge.            Overall, this is an incredibly miscellanous and diverse record that you won't get bored of... never! The only reason why I'm not giving full 5 stars (but 4,5) is because I've got acquainted with the take-off material from those sessions, and it stirrs the entity for me, I don't know why but somehow it does. It gets my goat that the band not always makes the right choice when it eventually goes to make the final song-selection. Tracks that appeared recently on the jubille "100,000,000 million fans can't be wrong", like "The fire inside", "Sympathy" or "Temptation" really should have made this great album.  Had these great songs been included istead of cheesy ballad "I want you" or mediocre "Woman in love", it could have been one of the greatest and most diverse albums in music history. Probably other Bon Jovi-fans agree with me.         Anyway, this is an incredible album, almost as good as "New Jersey". Only "NJ" didn't have 2 less strong songs, it was almost perfect... well just kidding, OK it had terrible "Bad medicine" ;-))  This is a MUST-HAVE.                       +music
Spectrum too sweet+N+This recording has a lot to answer for, having spawned literally a thousand similar relaxation records. I bought it enthusiastically in the mid-seventies. How has it aged? Not very well, I`m afraid, the passing  years revealing all too well its lack of musical substance. I will not deny  that it may relax children and musically uneducated adults. But I cannot  stomach his pretense that this Western diatonic scale rambling is being  linked to the actual activity of the chakra system. This is the stuff  confusion is made of, and Halpern would deserve more than two stars if he  simply stuck with his ability to compose harmless relaxation pieces, not  calling it music with actual ability to heal+music
What?! No electronics! Hurray!+P+Armaggedon, Gone In 60 Seconds, Enemy of the State, Deep Blue Sea, American Outlaws, National Treasure. Most of these scores are good but all too electonic. Rabin restrains himself from using any electronic instrument on this score. From the get-go, the score sounds like a mix of Saving Private Ryan for the main theme and a hint of The Thin Red Line for the subtle moments.  Its a well done mixture.  "The Rescue" starts off much like the Saving Private Ryan ending with a patriotic brass section. The song greatly displays Rabin's departure from his more recent scores.   Another good track featuring the brassy theme in its entirety is "The Great Raid". The complete theme is not heard on the movie but at least we get it on the album.  There is only one action song and two tense songs. "Raid Begins" is action. "Rangers Start" and "Stealing Medicine" are tense. "The Geat Raid" track is a mixture of both elements since its a bit tense before coming to a tiumphant close to signal the conclusion of the raid.  This score is orchestral, a first for Rabin making this his most challenging. I recommend this score to all drama score lovers.   I also recommend Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers, We Were Soldiers and The Thin Red Line as well+music
Probably the most fun on a Police album+P+I first listened to the two main singles from this album, "Message in a Bottle" and "Walking on the Moon," when I bought the greatest hits album.  "Walking on the Moon" has slowly become my favorite Police song mainly for its simplistic yet hypnotic rhythm and its quirky yet intriguing lyrics.  I had heard the track "The Bed's Too Big Without You" some time later, and I decided to buy this album.  The same time, I bought Synchronicity, being as that is their final proper album and had some great tracks on it.  The funny thing is this: I found Synchronicity to be a let-down and Regatta de Blanc to be a triumph. The key to this whole album is what the title of is means: White Reggae.  With a heavy influence of reggae, all of the songs come together in a nice fashion.  The lyrics have some bite to it and the music can be fierce when it needs to be, but the Police finally sit back and develop intricate rhythms too all of their songs.  Sting said that he used the spacious reggae bass style because it gave him room to sing, and it absolutely shows here.  He beats the hell out of UB40 when it comes to white reggae singing.  His voice is absolutely unique, a true instrument rather than just a voice.  Summers develops a cool, collected style of guitar, loud when it needs to be, but never too flashy.  Copeland encompasses everything and becomes one of the greatest drummers to walk the planet.  Nothing shows that cohesion more than the instrumental title track, and it deservedly won a Grammy for Best Rock Instrumental Performance.  That track sums up the album very nicely: a straight rock album with the intricacies of reggae, and it stands just underneath Zenyatta Mondatta as the best of the Police+music
A Revelation!+P+I thought I was taking a bit of chance buying this cd, as I was only familiar with the classics "For Your Love" and "Heart Full of Soul", but I was on a British Invasion kick.  Wow!  This cd like, blew me away, man.  For only one surprise, I was delighted to discover "Shapes of Things" - a great tune I certainly remembered, but never knew its name or its YB origin.  The only other piece I sort of recall was "The Train Kept A-Rollin" which was featured in re-worked form in the Antonioni film "Blow Up". This, and the rest that was completely new to me, I just love:  "Evil Hearted You" and "Mr. You're a Better Man Than I" are two others I find buzzing through my head throughout the day.  Even if I'm a tad less patient with live stuff, which can veer into show-offy, formless indulgence, these guys can pull it off, as I find myself digging that fuzz-guitar/feedback rave-up (plus they know enough not to go on forever).  I'll most definitely look into this band further - their music and their story.  Enthusiastically recommended to anyone with any curiousity about this band+music
Egotistical Blowhard+N+I went to see Mato's reinvented Indigenous 2 nights ago with high expectations. I have been a fan and seen him many times with the family members that he has since DUMPED because someone got him to believe they weren't good enough. The sound mix was so BAD it was painful to my ears, it physically hurt. Mato came off so look-at-me egotistical it would have been laughable if it wasn't so offensive. New band members - nothing special, certainly no great improvement from his family which he obviously does not understand was a portion of his band's original appeal. I walked out on a 15 dollar ticket to save my ears. In the past couple days I have visited with a few people and they ALL said the same word "DISAPPOINTING".  In summation - I highly recommend the early Indigenous recordings. I strongly advise you to AVOID the new and supposedly improved "Mato" and any new recordings. Hopefully he will come back down to earth and rediscover his roots but I doubt it. I gave 1 star only because the review format forced me to+music
Makes you want to get up and DANCE!+P+My first Zydeco experience took place a few years ago when Queen Ida visited the Twin Cities.  I made my first trip to New Orleans this Spring and purchased Putumayo Presents: Zydeco at a local music store.

Useful info in buying Karaoke CD's+N+I host a Karaoke show in Nashville. I have never bought Disney Karaoke CD's. However, I will offer you one tip. A lot of people are mislead by &quot;Karaoke Cd&quot;. Always read on the disc and make sure it says CD+G on it. I bought some  Chartbuster Karaoke CD's that were on clearance for 2.99 each. I thought I had a deal. It was just that-a CD and not a CD+G (Compact disc + graphics). Fortunatly, they took them back and refunded my money. Karaoke CD's are usually just background music+music
I like Todd+P+but I'm baffled by this CD.  The first track listed is "Elmo and Henry", but track 1 is just some short, faint instrumental.  The lyrics to "Elmo and Henry" are in the CD liner, but no such song on the CD.  Also, the liner contains lyrics to two songs titled "Dance, Dance, Dance" and "Promises to Keep", but again, no such songs on the CD.  What is on the CD are some pretty cool songs by a talented wordsmith and musician.  I highly recommend it!  Just can't make sense of what's in the liner and what is and isn't on the actual CD+music
Sophisticated Funk+P+This was my introduction to T.O.P. and it gradually became a collection of undiscovered classics for me personally. This brand of big & intricate funk really grows on you. If you haven't bought a copy yet, go ahead and "Knock Yourself Out.+music
TRULY A SENSATIONAL PIECE!+P+This music makes you want to get up and dance! The first few tracks are the best, but the whole CD is very good. I could not stop listening to son fro by africando and many more. Hide this CD because once you pop it in, your friends will never want to give it back to you. After owning gypsy caravan, afro-latino, afro latin party, salsa around the world, cuba and many more i have come to say that this is one of the best putumayo we have seen up to date. Also check out putumayo colombia-It is sure to get you dancing like you have never danced before!+music
The luster left before this album+N+I am amazed that this album has gotten such good reviews here.  This starts Kim's long descent into his boogie demise.  If you want to hear Savoy Brown at their finest and the music that gave them their acclaim, buy "Looking In" and "Raw Sienna".  If you like the blues side of their music get "Blue Matter".  But by the time this album came out, the magic was gone+music
&quot;Why&quot; you ask?+N+Because most everybody wanted to stick a dirty sock down Eric Burdon's mouth, that's why.

As good as it gets for Old Blue Eyes!+P+How could you not love this whole set? There are swinging tunes and there are those beautiful love songs. The last cut, ...

So deserved to win Last Comic Standing!+P+This guy is amazingly funny!  I saw him live last week and I laughed my ass off!  Go see him if you can and buy his CD.  He's alot funnier (& dirtier) than you saw on Last Comic Standing.  Gary Gulman is good but Alonzo has the goods+music
Don't buy the Century Media version!!!!+N+An excellent release .... just don't buy this version. The Century Media release with the Bonus Tracks contains audio that appears to have gone through some kind of lossy audio encoding process (i.e. encoded to MP3 then back to PCM) before being sent to the manufacturing plant.  Avoid this one, check out the other versions and make sure you receive the full audio spectrum that you paid for.+music
Paleolithic  Boogie+N+Paleolithic Jarre fare of toe stompin synthesizer anthems.  With no concept of sublime codification.  Heroic calculated in your face arrangements leave a relatively transient impression.  Electric boogie ala francais+music
Misunderstood+P+Not sure what everyone else is upset about. Either you like Collective Soul or you don't. I LOVE this album. It's not a new release in that it's mostly unplugged music. It's without all the bells and whistles and it's still great. I think if you just like CS for their 'Music' you won't like this CD, but if you like them for who they are and their lyrics, it's a great CD. If you want a compilation of greatest hits, try 7 Year Itch, if you want the grass roots, From the Ground Up is for you.   IMH+music
Another remarkable album+P+Ignore the previous reviewer because it is full of clarical errors.  First off, Houdini was released in 1993, NOT 1995. I don't understand this rambling about the Melvins going downhill in 1995 starting with Houdini. Kurt Cobain was the one who helped the Melvins get on a major label (Atlantic) and it lasted for three albums before they were decided as being too nontradtional and not mainstream accessible. Houdini, Stoner Witch and Stag comprise this era, and all are fine albums worth owning with perhaps Stag being the most unconventional of the three.  I don't get how anyone could be critical of the Melvins, because as a whole, they have an impressive body of work that is always expanding and doesn't get pigeon holed in any preconceived notions of genre or labels. Also to dismiss "what ever they have done in the last ten years" without even bothering to listen to it is just plain ignorant. To recap: all Melvins albums are worth owning if you give them a chance  The post 1995 work includes  Honky (1997) The Magggot (1999) The Bootlicker (1999) The Crybaby (2000) Electroretard (2001) The Collusus of Destiny (2001) Hostile Ambient Takeover (2002) The Pigs of the Roman Empire (2004)  And yes even the most recent album with Jello Biafra is worth picking up. Enjoy+music
bor-ring+N+After first buying WR's "Heavy Weather" I'd have to say that this album really disappointed me. Now it does have it's moments(nubian sundance), but all in all, I'm just not feeling this one.I didn't like the sound quality...but it wasnt all about that though. As opposed to "Heavy Weather" Songs like "Cucumber slumber" sound dated...Kinda puts me in the mind of a bad 70's blaxploitation movie, while other songs just plain put me to sleep. Basically it just doesn't have that funky/rock/jazzy sound that Jaco Pastorius brought to the mix.+music
Most bands would give their left arm for an album as good as this+P+This 4th Band album has gotten a bad rap over the years. Only because the first 3 were so legendary. I tell you what, do yourself a favor and listen to this album again, I was amazed how good it really is. With songs like The River Hymm, Life Is A Carnival, Moon Struck One, Shoot Out in Chinatown an dthe underrated Volcano, it's an album most bands would die for to make.  +music
Welcome New Additions+P+The new songs in this cd are great additions to the long list of popular Christmas songs. These tracks will endure like the rest of the good ones, and it's well worth getting for your Christmas collection!+music
Journey; Pre-Commercialization+P+These recordings are Journey to me. I was dissappointed when there music took a turn that seemed to represent a desire to make money which exceeded their desire to make music. I am elated to have found this "album". It showcases the genius, soul and spirit which went into their music during that era. +music
missing many songs from the film+N+A soundtrack gets its power from the combination of images with the song. There were a lot of great songs from the movie yet they are not on this lame soundtrack. The soundtrack is okay, the best songs are from Sheryl Crow and Hootie but the songs that are most memorable from the film are missing. I understand that there were probably licensing issues precluding use but that is what makes the soundtrack good...to re-live the euphoria from the film+music
Photek's Masterpiece+P+this is all photek was on his debut, "Modus Operandi", but with some dressing added, if you will. while photek is known for Drum n' Bass, there are 2 house tracks and one ambient track on here that are very worthwhile. The opening track, Terminus starts off with beats like none other and by the time it reaches full swing, youll find yourself wanting more. also be sure to check out the house track Mine to Give featuring the awesome voice of Robert Owens. the title track, Solaris is perfect in every way, and is a real chill out song on a great chill out album which is a necessity for those long trips where you have nothing to do and just feel like tuning out to everything around you. Solaris by Photek is sure to open up new worlds for fans old and ne+music
"-I- AM SPOCK-TACUS!"+N+You can bet that if Peter David had lifted a cliche as hoary as the "I am Spartacus" moment for one of his stories, he would have at least given a nod to his source! Spock as messiah became fairly tedious, as did the rehash of 'old codger from OST becoming a liability and then proving himself' plot line from RELICS. Dry, humorless, with action scenes that lead nowhere and a seemingly superficial grasp on what makes the characters tick. I just don't get why Mr. Friedman is so popular. I've been so pleased with the overall improvement in the ST fiction offerings in the last few years - Kevin Ryan, Peter David, Greg Cox and others have all been able to incorporate and expand the dimensions of the trek universe with wit, heart and intelligence. Like another reviewer here, I keep trying to like this author's books since he is so prolific, but damn it, Jim, Star Trek fiction should never be a chore+music
Public Enemy+P+This was always one of my favorite albums/tapes & I wanted the CD.  IT is in great condition.  Thanks so muc+music
A Handel Don't+N+My initial reaction on hearing this recording was to deaccession it at once. On better thought, I decided to hold onto it as a striking example of how NOT to sing the music of Handel. Nothing works here: the garbled coloratura, the inept dynamics, the cardboard emotions, the lack of arc. The performances convey no hint of sensitivity. Ms. Fleming's warm voice has been much better deployed in other repertory, like Strauss. But this won't do.  Perhaps more distressing than the singing itself is the rabid loyalty of the Flemingites, who obviously consider this singer to be the Second Coming of Callas. This is a discredit to the singer herself, who has remarkable talent and poise and has no need of mindless fans to protect her from her mistakes.  To the fledgling singers who admire this recording so much, I would urge a broader scope. A future of Handelian singing in this mold is a very discouraging prospect indeed+music
Nuno's guitar work is very impressive+P+This album beats out a more negative vibe than any of Extremes others, but that doesn't mean that its not enjoyable. The real attraction towards the sound of this album is in the guitar work of Nuno Bettencourt.  The intricate rhythms of the guitar solos, made possible by Nuno's shredding abilities, are magic.  In some ways I feel his sound bluesy, with an influence of Hendrix.  I wouldn't recommend this to someone who it buying their first extreme album, a more rewarding buy would be the best of Extreme: an accidental collication of atoms.  I would recommend it to someone looking to expand their Extreme collection however.  Particularly impressive songs are Midnight Express, where Nuno shows off his incredible speed on a steel string acoustic, and Hip Today, the guitar solo of which still blows my mind.  Also worth mentioning is cynical f***, which isn't as technically impressive but an enjoyable hard rocking song none the less+music
The Worst of Extreme+N+You'd think that after releasing 3 albums, these guys would have honed their craft.  Sadly, this album is their worst release.  Seems they tried to strip the sound back a bit on this album, fewer guitar overdubs being the obvious change.  This album sounds a bit empty to me, I preferred the fuller sound of their earlier releases.  The first 3 albums are great.  Being a fan of Nuno Bettencourt, I'd also recommend the first Mourning Widows album (the second one is not quite as good)+music
ANOTHER GREAT LIVE COMPILATION BY HENDRIX'S "BAND OF GYPSYS!"+P+I will be doing a review on the legendary historic landmark 2-CD live compilation set entitled "Jimi Hendrix - Band Of Gypsys - Live At The Fillmore East" by the late great guitar legend Jimi Hendrix. As always, I will be editing this review from time to time so that you the consumer will get the best and most accurate review possible. In case you haven't read my previous review on the "Band Of Gypsys" DVD documentary, this is actually a continuation review of the "Band Of Gypsys" saga, this time focusing and highlighting on some of Jimi's unreleased song performances that were performed "Live At The Fillmore East" on 31 December 1969 and 1 January 1970. This latest 2-CD set, like the DVD documentary, were both separately released in 1999 and includes additional unreleased song performances that were not included in the original partial six song live compilation released in 1970 entitled "Hendrix - Band Of Gypsys." In case you don't remember, there was another live compilation (a sequel) of additional unreleased performances that was released by Capitol Records on vinyl and cassette in 1986, but not on CD, entitled "Jimi Hendrix - Band Of Gypsys 2."   With this new latest 1999 2-CD live compilation collection, along with the original 1970 and the then latest 1986 collection, these new unreleased performances shed a new light in the "Band Of Gypsys" saga and legacy resulting in bringing these partial Fillmore East concerts to life. With this being fact, these newly released performances add much more to the "Band Of Gypsys" legend and is clearly becoming more evident of being a truer testament in showing the further advancement of the band's fully creative side while performing live, in how mixing and combining Rock n' Roll, Soul, R&B, Blues and Funk can result in a new powerfully explosive sound of music.  Before I go any further, I would like to go way back to the beginning. In my DVD documentary review, I have stressed many contributing factors on the ideas and beginnings resulting in the birth and formation of the "Band Of Gypsys," along with the many contributing factors and incidents that would fatally prove disastrous and eventually break up the "Band Of Gypsys." In this latest 2-CD release, I will go further and stress another important contributing factor that was not discussed in my previous DVD documentary review. This is another one of many contributing factors that would result in the birth of the "Band Of Gypsys."  According to numerous Hendrix biographies and the attached liner booklet that accompanied this 2-CD live compilation set, the genesis, the root of the beginning that started all of this actually evolved from a serious problem Jimi neglected which began back in 1965. In 1965, Jimi was then, a typical hungry musician, who would sign any contract or any piece of paper in hopes that it would further advance his career. Having signed numerous contracts and many pieces of paper to many, unfortunately, for Jimi, there was one piece of paper that Jimi signed that would haunt him after he became famous. Since Jimi did not fulfill his obligations with this particular company, as was the case for the many others Jimi forgot about, the plaintiff's and attorneys representing this opposing company would file a lawsuit against Jimi demanding satisfaction. With this lawsuit pending, Jimi figured that the only way to resolve and settle this lawsuit was to give them something that would satisfy and resolve this issue. With this in mind, Jimi would contact and approach his long time friend and Army buddy named Billy Cox and explained what had happened. It was at this point, when it was decided by Jimi to settle out of court by giving the company plantiff's a new studio album recording for them to release. Cox's reply to this statement was, "lets go for it!" Also during this time, while Hendrix and Cox were discussing these matters further into details, and Jimi's Drummer Mitch Mitchell taking a break in England, Buddy Miles was a frequent visitor as well as a spectator in the studios with Jimi and Billy. When Miles was told about Jimi's misfortunes and his circumstances surrounding his situation, Miles decided the same fate and results as Billy. Miles reply was, "lets help our friend in need." With Jimi sharing and explaining his new ideas for a new sound with Cox and Miles, the two would agree on liking Jimi's new ideas and would help in fulfilling these goals by playing a mixture and a combination of Rock n' Roll, Soul, R&B, Blues and Funk. With these new goals and the stage now being set, this newly born trio would eventually become known as, the "Band Of Gypsys." With Cox's and Miles' full cooperation and their loyalty to Jimi, Jimi now felt a little at ease and believed that a resolution would soon be in the works in his legal matter.  In order to create this ultimate new sound for this new album, Jimi elected in preparing fresh new original material. Jimi really wanted to record these fresh new original songs in the studio for the sole purpose, and hopes, of fulfilling his legal obligations to this company by giving them a new studio album recording for them to release, and resolve and close this legal matter. But with the Fillmore East shows coming up, preparations such as practicing and rehearsing the new song material as well as the familiar songs for the upcoming shows, and with little time remaining, would soon become the main priority resulting in the postponement of the studio recordings of the new songs and therefore, laid aside.   With Jimi and his Management being harassed and subjected to increasing pressure from the company plaintiff's attorneys, in order to satisfy the Capitol / PPX settlement, a new decision was made by Jimi's Manager Mike Jeffery to record all four of the forthcoming Live Fillmore East Concert Performances. This decision was rendered in hopes of releasing a live compilation album rather than a studio album. With all of this in mind, and showtime about to commence, ALL FOUR concert performances spanning two evenings, were recorded onto tape on 31 December 1969 and 1 January 1970. Sadly, these 2-CD live compilation performances contain only sixteen of the many numerous songs that were performed in those four shows. However, it is also evident that these sixteen live song tracks do clearly audibly indicate and show the brilliance and expertise of some of the new genuine original and well-performed song material besides the regularly well known popular Hendrix songs. These sixteen live song tracks sounded EXCELLENT! The sixteen live song tracks contained and listed in this 2-CD live compilation set are reviewed as follows: DISC 1 (1.) "Stone Free," (1 January 1970, second show) (EXCELLENT SONG!) (2.) "Power Of Soul," (1 January 1970, first show) (EXCELLENT SONG!) (3.) "Hear My Train A Comin'," (31 December 1969, first show) (EXCELLENT WELL PERFORMED slow blues song!) (4.) "Izabella," (31 December 1969, first show) (EXCELLENT SONG!) (5.) "Machine Gun," (1 January 1970, second show) (one of the very first live recordings of this legendary song. It is a POWERFUL and EXPLOSIVE song WELL PERFORMED! EXCELLENT! OUTSTANDING! As I've stressed in my other past reviews concerning this legendary song, I've described this song in this manner; "Jimi actually presents and brings the Vietnam war to the Fillmore East audience crowd resulting in firing rounds of machine gun bullets through his powerfully explosive and violent guitar and ending with an EXCELLENT BREATHTAKING GUITAR SOLO from Jimi.") (6.) "Voodoo Child" (Slight Return) (1 January 1970, second show) (an EXCELLENT VERSION of one of my favorites) and (7.) "We Gotta Live Together." (1 January 1970, second show) (EXCELLENT SONG! WELL PERFORMED!) DISC 2 (1.) "Auld Lang Syne," (31 December 1969, second show) (Well performed the Jimi Hendrix and "Band Of Gypsys" way) (2.) "Who Knows," (31 December 1969, first show) (EXCELLENT! OUTSTANDING! GREAT SONG!) (3.) "Changes," (31 December 1969, first show) (EXCELLENT SONG!) (4.) "Machine Gun," (31 December 1969, second show) (another EXCELLENT WELL PERFORMED VERSION. Refer to DISC 1 for my review of the other version of "Machine Gun." My opinions of these two songs are the same. This version is also EXCELLENT! OUTSTANDING!) (5.) "Stepping Stone," (1 January 1970, first show) (EXCELLENT SONG!) (6.) "Stop," (1 January 1970, first show) (another EXCELLENT SONG!) (7.) "Earth Blues," (1 January 1970, second show) (another EXCELLENT SONG!) (8.) "Burning Desire" (1 January 1970, first show) (EXCELLENT SONG!) and (9.) "Wild Thing." (1 January 1970, second show) (the Troggs classic song performed the Hendrix and "Band Of Gypsys" way. an EXCELLENT WELL PERFORMED VERSION!)  As story has it, and according to the attached CD liner notes and numerous Hendrix biographies, Technical problems RUINED the two New Years Eve concerts. A malfunctioning microphone at the outset of the first show rendered energetic versions of "Power Of Soul" and "Lover Man" UNUSABLE. Similar problems hampered the start of the second concert set, compromising the fidelity of the "Auld Lang Syne / Who Knows" medley. Nonetheless, these minor trifles made little impact on Jimi and the "Band Of Gypsys."  In closing, My DVD documentary review stressed on the MANY main incidents and problems that resulted in disasters and the MANY contributing factors which would lead Jimi into a deep depression and therefore, begin his demise and decline of his health. Sadly, the "Band Of Gypsys" era would prove to be , SHORT LIVED, courtesy of the EVIL CROOKED PLOTTED SCHEMES of Jimi's Manager, Mike Jeffery. It may have also been at this point; (despite all of the incidents and disasters that unfolded in the past, the most recent and the MANY NUMEROUS ones STILL TO COME) that bitter tensions and bad differences would develop, intensify and continually worsen the relationship between Hendrix and Jeffery. Despite all of the tensions and disasters, Jimi Hendrix IS STILL UNDOUBTEDLY, THE GREATEST GUITARIST THAT EVER LIVED. Also, despite being held back and limiting his masterful creativity by Jeffery, Jimi STILL PERFORMED AND PLAYED HIS GUITAR AT A PEAK UNMATCHED BY MANY OF THE GREAT GUITAR LEGENDS. Jimi Hendrix is quite simply, EXTREMELY RARE, UNIQUE AND IRREPLACEABLE. Jimi Hendrix's mark in Rock n' Roll history is FOREVER SECURED. There will NEVER be another Jimi Hendrix. Thanks for your time in reading my long lengthy review and I hope you enjoyed reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it for all of you. I also hope that you will read all of my other reviews in the near future when time permits. JIMI LIVES! LONG LIVE ROCK N' ROLL! Rock out always. Take care, J.L.                                 +music
The Sound Quality Really Bugs Me+N+This is a good intro CD to famous piano pieces.  However, the sound quality is really *poor*.  Of course, what do you expect for the price?  I'm sure there are better Piano Sample CDs out there that sound much better.  It's worth the extra money, trust me+music
Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.......+N+I remember reading about this album in Rolling Stone.  It had 2 stickers on it.  It had the usual "parental advisory" sticker (is there a rap album that doesn't) and another one saying "the lyrical content on this album strictly represents the views of the artist" (or words to that effect).  The article's main point was asking "are albums going to get two labels now?  What's next?".  So, my "I hate censorship" side got all flustered, and I went out and bought it.  It's a piece of s--t.  The beats are boring, and all the lyrics seem to consist of is "my name MC Eiht.  No one better mess with me".  He pads this wonderfully original thought out to 70 minutes or so, and it gets incredibly tedious.  Needless to say, the sticker "controversy" never erupted into anything beyond this album.  I just ended buying a really boring album, and I immediately got rid of it. +music
Satisfaction Guaranteed+P+Although Radioactive grabbed the headlines back in 85, 86, Satisfaction Guaranteed is the true gem on the album.  It is a terrific song to cover, allows great jamming, and is distinctly Page/Rodgers, a terrific combination (even better than the current Rodgers/May collaboration with Queen).  If you haven't heard it in awhile, you may be surprised.  Not dated, either+music
VOTED THE GREATEST INSTRUMENTAL ALBUM OF ALL-TIME!+P+I will be doing a review on the legendary masterpiece CD album entitled "ARE YOU EXPERIENCED?" by the late great guitar legend, the one and only Jimi Hendrix. This CD album was originally released on vinyl in 1967 on Jimi's old Reprise Records label affiliated with Warner Brothers and once owned by the late great Frank Sinatra. I own three (3) different versions of this album on CD and the matrix or ID numbers are as follows: 825 416-2, 6261-2 and MCAD-10893. Two of the three CD's I own are definitely COLLECTOR'S ITEMS which I will NEVER SELL. If I hear or read any new information concerning this legendary album, I will edit this review so that you the consumer will get the best and most accurate review possible.  In my opinion, This album has to rank in the top 10 as one of the GREATEST ALBUMS EVER RECORDED. Mojo Magazine recently held a poll as to what album is the GREATEST INSTRUMENTAL ALBUM OF ALL TIME. Guess what, Jimi Hendrix's "ARE YOU EXPERIENCED?" from 1967 won the poll as the GREATEST INSTRUMENTAL ALBUM OF ALL-TIME! This album TRULY DESERVES IT!   All the songs listed in this album are G-R-E-A-T! I also noticed that on all three versions I own of this album contain different song tracks or omitted main songs such as "Purple Haze," "The Wind Cries Mary" and "Foxey Lady." These ROCKERS and BALLAD along with "Manic Depression," "Fire," "Can You See Me," "I Don't Live Today" and the Main CENTERPIECE of the album entitled "Are You Experienced?" are all GREAT  songs that compliment this album. In my opinion, my favorite songs on this album are "May This Be Love" and "Remember." These two songs are so beautifully crafted and so well written by Hendrix that his emotions flow through his guitar and music resulting in some of the GREATEST MASTERPIECES on this album and in Rock n' Roll history. "May This Be Love" sounds so beautiful, romantic and poetic that you can not help but be absorbed and feel hypnotized by this slow mellow song but POWERFUL! I can talk about all of these songs but it will extend this review into a long review like my previous Hendrix reviews in the past. I highly reccommend this album and is a must and necessity for EVERYONE to own in their music collection.   In closing, Jimi Hendrix is the FIRST TRUE GUITAR GOD that has left his mark in Rock n' Roll history and will NEVER be forgotten. His accomplishments in Rock n' Roll as well as the Blues are revolutionary and legendary, there is only ONE Jimi Hendrix that comes along in a lifetime. There will NEVER be another Jimi Hendrix. What a tragic loss for Rock n' Roll. I hope you enjoyed reading my review as much as I enjoyed writing it for all of you. I also hope that you will read all of my other reviews in the near future when time permits. JIMI LIVES! LONG LIVE ROCK N' ROLL! Rock out always and take care. J.L.         +music
HE WAS A ONE MAN BAND!!!!!+N+The Songs on this cd show the scope of Wilbert Harrison's career. The  &quot;Kansas City&quot; cut is the one that almost everyone is familiar  with and is the original FURY recording. The rest of the cuts on this cd  were taken from various other companies that Wilbert recorded for from 1960  thru 1972. The cuts that are not included are his FURY/FIRE and SSS  International Cuts.  If you're looking for the best WILBERT HARRISON  package, this is not the one+music
the power and glory of the Huskers+P+If Iggy Pop helped, as he has claimed, "to wipe out the 60s," Bob Mould, Grant Hart and Greg Norton then helped to bring it back. That is, this band managed to expand upon the musical/emotional/cathartic possibilities in high speed hardcore by drawing upon 60s (and 70s) psychedelic and hard rock influences. For instance, elsewhere, the band cover such iconic 60s performers as Donovan (Sunshine Superman) and the Byrds (Eight Miles High). And like the Who's Quadrophenia LP, this too appears to be also a concept album about a young man's alienation from the world around him.  Here, such influences abound. For example, Dreams Reoccurring's psychedelic guitar freak out is followed by the absolute hardcore pounding of the great Indecision Time. Hare Krishna - based on the street chant by the well known western Hindu cult - then combines the hardcore, the psychedelic, and the religious even; just listen to Mould's crazy and unbelievable guitar playing on it. And then, a few cuts later, the song Pride. You can practically envision the band levitating off the floor of the recording studio, and it demands that you turn the volume way up, and maybe blow out a window or two to your house, till your neighbors come over, screaming at you to TURN DOWN THE NOISE. And this you cannot do, as you are caught up in a Husker Du trance. Such is the power of this 1984 masterpiece.  This then was the record that made me a huge fan of this group, and I will always be convinced that this remains one of rock's classic recordings by one of its all time greatest bands. I have mixed feelings about the idea of a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, but given that it exists to enshrine the greats of rock history, I predict that one day Husker Du will be enshrined there, and deservedly so.  Current day punk bands, I challenge you all to do anything half as raw and intense as this, I absolutely challenge you!   +music
A little more about the sound+P+Not being an "audiophilic" sophisticate I can hardly delve into details of this recording's sound reproduction, but it is not nearly as bad as to make this great performance un-listenable. Quite the opposite, the peculiarities of the sound have deeper reasons behind them. Bach wrote WTK for the keyboard, but in his mind he must have heard them played on a particular instrument. If Gould (whose WTK, IMHO, is his weakest Bach recording) plays it like a harpsichord, or Schiff (another dud) - like fortepiano, every note of Richter's performance echoes with the sound of an organ. I am certain it was deliberate on Richter's part, and the fact that the selected venue of the recording was a church, only confirms that notion. Of course, the church's acoustics did affect the sound, but in a way that was consistent with the artist's conception. As far as the playing itself, there is not much I can add to what has been written by the previous reviewers. Book II, which is somewhat more "abstract" portion of the WTK-48, receives great treatment here, but it is Richter's performance of Book I that stands like a solitary granite peak, high above the clouds, projecting mysterious and purifying force.+music
Too Little, Too Late+N+Although Bad Religion formed in 1980, they seem to fit in with the punk revival scene of the 1990's rather than the original hardcore punk scene.   Their first album, "How Could Hell Be Any Worse" which was released in 1982, was dwarfed by the competition in Southern California by such bands as Black Flag, the Circle Jerks, Social Distortion, and the Descendents. In 1983, they released "Into the Unknown," which was an attempt at cheesy progressive rock that was heavy on the synthesizers.  That album pretty much ended their relationship with the hardcore community and was such an embarrassment that they won't re-release it. Bad Religion was ignored until 1988 when they released "Suffer" to a new generation of hardcore fans.  At that point in time, hardcore punk was pretty much dead and Bad Religion was one of the only bands around at the time playing that style of music, so they were successful without any competition. "Against the Grain" is considered to be the peak of Bad Religion's career.  Once again, they were still one of the only bands around playing punk so there wasn't much to compare it to and that was a good thing for them because it's a weak record. The style of punk they play is very pop.  The only thing that gives it a punk edge is the speed, but it's not raw and angry like earlier hardcore.  Some say the lyrics are very angry, but it's tough to find the anger through the "whoa-whoa-whoas" and "aye-aye-ayes'." There's nothing wrong with using a harmonized and melodic pop rock vocal style, if you don't intend to be taken seriously.  The Misfits and the Descendents could pull off the pop vocal style because they generally sung about humorous and outlandish things.   Bad Religion sings about serious issues, but delivers it in an upbeat way which really kills any impact their message may have. The music that backs the computer geek sound of the vocals is all about speed and almost seems bouncy at times.  "21st Century Digital Boy" is the best song by far, but it's ruined by the vocals.  All the rest of the songs basically sound the same.  There are plenty of '80's hardcore records out there that are far superior to anything Bad Religion has ever recorded.  The '90's revival of punk had nothing new to offer the genre, so go straight to the source and listen to Black Flag, the Misfits, and the Dead Kennedys, who were original and sincere.          +music
My Sacrifice -- Listening to this album+N+Ahhh, the long awaited Scott Stapp solo album. The resurgence of Scott Stapp begs the immediate question -- Is there anything Scott Stapp can't do? The answer is invariably YES: sing, write decent songs, or stay out of jail. Lets start with the album cover and the goofy aramaic looking symbol behind him. When loosely translated, the writing reads the phrase "I'm a tool." Though I'll have to give him credit, I was expecting the album cover to be a picture of him nailed to a cross. Instead he went with a tastful picture of himself dressed like a biker and posing like he's being voilated by a [...] thermometer. For all those folks out there looking for that "inspiration" they all seem to find in Stapp's lyrics, I suggest you get some inspiration from the business end of a Lousiville slugger. Maybe then you won't reach out to the psuedo-Christian rocker that got arrested on his wedding day. And I don't even have to mention the video of him and Kid Rock having sex with groupies.+music
ouch+N+my least favorite simon album.  the writing is forced and inconsistent.  not very good+music
My Favorite+P+The CD I bought is wonderful, new just like described. The David Bowie/Bing Crosby Christmas Song and video, "Peace on Earth" is one of my all time favorites and I am glad I now have it. Thanks much... +music
This chick ROCKS...+P+Saw her on TV Reality show RockStar INEXS...thought she won ...came in 2nd had 2 have more....Think there will B more???? She doesn't need losers like these...anywa+music
Where'd the rock go?+N+Dissapointing after "image of the invisable". The rest of the disc is slow. I understand an artists right to make the album the way they truly wanted to with time taken to get it just the way they invision it, which is explained in detail with a booklet with the cd, but I'd rather they have had the deadline pressure and made another Artist in the Ambulance or Illusion of Safety.  Did they have to include a piano intro in almost every song on the album?  Maybe the songs will grow on me, but they will never feel like the good old stuff+music
Humble Name, Real Roots Rock Legends+P+The follow-up to the original "best of" NGDB collection, More Great Dirt, consists of more of the 80's country hits during their long career. The NGDB was once a folk and country-rock band, but the majority of the songs on More Great Dirt come from their mainstream country days, which were the most overlooked of their albums. They really had no one big radio hit during this time (except for "Fishin' In the Dark), which hurts this record, as does the fact that it is very overshadowed by the "Will The Circle Be Unbroken" albums that were huge hits. The highlights of the album include the summertime hit "Fishin' in the Dark," Bruce Springsteen's "Cadillac Ranch," and the rocking "Down That Road Tonight." It is too bad that there are only ten tracks here. In my opinion, this isn't up to par with the classic NGDB, but it is still good, quality country and folk. A good purchase if you want an overview of their latter days+music
Not very impressive+N+When I heard that Laura Powers was simular to Loreena Mckennit I rushed to get this cd.  I was very disappointed. Laura Powers Has a lovely voice and the songs are good, but she can't compare with Loreena Mckennit and Enya.  She lacks Enya and Loreena's surrealistic sound and Loreena's incredable instrumentation. When you Listen to Enya you feel like you have passed part way into the otherworld. When you listen to Loreena you feel like you have stepped back into the ancient world of mystics, Shamens and exotic lands.  Laura, although her music is soothing, provides no enchantment. Overall I would not recommend this Cd to anyone+music
Music To Chill Out+P+David Gates wrote some of the most soothing and melodic love songs of the seventies and that voice of his must have melted a lot of female hearts! Although all the best songs of Bread are here, this album would have been more complete if it had included the David Gates classic "Goodbye Girl".  +music
Great music ... but buggy Macromedia "special features"+N+The music makes the CD worth getting; however, the so-called special features (i.e., worthless advertising) can ruin your ability to enjoy the music on a computer system.  For example, on my computer's CD/DVD player, the buggy software part of the disc makes the music unplayable.  On a different drive (a CD/RW), the music portion of the disc can be played; however, at times their annoying Macromedia advertising interface will pop up, sometimes multiple simultaneous copies, stopping the music.  And if you kill the advertising "stubs," you can be left with the side effect of an annoying beep whenever you move the mouse pointer over a web link.  Please put more tracks of music on CDs -- complete score and songs -- but leave off the bogus "special" features!  (And for that matter, I don't appreciate the cutesy attempt on other CDs to "hide" extra music tracks by putting minutes of silence before final tracks.  This is especially bad on multi-disc players where you don't want long periods of silence -- at least not until all discs have been played.+music
Not what I was looking for...+N+I was pretty disappointed by this.  I was looking for songs that my kids could sing and dance to.  This just was not it!!  It's too bad, its one of my daughter's favorite movies.+music
Great Product+P+My mother enjoyed this product. I bought it for her as a gift+music
Awesome Strings+P+These are two incredibly talented guys with a passion for playing the violin.  The music is very upbeat with a jazzy flair.+music
Better than first album+N+There's a reason you don't know much about his earlier career.  If you want to listen to a sucky indulgent late 60's California band, get QuickSilver Messenger Service first album.  At least Sailor had a minor hit (Living in the USA).  I would be more lenient if this was the first album.  Seeds of potential can be heard on some of the tracks, but he's got a long way to go. He must have been connected, I would not have let him record another album after the first.  But, good thing they did because he was much better in the 70's. +music
Daughter Loves It+P+My daughter received this CD for Christmas. She loves it and plays it at least once a day+music
The best of Art Pepper+P+For new jazz fans or long time Art Pepper fans this is a must-have album.  With the backing of Davis' rhythm section Pepper finds his tightest recording. It would have been ideal if they could have mixed in some original material, but this collection of covers really shows Pepper's strength+music
"Another AC/DC triumph"+P+Let There Be Rock is an amazing album filled with smash hits such as "Whole Lotta Rosie" and "Let There Be Rock". And other great songs like "Dog Eat Dog". This is a must-have album for anyone that likes classic AC/DC.  1. Go Down- This song is okay, a pretty good rocker. 7/10 2. Dog Eat Dog- One of my all-time favorite AC/DC songs. It has a catchy beat and a good chorus. 9/10 3. Let There Be Rock- A classic rocker, this song tells the story of how rock came to be. 8/10 4. Bad Boy Boogie- A mediocre song, gets kind of repetitive, but has a good bluesy feel. 7/10 5. Problem Child- A very catchy song, but why did they put it on here again? It was originally on Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap. 8/10 6. Overdose- This song's kind of filler, but has good guitar. 7/10 7. Hell Ain't A Bad Place To Be- Good song, just a plain rocker. 8/10 8. Whole Lotta Rosie- Funny song, and has good guitar. A little disturbing though. 8/10  This AC/DC album is almost like a AC/DC: Greatest Hits, because it has a lot of good songs on it. Definitely something to have in your collection+music
Best CD I purchased since going deaf+N+This is the best CD in my exhausted collection since gong deaf three years ago.  My other favorites are &quot;Walking In The Wind&quot; by Marcel Marso, &quot;Dancing In The Dark&quot; by Helen Keller, and the sound track of &quot;Finding Our Way On Stage&quot;, the concert featuring Ray Charles, Stevie Wonder, Ronnie Milsap, George Sheering, Diane Shure, Jose Feliciano and Dan Quayle+music
Not good....not good at all...+N+Sorry.  I'm as big of a Bowie fan as anyone, but I have to be objective and honest: Bowie's output from 'Let's Dance' through this album, 'Earthling', just flat out sucked.  Sure, there were good tracks here and there, but Bowie's heart just seemed to not be in his music.  In the '70's, he changed from style-to-style and developed his reputation as a musical chameleon...but COMMITMENT was in each of those recordings.  Beginning with 'Let's Dance', it almost seemed as if he felt a need to constantly change to live up to his reputation and keep current and modern, but his head was somewhere else.  Take this album.  It's supposed to be club music and electronically-disco based, but that style combined with Bowie's Anthony Newley-styled vocals just clash and the overall effect is more irritating than enchanting.  The opening track, "Little Wonder", is such an alarming turn-off that it's hard not to turn the damn thing off without listening to the rest of the CD.  Thankfully, beginning with his next album, 1999's 'Hours', Bowie seemed content to accept his past, his legend and his legacy without having to jump aboard every musical trend that pops up.  The result has been three excellent albums in a row ('Hours', 'Heathen', and 'Reality')+music
A FINE ASSORTMENT+P+TO THE NU-SOUL, LOVER , THIS IS THE COMPILATION TO HAVE, GOOD ASSORTMENT OF TRACKS THAT COVERS THE GENRE. CHOKLATE IS ONE MY FAVORITE ARTIST ON THIS LABEL BE SURE TO CHECK HER OUT+music
Excellent mix of everything - all your needs get met...+P+This CD is excellent.  It's a soulful mix of jazz, hip hop, and R&B. Kajmere is a distribution company on the west coast turning out indiesoul, hip hop, dance, and indierock.  They typically turn out 12" releases - most of these cuts are from these releases.  And, this is exactly how this music sounds to me - underground, like hidden treasure - each track.  From Adriana Evans' "Remember the Love", to N8E's "Tread Lightly" and "Rock On", to all of DJ Tonks' tracks, to Presto and LOWD's "Back in 92", to "Love" by the Globetroddas, this CD is an outstanding soulful representation of where I hope music continues to go.  Buy it - you won't be disappointed. +music
Shadow Wolf+N+The most irrattating piece of music I've purchased in a long time. I was glad to sell it . The phrasing made previous favorites annoying. I don't think I'll be buying any more of her music unless it's for resale on the web+music
Dan's Still The Man!!!!!!+P+I remember seeing Dan Fogelberg in concert when I was about 15 or 16 years old. Awesome! After seeing him in concert, I became a fan! The power of his music and song have deeply touched me!  Everytime I hear &quot;Leader of the Band&quot;, I am moved.  It's such a heartfelt tribute to his father.  Every picture tells a story--and Dan tells a fine story behind each song. To sum this album in five words or less: Beautiful and Relaxing+music
Saxophone, Bass and Drums make a great Trio. +P+Sonny Rollins, Ray Brown and Shelly Mann are all superb on this 71 minute album. It comprises 6 tunes; three of which have alternate takes added as bonus tracks. The originals and alternates are similarly compelling. Although my personnal favourite is Wagon Wheels, all 9 tracks are excellent.  The uncanny sense of space and the Western mood created by the trio make the cd great listening.   I am a big fan of Sonny Rollins and his happy, muscular, witty, rich and edgy sound. This album sees all three musicians in marvellous form, with the rhythm section brilliantly creating the illusion of movement.     I would recommend this as THE album to buy to begin a Sonny Rollins collection.   No words can adequately describe the treat that awaits you; however some may point in the right direction. They are; lyrical, witty, warm and imaginative. Way Out West is most original and is one of my favourite cds. +music
Not good, but not entirely bad.+N+I bought this cd online but realized soon afterwards that it was hard to listen to...but Heavenbound was so impressive I cannot give it a bad rating. First of all, of course it's bad! It was their first cd, it was the late '80s and Kevin was not a prominent member. But rewind, give them grace and see how far they've come, and you'll appreciate how they started out, however bad it was. However, I see no reason for anyone but a die-hard fan to buy this cd. Compared to the other incredible selection of Christian music that is out now, it's a pitiful little dot in the corner. But it signifies the start of successful Christian rap/hip hop, so it's pretty interesting as far as Christian music history goes. But like I said, it's not worth it if you don't know the group. Don't "start here", and in fact, don't even really end here. It's more interesting than "good".  Overall, it's not the greatest...but if you think it's worth the buy for Heavenbound, then do it, because the song is really lyrically great+music
If you're a fan of the band, skip it+N+I bought this CD for a few bucks a while ago at a Christian music store. The next day I brought it back. I expected it to be different, but I didn't expect it to be horrible.  This is early '90s rap. We're talking really bad here. Like, Vanilla Ice/Ninja Rap-bad. They had to start somewhere, but if you want my advice, skip this and go to the good stuff - Supernatural, Jesus Freak, etc+music
...and so it begins+N+remember when green day was hot back in 1994, and in the years to come, a million and one soundalikes would come along? well, it's happening again, this time with the band fall out boy.   fall out boy got huge around 2003 when their hit single "grand theft autumn" exploded onto the music scene and put "take this to your grave" on everyone's "amazon favorite list". in 2004, the band signed with major-label "island", and has proved to be one of the labels most successful acts. weeks on end with number 1 singles, thousands of records sold (millions of downloads) and a massive following could only bring one thing; the clones.   june is "victory records" first attempt to cash in on fall out boy mania, with a manic post-punk sound and stump-esque vocals. although they aren't exactly a carbon-copy, the influence is too blatant, and that alone makes it highly passable. nothing new here folks, just fall out boy on a smaller scale.   on a quick side-note, victory has just released another record from a band called "the audition". this band sounds even MORE like fall out boy, and their instant popularity means that june will probably have to take the backseat for a little while.   get something more original instead...+music
disappointing+N+i should have previewed the selections on this collection more closely.  the quality of the recordings is fair to poor and the actual selections are uninspiring, considering the wealth of classics generated during this period of history.  in sum, there are much better anthologies out there than this one+music
Great+P+Great album, but what is the song at the end credits? I love that song+music
What a fabulous album+P+I'm not going to say too much other than ...WOW ... what a fabulous album - this is one that you can jut belt out anywhere - I love it+music
Best CD Ever Borrowed +P+I Had heard of Unearth before as one of the best Hardcore/Metal bands around.  When I had the Opprotunity to borrow their album Stings of Conscience from a good friend, I immediately took the initiative.  I Had been hearing this album while in my homies' ride, and I was hooked after the second song(One Step Away) when I heard that insane guitar. Then the crazy drums, and the screaming, and everything else it was pure mayhem.  This has to be my new favorite Band.  I Can't wait to see them live.  This is the best free CD I had ever recieved.  I recommend that you go out and buy this album to support this great band.  I plan to buy more albums from them too. \\m/+music
DAZ'S BEST ALBUM EVA!!+P+To everyone that wasn't feelin Daz on "Tha Dogg Pound Gangsta LP" (including me)--this album has a completely different sound. The title is kinda lame, but it duz spell out what this album is all about. When Daz left Cali for the South, it seemed as if he finally sold out... this could not be further from the truth. "Gangsta Crunk" is 100 timez more gangsta and on-point than anything that has come out of the West for the last few years. Daz crushes The Game and Snoop with this release, even outdoing his classic debut, "Retaliation, Revenge, and Get Back." Don't let the title fool you--"Gangsta Crunk" doesn't feature any dumbazz Lil-Jon type hooks, only bombazz beats & hardcore lyrics. The best cutz are "I'm Looking for Dat Gangsta Bit*h," "A License to Kill," "We Mean Bizniz," and "Tow Up from Tha Flo' Up"--the latter two both being classics. Props to Daz for turning his career around; can't wait for the Dogg Pound Reunion album+music
Incredible EP+P+Let me just say that Joe Satriani is in opinion the best guitar player/musician in the world, and to be able to see him live is an unforgettable experience.  Dreaming #11, and Disc 2 of Time Machine are as close as you can get to experiencing Satch live.  The highlight on this disc has to be the live recording of Memories, it's almost double the length of the studio version and a hundred times better (although the studio version is still a very moving piece of music).  If you are any kind of Satriani fan, or guitar enthusist pick up this album, you won't regret it+music
Long time listener to Van Morrison+P+This CD is a great collection of early to recent more early Van Morrison. I bought the album primairly for the Song "Cleaning Windows", but foung many more favorits on this album after purchasing it+music
Catchy, heavy songs with a wide range of vocals+P+At one time, I was pretty much a sucker for all nu metal that was kinda underground and wasn't out for the money. Now, I find myself listening to few bands, such as Fear Factory, Type O Negative, and Machine Head. I've pretty much abandoned all the other guys. So why does switched fit in? Because they pull off emotion in great variety and it's not simply sounds battering your ears. Along with these guys I definitely recommend From Zero, who can be compared to these guys except more on the melodic side+music
The debut of arguably the greatest American rock band ever+P+It was in June of 1972 that classic rock legends The Eagles released their self-titled debut album, which was a great blend of pop, rock and country.  Drummer Don Henley, bass player Randy Meisner, guitarist Bernie Leadon and guitarist/keyboardist Glenn Frey would finally have the chance to prove to the world that they were musical geniuses whom not only could play well but sing so well with harmonies that were flawless after first playing together in legendary country/rock/pop singer Linda Ronstadt's backing band and after they finished the tour with Linda she blessed the guys to break out on their own and the band didn't forget her and she subsequently signed to Asylum thanks to The Eagles' success.  The band has since this debut became the best-selling American band of all time, and is also one of the Top 4 ahead of Pink Floyd and behind only Led Zeppelin and The Beatles.  This debut album was produced and engineered by Glyn Johns, the same man responsible for engineering albums by The Who, Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, The Faces and The Beatles among others.  The heavily country-influenced Take It Easy opens this stellar album and was a great intro to The Eagles. The rock classic Witchy Woman follows and was the world's intro to Henley's voice which would become more dominant in later albums(he would also sing the rocking Nightingale). The rocking Chug All Night follows and has superb vocals from Glenn. Randy steps out in front for the ballad Most of Us Are Sad which is a great song. The aforementioned Nightingale follows and is a great rocker.  The second half kicks off with guitarist Bernie's country tinged Train Leaves Here This Morning and is a great song. The countryish-rocker Take The Devil is chilling with a great Meisner vocal. The country-ish Earlybird follows and has Bernie on vocals and just is a great number. The slower but still excellent tune Peaceful Easy Feeling follows and was the album's other hit single. The album closes with the rocker Tryin which was one of Randy's best vocal performances.  This album has held up well and this was the last Eagles album I bought in 1991 when I was 15 on cassette and regretted not acquiring it earlier as I thought the album would stink aside from the three singles which are on the various best ofs(Take it Easy, Witchy Woman and Peaceful Easy Feeling).  This album is a classic and is highly recommended! +music
very very poor+N+I waited for over a month and a half. To be so dissapointed in this Cd.  I love jazz tributes and even Gerald himself would be lost on this one. No smooth grooves and surely could use a touch of jazz vocalists also.  The tribute to Luther is something that the producers of this Cd needs to listen to and get a few lessons from it. not even deserving of a sta+music
It's delirious.+P+This is a very strange album.  It features a lot of imaginative sonic "experiments".  Such as instruments recorded at half speed or double speed, and then played back at normal speed.  Also vocals or instruments recorded backwards and then played forwards.  It's all way ahead of it's time, and it should be of interest to anyone who likes unusual music+music
FAKEY-*Fake Live Album Alert*+N+Not only is this a bad representation of AC/DC Live, (They only opened up with Riff Raff during the brief POWERAGE tour and who cares about Rock N Roll Damnation, live anyway), but this is a fake live album. Judging by many of the alternate live recordings available, AC/DC just never sounded like this live, its all doctored up, the crowd noise is fake (listen to the "Fweep" of the tape machine being turned off at the end of "Whole Lotta Rosie", a glaring mistake and proof of the fakiness. Not a horrible album, Hell aint a bad place and problem child are pretty good, but where is Live Wire? Rocker was'nt available yet in the USA either which just makes it all the more confusing. Proof that Bon Scott Ac/Dc album can .... PS: Let there be Rock and FLick of the switch are the best Ac/DC albums..+music
Infuriating!+N+The biggest idiots I've ever heard except for Rappers of course.  This is a band that could have been a great band if it wasn't for the goofy vocalist botching and making a joke out of everything.  The musicianship is definately there, excellent musicianship, but comic book lyrics and vocals trash it all!  After a few songs of this, the humor gets old real quick.  It's sad to see such gifted Southern musicians live up to an outdated stereotype played out by a childish vocalist who thinks all of life is a joke.  If it wasn't for this, and they had gotten a real vocalist to sing the songs seriously, they probably would have been as big as Lynyrd Skynryd, and their musicianship gives strong evidence of what should have been, instead of them being reduced to dime store novelty status!  Thank god that Lynyrd Skynyrd, Ozark Mountain Daredevils, and Molly Hatchett got it right, and did the South proud with some dignity+music
One of my favorite recordings!+P+I am not a fan of the &quot;sound of a countertenor or male alto.&quot;  I stumbled upon this recording &amp; cannot stop listening to it and recommending it to friends. Scholl's voice is not &quot;plummy&quot; but  strong and vibrant and filled with colors. I would love to see and hear him  in person-perhaps an opera if this is where he wants his career to go.  I  am a fan &amp; have just purchased 3 more of his cd's+music
Dual Disc CD won't play in many CD players+N+How idiotic.  So far this CD ONLY plays on my computer.  I have 4 other CD players, one of which I bought ONE MONTH ago and the CD will not play.  On the back of the CD there is small print saying that "the audio side does not conform to CD specifications and therefore will not play on some CD and DVD players".   Maybe Amazon needs to make that very obvious in the writeup on the CD.    I pay my money for the music legally and I can't listen to it.  I am not likely to pay return shipping on it to Amazon b/c it isn't worth the effort or money.  I feel pretty ripped off.  Now I'll have to COPY it onto a CD to listen to it. +music
tbs's best, easily+P+there will always be a special place for this album in the hearts of tbs fans. it is easily their best-ive been listening to it for years. i dont know whats happening to the band now (with their crappy "louder now" album), but i will always love this cd. get it if you havent already, i promise youll like it+music
Fun album of mostly new material+P+This is probably the best of the Spongebob CD's released to date.  It has a cute radio-station theme that is woven in between the songs.  Though the first few songs are just repeats of previous albums, there are a number of great new songs.  So the CD is worth the money.  Parents be aware that there are two songs that deal with "mature" subjects in a childish way (dealing with underwear and saying bad words).  Overall a fun album+music
Not Horrible, But Not Great Either+N+I won't say this was a horrible CD because it wasn't, it's just when you've heard enough good Bass 'n Nova/Jazzanova albums, you will realize that this album cannot compare to the others that are out there on the market. Most of the songs on this album don't grab your attention the way they do on really great albums (and you all know what I mean - you know that feeling when you pop in a CD for the first time and just get hooked by the addictiveness of a great album? - well folks that's what I'm talking about). Unfortunately this album failed to deliver that effect. It's too bad because the artwork on the cover is really nice, not to mention the fact that Putumayo usually puts together an enjoyable, reliable series of world music. The inside of this CD also has a booklet which tells you a little bit about the artists and the songs, which is always nice to know. Having been an avid listener of Brazilian music my entire life, I am enjoying the transition of old meets new in Brazilian electronic music. It doesn't have the annoying, frantic beats that American techno/trance music has. Rather it is a simple, but truly enjoyable blend of samba and bossa nova mixed with modern and futuristic electronica dance beats and sounds. However if you really want to find out more about this new wave in Brazilian music, I would recommend checking out another album. Although this album has a decent lineup of new Brazilian electronic Bass 'n Nova/Jazzanova artists, it doesn't take advantage of showcasing any of their good songs+music
Only imitation of great art+N+I used to own this cd and I thought it was absolutely groundbreaking and a wonderfully creative release from Mike Patton and Co.  However, I just bought Torture Garden by Naked City.  The fact is, Naked City was doing this exact same stuff over 10 years ago!  I could not believe that art like this came out back then!  Don't get this cd, it is Patton ripping off John Zorn's brilliance.  Get Torture Garden instead.  It is much more daring for its age and actually just sounds much better, fuller.  Mike Patton is mosly ridding the inspirations of other artists+music
His overall best!+P+While I was kind of slow to get this because of his use of beats that I heard before on "Smooth operator" and his second R&B release "I get the Job Done," other singles like "Calling Mr. Welfare" and "Another Victory"(some of THE illest flows ever in a rap record!!!), I had no choice but to get it.  While he was in the process or abandoning Marley Marl (for a lack of gong platinum like he felt that he should have.  He wanted to be the next LL and could have been...), this album turns out to be better (overall) than his first one because he has more songs on it.  The songs are good and the beats are hot although some songs use beats that we have heard beofore.    In order to understand (young people and those new to hip-hop) why the Big Daddy Kane and Rakim are mentioned as THE best while they are not seen or heard from, you have to get their first two albums.  If you don't understand then, you never will.  If you think that Tupac was a great MC or that Tupac and/or Biggie were the greatest of all time, then you would hate on this album because you listened during a time of simplistic lyrics and a persona(and looks.Tupac) that sold in instead of real skills.  If you hear this and you cannot say that BDK and Rakim are THE best rappers ever, then you judge rappers by how much violence they bring and how much crap they talk.  NONE of these rapper can even compare to one paragragh by BDK on this album.  He alomst took LL's spot after that Kool Moe Dee battle almost did LL in (they 'forgot' to mention that on "Behind the Music..."), but after LL came out with "To the Break of Dawn" and "jingling Baby," LL was back on top.  BDK.  A man who ruined his own career.  I still can't get over it..+music
Good performance, antiquated recording+N+My kids and I have much enjoyed this recording, but the narration is often too quiet and sounds a bit muffled.  Moreover, the narrator speaks with a British accent, making comprehension a bit trickier for little ones.  In general, I have missed the sound quality obtained in digital recordings, so I'm now shopping for a better recording of this wonderful piece of music+music
Musically weak - later work is far stronger+N+Having really enjoyed 'You've come a long way baby' - one of my favorite albums - I had high hopes for this work, after all, they are just a year or two apart. Oh, was I disappointed.  Perhaps if one were thrashing around at a rave party while out of their gourd on X, then this album would sound a little better, but stone cold sober I really had a hard time with this ensemble. The constant looped samples just repeat and repeat seemingly, in some instances, for ever. I see this album almost as a test case for Cook's later - and musically far better - work. One can really see the roots here of how this style and sound was massaged and refined into something much more musically coherent with 'You've come a long way baby'.  Song For Lindy stands out as one of the more tolerable tracks along with Going Out of My Head, Everybody Needs a 303 and Michael Jackson. The guitar riff in Santa Cruz never seems to stop and gives me a headache while the lyrics in Give a Po' Man a Break could do exactly that. The rest of the tracks are evidently an exercise in how to use a sequencer and are apparently written to cram as many repeated samples into each song as possible.  I really wanted to like this album, but it offers little of redeeming quality; quite simply it's dull. Ultimately, there is just not enough here to warrant its purchase+music
This sucks bigtime+N+What the hell is this crapola? The real Misfits were not about lame as* bullsh*t! Like everyone else says, what you usually hear without Danzig has lost it's edge. They lost their edge. What's the point of making music and calling yourself the Misfits when you're really not changing anything? Punk is about change. Change is usually edgy, this is honestly far from that. The Misfits changed music - they had their own sound, they were original, and nobody else had that sound. I'm saying this about alot of other bands. We're not Danzig heads, we're not kissing as*. The Misfits truly lost their edge. We're not expecting every band to always sound the same - but at least create newer and edgier music because nowadays every band sounds the same. It's all up to the original bands to influence everybody, and when you're making music that doesn't influence anyone, what's your point - money?+music
Noise!!!!!!!!+N+Although the last couple of years I mainly listen to jazz from The phenomenal period of music between the early 1950's and late 1960's, I am continually amazed at the abundance of quality  output. The Blue Note re-issues of works by Horace Silver, Lee Morgan, Grant Green, Larry Young, Hank Mobley, Art Blakey and Blue Mitchell to just name a few are true musical expressions of a fine art.   But Ascension by Coltrane is noise and certainly does not fit in with the works of the above artists which represented great musical milestones. Only his early stuff can really be classed as music.+music
The Hits And More+P+If you are looking for the hits of Billy Joel, this is the place.  All of his major hits are here and in one place.  There are no live cuts, no alternate takes, just song after song from one of the best musicians of the last 30 years.  If you have some of his other CDs, you may quibble about some of the choices on the set.  For example, I have a soft spot for "Leave A Tender Moment Alone" and that is not here.  But that is minor.  The 4th CD in this set is a gem, from his talks on the "business" of music, how records actually do get made.  You get a feel for Joel as a person as he talks about growing up as he explains how and why he wrote songs such as Scenes, Vienna and Piano Man+music
Doris Day - Greatest Hits -- You can't help but love this CD+P+I never even knew that I was a fan of Doris Day until I heard one of her songs in a recent popular movie.  I bought the 'Greatest Hits' album, thinking the song would be on there, and it wasn't.  It didn't matter - because I fell in love with the album anyway.  I was never a fan of 'Fifties' music, however, this album has a timeless quality that anyone could love.  It makes you feel like you should be in a dimly-lit night club with some brandy, a fine cigar, and a beautiful woman sitting atop a black baby grand.  Enjoy+music
ONJ at her best+P+Wow, what a trip back in time!  As I listen to this album, I am immediately transported back to my brother's car, listening to Olivia scream like a banshee on "Please don't keep me waiting".  Certainly, the cover art, along with the release of "Grease" earlier that same year (1978), made an impression on my 13-year old mind - but now that I'm a mellower, 41 year old, I still am astounded by the quality of this album.  Great music, track after track.  My personal favorites are "Please don't keep me waiting", "Borrowed Time", "Dancing round and round", and "Boats against the Current".  As for "Boats", Eric Carmen should be very pleased with the fine treatment that Olivia gave this beautiful song of his.  Sadly, as of my writing this in Nov, 2006, the CD is STILL ONLY AVAILABLE AS AN IMPORT - what a miscarriage of justice!  Anyway, it's worth the effort to secure a copy - thanks to Amazon for making it available+music
The Best+P+What a great return from a group that bent the 80's on their ears, video masters! Solo or together, they rock the world and always will!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Danny mmetuchek@hotmail.co+music
Wonderful Songs+P+I'm with Stephen. 30 years of listening, and this album gets better all the time. "Marie" is fabulous. Of course, Randy's work in general is fabulous.  Don't let the title put you off.  Tho+music
Finally!+P+I've waited for what seems to be an impossibly long time for Cory Morrow's new CD, and it's been well worth the wait. There's only one word I can come up with to describe this album -- AMAZING.  I couldn't be prouder to call myself a fan of Cory+music
Haunting, evocative, achingly beautiful+P+If you like Gorecki and Part, you will want to buy this cd.  As a classical music fan with widespread interests, I have placed this on my favorites shelf.  It is deeply spiritual, tuneful, and interesting. +music
Listen to the Dramatics at their best!+P+I recently purchased this CD, what can I tell you it was   like tasteing  vintage champagne. I wanted more,the only   negative was they left out my  favorite Dramatics song life   of the party. Otherwise a great cd Just  shopping not buying,   if your not a fan this song will seal the deal. The  intro alone   is worth the price of the cd and Ron Bank's  falsetto(unbelieve   able). My recommendation buy it now+music
How dissapointing+N+I find it hard to believe that the same band who put out the heavy metal classic "Burn My Eyes" and the strong follow-up "The More Things Change", would suddenly sink into the nu-metal trash. To be honest, most nu-metal that I actually like, I wouldn't buy a CD from(the nu-metal CDs I do have are from my nu-metal phase). The awesome riffs, the cool solos, the sweet drumming, and a band who had a message about society have been pushed aside here for power chords, rapping, and self loathing lyrics. I gave this 2 stars because I like 2 or 3 songs on here, but one of those 3 songs is a cover. When I saw the music video for "From this Day", it almost made me want to slap Rob in the face. He went from a tall, powerful metalhead to a stupid, trendy, spiky-haired w igger. They would get worse on "Supercharger", but thank god that Machine Head recovered on "Through the Ashes of the Empires". This is not a good place to start for Machine Head at all. Get their first 2 albums and their new one to hear Rob and the gang as a post thrash/groove metal powerhouse, not a nu-metal slump+music
stellar performance+P+Even if I were not the photographer who contributed the cover photos I would rate this album as a ten.  For this release, SONiA has cooked up a band of incredible talent and passion which drives her songs to a whole new level of glory.  An added bonus is sister CiNDY's vocals on the Kerrville tracks which connect this recording to the past of disappear fear.  This new incarnation of disappear fear rocks and its sound can only go up from here.  It is as spontaneous and as fixed in time as SONiA's smile on the cover.  Gotta love this one+music
Poor Effort+N+This is not a good product for someone as talented as Dr. Smith. Poor arrangements and uninspired playing.  Saving the CD somewhat are the tunes Trouble Man,  Willow Weep For Me and Freedom Jazz Dance+music
i do not like this album+N+i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this albu+music
Marc anthony is the man!+P+Marc anthony is the man.I love this cd infact,as I am writing this I am listening to "I need you" one of the songs from the cd.This cd gets a 10/1+music
Love that Anthony!+P+Marc Anthony sings with so much love and passion that it's hard to stop listening once you play this CD. I really like his music a lot. Every word is meaningful and intuned with such deep feelings. The way he sings about love makes me want to fall in love. This is another great album of his+music
Wonderful Album+P+One of my favorite albums ever.  I've had it for years and still love it.  Teenager of the Year is also good+music
The time of our lives+N+I love Il Divo but very disappointed with this CD. It's very short and a repeat of songs in previous releases+music
In its way recalls Mr John Coltrane's A Love Supreme+P+The impression I'm left with from this fine music is that Mr Lloyd has come to terms with ...life? ... Art?  ...God? With two thirds of the Brad Mehldau trio (youth) balanced by masters Mr Billy Higgins and Mr John Abercombie(experience) there is absolutely no sense of strain. The water might be wide but it is also deep. The spirituality and sense of communion and peace that suffuses this music is apparent in the verse, the programming and packaging of this CD. It opens with one of the most poignant of Mr Hoagy Carmichael's songs - GEORGIA - and who can fail to recall the emotional baggage that song carries, not the least of which is its interpretation by Mr Ray Charles. There is a homage to Ms Billie Holiday in a song by the leader called LADY DAY. There is Mr Strayhorn's LOTUS BLOSSOM and Mr Ellington's BLACK BUTTERFLY. It seems as though Mr Lloyd is paying homage to the roots of the music - spirituals, folk songs,the blues, pain, love and the black experience - through some of its major progenitors including the great bassist Mr Cecil McBee whose SONG OF HER is included. This is not to say the music is lacking in joy. FIGURE IN BLUE with its spritely rhythms is one case in point. LOTUS BLOSSOM too is liltingly, swingingly lovely. Mr Lloyd's tenor can sometimes sound as sweet as an alto but throughout there is a quiet, thoughtful, passionate and masterful musician at work here completely supported in his vision for this programme of music by his musicial compadres. In this music I am reminded of John Coltrane's A LOVE SUPREME, David Murray's SPIRITUALS and Mr Duke Ellington's inclination towards the sacred+music
bath time and candle light+P+Had a crappy day? need to relaxe? start the bath water and light the candles. Set this CD up and you'll have a better night ahead of you.  Start with track #1 move on to track #3,9,11,12 then on to 14.  You'll feel so much better!!! I have this whle collection and this is one of my favorite compilations. I hated Chillout 06 and was dissapointed in 05 but 02-04 are safe bets!! go with the flow and CHILLOUT+music
Amazing piece of music+P+This opera is absolutely amazing.  I used it to help process the grief that I experienced due to the death of my closest Aunt.  It worked+music
A classic rock album brought down by poor sound quality+P+THE BAND: Ian Gillan (vocals), Ritchie Blackmore (guitar), Jon Lord (keyboards), Roger Glover (bass), Ian Paice (drums & percussion).   THE DISC: (1970) Originally 8 tracks long clocking in at approximately 47 minutes. This digitally remastered (UK) version released in 1995 adds 12 bonus tracks bringing the total listen to just over 78 minutes. This is the band's 4th album. Included with the disc is a 22-page booklet containing song titles/time/credits, numerous photos (some unreleased); a brief insight to the making of and happenings during the time the album was made - by Roger Glover and (writer) Simon Robinson (with quotes from Gillan and Lord as well); and the discography of "In Rock" in various countries. Label - EMI Records.  COMMENTS: After purchasing the "Machine Head" and "Fireball" deluxe anniversary packages... I couldn't wait to get my mitts on "Deep Purple In Rock". Every song is a fast paced rocker here with the exception of the ten minute "Child In Time" - one of my favorite slow rockers... and one of Gillan's many highlights vocally, as well as Lord's wonderful slow intro and Blackmore's guitar solo once the song picks up. For some reason, I was thinking Roger Glover cold fix the original tapes and make these songs sound like they were recorded last year. Not so. The sound is still as muddy as ever. In many places, Ian Paice's cymbals & hi-hat are non-existent. Lord's organ/keyboards are mixed so poorly at times it's tough to distinguish between his high notes and Blackmore's high notes. Disappointing to say the least - it still sounds like a.m. radio. I grew up with Deep Purple and I have 17 of the discs. "In Rock" was easily not my favorite, but it was definitely top 5 due to great songs like "Black Night", "Speed King", "Flight Of The Rat" and "Child In Time" (check out the live version of this song on "Made In Japan"... I'll go out on a limb and claim it's better than the studio version here). "Black Night" and "Speed King" made it to most of their greatest hits compilations, while "Child In Time" made it to a few. The bonus tracks are a plus. Though the sleeve will have you salivating at "12" bonus tracks, it's really only "6". The other "6" are intro's to each song lasting on average 20-30 seconds each. Various chit-chat and Blackmore fooling around on his guitar. These 6 bonus songs sound great... slightly different, and much improved sound over the original 8 tracks. 2 of the tracks are unreleased - "Jam Stew" and "Cry Free"... both treats! Two bonus versions of "Speed King", and an unedited remix of "Black Night" are the highlights. In my opinion, the back photo is very telling... Glover is front and center and the backbone of the band - perhaps the glue keeping the 5 members together (knowing how Blackmore and Gillan got along). For me, this is a very good album, but the poor sound quality keeps me from rating it any higher. The lone track "Child In Time" and the bonus songs make this a must-have disc+music
A satisfying musical journey+P+Over the years I've gotten weary of people ragging on Mingus because it doesn't meet their expectations - it doesn't sound like Joni Mitchell should, it doesn't sound like Mingus would have wanted it to, it doesn't sound like jazz should, etc., etc. Listeners should get over all that and appreciate it for what it is - a challening, beautiful, eclectic, and even mystical musical journey. It's holding up beautifully all these years later.+music
Leave the light on+P+I couldn't think of a better title for my review, listen to the the song and I think you will agree. Chris Smither gets better with every cd that he makes. He has a sound of his own and sees and hears life through a very unique perspective. There is not a cut on this cd that I don't like. Try it you want be disapointed+music
Cute -- but the packaging is better than the music+N+A lot of the performances are horrid, some of the arrangements are insipid. There ended up being about 30 tunes and songs here that were of interest--and over 100 that I'll never listen to again. In many ways, it's a beautifully packaged vanity project of limited interest musically.+music
Music to listen to while watching whales die+N+In the 1970s and 1980s I bought most of the ECM catalog as albums were released.  This was the first one I actually hated.  I also hated Jan Garbarek's &quot;Afric Pepperbird&quot; but was already a Garbarek fan from &quot;Dansere&quot; and &quot;Witchi-Tai-To&quot; and if I had listened to &quot;Afric Pepperbird&quot; first, I might never have bought other Garbarek albums, as I have never purchased another Stanko recording.  It is common to comment on a trumpet player's technique, but Stanko has none upon which to comment.  For reference, my preferred trumpeters are Kenny Wheeler and Roy Hargrove+music
A very disappointing follow-up to his first CD.+N+I have Schimmel's first CD, &quot;Comes Clean,&quot; which is absolutely hilarious.  So, I ordered this CD and waited for it to arrive with much anticipation.  As soon as I received it, I couldn't wait to listen to it  with my husband, also a fan of the first CD.  Unfortunately, we barely  snickered throughout the entire CD.  Maybe because his style was no longer  new to us+music
When my mind is numb playing tricks on me and the world is crashing...+P+I'll start off with the thing that will get me unhelpful votes, but it needs to be said. I've heard very few songs by KMFDM so my introduction to Lucia came in the form of Revolver Magazine. Without ever truly hearing her voice I decided to get From The Land Of Volcanos.  That was nearly a month ago and this CD is still in heavy rotation. This has been one of those CDs to escape with. For the 54 and some odd second running time, you're in a completely different place. Lucia's voice and the lush melodies sweep over you and you lose all sense of time. Few CDs do that so to find one that does it, and so successfully at that, is quite the relief. Whether the song is of the harder variety or just as relaxing as can be, at no point does this record stall, it moves swiftly, which is, ironically, my only gripe with it as well.  From the very beginning of So Clever I figured I was in for quite a ride. So Clever is just a solid song, nothing more. Breathy vocals through the verses turn into an ear catching chorus. I Don't Care has some of the best lyrics on the disc, plus the chorus pretty much soars. Fear is a lyrically driven song. It serves as a true highlight as well. Feels Like Summer is probably my second favorite featured. 'Instant classic' comes to mind whenever I hear it. A pulsating beat with some pretty intense moments only serve the song more justice. What You Become has a NIN feel to it with a repetative chorus, not my favorite but good for a few listens. Who Asked You creeps along with a certain sensuality to it. I Will goes down as my favorite song featured. The chorus is irresistable, that's basically what it boils down to. Monkey Puzzle Tree kind of grated my nerves at first but now I really like it. Nice lyrics and excellent chorus. Ordinary Girl rounds out the true CD nicely. The chorus is kind of eery due completely to Lucia's vocals. I love the pace of this song. The KMFDM verson of Monkey Puzzle Tree strikes me as more of a reprise than a remix. Either way, it's still a great song.  My favorite songs are So Clever, Fear, Feels Like Summer, I Will, and Ordinary Girl. If you're like me and haven't been properly introduced to Lucia, well this is the perfect way. This CD is truly amazing and I can only hope that when I venture into KMFDM's catalog that they'll impress me as much as Lucia has with From The Land Of Volcanos+music
GET THE ITALIAN VERSION!+N+This is a great CD...in its original language!!!  NEK is an Italian singer.  I'd love to buy this CD, but not in a spanish cover+music
COMPELLING+P+With its flavorful mix of new and original music (but sadly lacking the poignant Laura Nyro songs that made the movie so emotionally resonant), this disc is absolutely worth listening to -- and it has a power all its own.  Recalling the sweetly, deceptively simple movie, it has a folky, sublime, melancholy quality+music
Excellence+P+This is the best CD I have heard in a long time. Even some bums on the street heard me listening to it in my car and just had to ask what it was. R.L Burnside and Lyrics Born are a unique and fabulous collaboration+music
A compilation....+N+Make a mix of Michael's first two solo albums (Michael Schenker Group and MSG), add UFO's &quot;Doctor Doctor&quot; and that's the set list for this live album recorded in Japan. So, the utility of this album is in accord with your preference for live albums or not, because, if you already own hhis first two albums, this album is utterly superfluous. At least the line up is the same of MSG: Barden, Michael, Glen, Raymond and POwell, and they deliver with their customary high skills and professionalism+music
Doesn't work+N+Sorry, this cd just isn't all that and I went and bought it based on the fact that I love Book of Shadows and read the reviews.  BLS earlier stuff is awesome, and I'm into skynyrd and allman bros. and other southern rock as well as heavier music so I thought I'd like this.  I don't, it doesn't work.  Zakk's singing on this just pushes me away, or not sure what it is but the cd sounds like he wants to be Bob Seger - which IMO is NOT a good thing.  Get Book of Shadows, which is excellent, or if you want other mellow metal from Zakk - Hangover Music Vol 6 blows this one away too. +music
Hidden Gem+P+Background: His first five Warner Bros. Records with the original group are 5 stars to me. Then came "Welcome to my Nightmare" (another 5 star in my opinion). "Goes to Hell" slips to four stars, "Lace and Whiskey" slips to two stars, and then he just falls off the radar screen. "From the inside" is more of a Vince Furnier record, "Flush the Fashion" opens strong with a cover of "Talk, Talk" and then "Clones" before the album falls to pieces. "Special Forces" seems totally phony. Then, out of nowhere with the worst (or best) album cover I've ever seen, he delivers "Zipper Catches Skin." This album features the familiar guitar sound of Dick Wagner. The music sounds like vintage Alice (with an 80s edge). But, there's something else here. His vocals have confidence again!! His lyrics are silly, but clever again. The guitar has bite...the album has genuine attitude. That's hard to fake. That's the old Alice! Sadly, this album is the last of the classic Alice Cooper magic. Sure, I witnessed his comeback(s). "Trash" had a moment or two, but not the CLASSIC Cooper sound. Not everything on Zipper works, but most of it rocks.   +music
Let's forget this one happened+N+While it's not quite as horrid as the film of the same name, the WHO'S THAT GIRL? soundtrack is still a rather wretched affair.  Due to Madonna's incredible popularity, this disc managed to hit the Hot 200's Top Ten and reach Platinum status in sales, but it's far from a must-own now.  Madonna contributes four tracks, and they all sound like TRUE BLUE out-takes.   Madonna wrote the big hit "Who's That Girl?" (#1 Pop, #5 Adult Contemporary, #44 Dance) with Patrick Leonard, and it's a virtual rewrite of their own superior "La Isla Bonita."  The wistful ballad "The Look of Love" (also co-written with Leonard) is less derivative, but much more ordinary.  The frantic, Steve Bray-produced dance track "Causing A Commotion" (#2 Pop, #1 Dance) fares much better, and is an undervalued gem in Madonna's singles catalogue.    The only other Madonna cut (the generic "Can't Stop," also produced and co-written by Bray) is an obvious throwaway, yet it is still better than any of the other non-Madonna tracks.  The remaining cuts are by other "artists" (I use that term loosely) and are anonymous and unlistenable.  There's a reason why Duncan Faure and Coati Mundi never went anywhere.+music
Quincy, I Never Had it So Damn Good!+P+Just listen to the piece, ''Love, I Never Had It So Good'' and tell me that this doesn't move you. This is the most creative piece of work I have ever listened to.  I had an  employee of a  vinyl record store play this album and even he was moved by that song.  Luther Vandross sounds so young on ''Sounds...." he really does sounds a bit different than on his later recordings. Vandross comes across as fresh and more soulful back then than he ever did in his 80's recordings. ''Love Me By Name" is just wonderful and I dig the black choir that comes in to accompany Patti Austin.  I have heard other Jones' production but this one takes the cake.  It is the best one I have heard. ''Tell Me a Bedtime Story''moves the hell out of me.  I am not jiving yall.  Please buy this record!! You can't go wrong with Chaka Khan, Ashford and Simpson, Luther Vandross, Herbie Hancock, Patti Austin, and Gwen Gutherie coming together to make a really prolific album. +music
Are you kidding!+N+I can't beleive the amount of good reviews of this CD.  I have most of the Pat Metheny library and this CD is the worst by far.  It was like listening to all of his un-inspired, not-as-good, filler songs in one sitting.  Yuck!  Don't get me wrong, I love Pat Metheny's work, but this CD was just BAD+music
Atrocious Noise Reduction Job+N+I'm appalled this CD is still in print using the same horrid transfers Sony made in 1991. The major label philosophy at that time was, "Eliminate any and all trace of hiss or crackle from the original 78, no matter if it totally kills the music in the process." Great progress has been made since that time in the development of technology to transfer 78s without destroying the music, but has Sony bothered to create a new remaster? No. They are still pressing new CDs from the original 1991 transfers and they sound HORRID. Save your money, I beg of you, and wait for somebody to do this material correctly. This release is a disgrace. +music
beyond praise and time+P+Edith Piaf died in 1963. Her chansons (= French for 'songs') live on. Even stronger than that: the more time passes by, the more one realizes how breathtakingly good they are.   Though definitely set in the mid-20th century, Piaf's voice, style, timbre (= French for 'rhytm') and choice of repertoire effortlessly deal with any passage of time. Setting doesn't matter at all, and the same goes for the limited recording technics of her days.  Being widely recognized as the 'soul of France', Piaf carries her chansons to the most extreme corners of planet earth. Right up to this day. In Europe her 'Non, je ne regrette rien' (= No, I don't regret anything) makes the greatest impact: the 'life goes on'-undertone of this chanson still brings inspiration & courage to millions of her admirers. 'Non, je ne regrette rien' also reflects Piaf's own life: being of very modest origin, she surely had to put up a stiff fight to gain her immortality. She did so by finding her inspiration in a deep & uncompromising love for her native France.  As only a limited part of humanity speaks French, Piaf's achievement is all the more impressive. One should realize Americans & English always have an easy ride: 50% of the world's population speaks their language, while the other half adapts to it for reasons of efficiency.   No, surely any number of stars isn't enough to reflect on Edith Piaf's chansons. Their quality takes this mid-20th century chansonniere beyond praise and time.  +music
Awesome Worship CD!!+P+I truly enjoyed listening to the CD, especially the arrangement of Wrapped Up, Tied Up, Tangled Up and Just For Who You Are.  Earnest is leading us into worship and pouring out his heart.  May God continue to bless and keep him.  MD / Concord Churc+music
Music for the Mozart Effect+P+This CD is a compilation of various tunes geared to stimulate the mind. I really enjoy listening to it+music
addictive listenable dance music+P+I personally don't like repetitive boom*tch-boom*tch-boom*tch type of music that goes on for 10 minutes, erlende oye does a great job of selecting songs that are catchy but doesn't get played out easily. Maybe I'm biased too, i like kings of convenience and royksopp, but this album is very upbeat, funky, yet diverse (Phoenix, Avenue D). There's no categorizing it, electro, house, pop, it's just good catchy beats+music
Weak selections bring the album down+N+Usually the &quot;Grammy Nominees&quot; series produces a compilation in which, understandably, some pieces are way below the others in quality. The 2001 edition suffers more than ever of this syndrome. In fact, quality is truly hard to find on this CD. Under the label of &quot;pop&quot; several unworthy songs somehow find their way into the selections. Hard to understand why, but the few decent tracks merely manage to assert that some effort was actually put into the decision. The variety of genres that appear merely confuse me about what exactly is the purpose of this CD, rather than provide a large field from which to find something that I like. The fact is, it is so broad that a fan of a particular style of music will  be left utterly disappointed. 1)&quot;Say my name&quot; - a normally catchy song that seems out of place on this album. 2)&quot;I try&quot; - decent effort by Macy Gray, but she does not deserve to win a Grammy. 3)&quot;Music&quot; - Madonna's new song is nothing above average. 4)&quot;Bye bye bye&quot; - Usually annoying 'Nsync produce a better to digest single, but no reason to incorporate on this CD. 5)&quot;Beautiful day&quot; - U2's magnificent song, one of the best of the year, is one of the high points on the album. 6)&quot;Sexx laws&quot; - mildly agreeable Beck single similar to most of his work. 7)&quot;The Real Slim Shady&quot; - overplayed Eminem single is great, but no reason to buy this CD; buy his album instead. 8)&quot;Optimistic&quot; - extremely disappointing song from Radiohead; a definite weak point. 9)&quot;You're the one&quot; - Paul Simon's new track is enjoyable at most, but marks musical talent at its best. 10)&quot;Cousin Dupree&quot; - moderately bouncy music by Steely Dan does not justify their win. 11)&quot;What a girl wants&quot; - it is simply shameful to include such kind of bubble gum pop on a respectable compilation 12)&quot;Save me&quot; - very docile and slightly unnerving song from a new artist; decidedly bad choice. 13)&quot;Both sides now&quot; - another uninspired pick; nondescript in every way. 14)&quot;Oops!I did it again!&quot; - Britney is OK, but if she deserved a place at the Grammys, it would have to be for her prevoius album. 15)&quot; Show me the meaning...&quot; - almost disturbing Backstreet Boys have no place in the same room with a Grammy; a ghastly song, truly repulsive. 16)&quot;Pinch me&quot; - the best and the brightest on this album; Barenaked Ladies truly underrated as a band, always producing high quality music. 17)&quot;Breathless&quot; - The Corrs are nothing spectacular, but still bearable. To make a long story short, this album is only for collectors+music
Mozart For Masochists+N+I love Glenn Gould -- when he's playing Bach, that is.  But Gould hated Mozart, and while some of his early Mozart recordings are quite nice, the Mozart recordings he did in the 60's and 70's (i.e., on these discs) were simply bizarre. And not in a good way. They are exhibitions in spite, and spite is not fun to listen to.  Granted, some of the slow movements are played beautifully -- but there's more to Mozart than slow movements.  The fast movements (i.e., two thirds of the music in the average sonata) are a horror.    If you want to hear Gould at his eccentric best, buy anything he did with Bach -- or his Haydn albums, his early Beethoven sonatas (avoid Sonata No. 23, though), his Sibelius, Scriabin, Schoenberg or his Byrd & Gibbons albums.  But stay clear of Mozart. +music
Superb lyrics and music - lifeless sound+N+No doubt, these lyrics and music are superb; after all, this is why I purchased this CD.  What wonderful memories!  But, this particular CD's sound quality is lifeless and dimensionless.  I didn't intend for this CD to be simply background music, as I like to become "drawn into" the recording, but that's all I can do.  What a disappointment!  I have ordered many wonderful CD's from Amazon that sound great, but felt compelled to write and warn others.   I give this CD at 5-star rating for its lyrics and music, but only a 1-star for it's sound quality.  With engineering like this, its no wonder so many would rather use free music-sharing services on the Internet rather than make a purchase+music
Old Recordings Rehashed Into A New CD.+N+Very disappointing, It's just old recordings rehashed onto a new CD and I heard that LeAnn who is a wonderful singer didn't even have any say about this CD being released! Also there aren't enough patriotic songs! I really hope that LeAnn makes a new CD of all newly recorded Patriotic songs and another one that is all Inspirational Gospel songs+music
Chaotic Metal: Definitely An Acquired Taste+P+I got a good laugh out of the sticker on the corner of "Everything Is Alive..." that read something like "For Fans of Opeth, Unearth, and ASHLEE SIMPSON". A band on Solid State Records that sounds like  a mediocre pop "star"? Yeah right; this band definitely has sense of humor.  When I first played the CD, I listened to the first track all the way through. I absolutely hated it. I then skipped through all the other tracks and listened to about 30 seconds of each. More of the same. I couldn't believe that I had wasted my money on this pile of slow-paced loud noisy garbage.  The guitar feedback grated on my eardrums, and I ended up with a massive headache. Needless to say, I took a break from The Chariot for a while.  A few weeks later, however, the song "Die Interviwer" popped up on my mp3 player's random shuffle, so I listened to the whole song. I could actually tolerate it. Soon, I started listening to more and more songs from the album, and I was amazed by the realness of the sound, and the incredible brutality of it all: the ripping guitars, the pounding drums, and the lead singer, who roars like a man possessed. I listened to the album all the way through, and I was hooked.   The Chariot is a truly incredible band, and is nothing like I've ever heard before. They draw a listener in more than Norma Jean ever will.  They are just as amazingly brutal in concert, also. However, a word of warning: You cannot just start listening to this band. A love of metal is required, and you have to be open to new styles. I would recommend listening to bands such as Becoming the Archetype before picking this album up. But it is well worth it; listening to The Chariot is a breathtaking experience+music
Nothing Compared to the original+N+Sorry but this album is nothing compared to the original by andrew. The depth of voice of the lead singer is lacking and the orcherster is half a sleep I was very disapointed by this album. I STRONGLY reccomend the orignal instead+music
An unfortunate production+N+The "Hardest Thing" I've ever had to do Is listen to this cd, February 28, 2005 Recently I had the misfortune to be given this cd by a homeless man. I was coming home from my job at the paper clip factory, where I put paper clips into cardboard boxes, when I passed a man asking for spare change. I apologized because I had none to give him, and he handed me this cd. "Take this," he said in his grizzled wino voice. "I tried to sell it to make money for food but no one would buy it."  So I brought the disc home and put it into my cd player while I was cooking dinner for myself and my seventeen dogs and also my latest mistress, Angela Adams. I wish I had not put it in the cd player, because the music that came out was really not that good.  Imagine if the Backstreet Boys met O-Town for dinner, and the four least talented decided to step into the alleyway beside the restaurant for a few minutes and began to scat. N'Sync hears the racket and pops in to see if their services are needed, but Nick Lachey steps forward and says, "No, N'Sync! Go away! We don't want any danceable beats or r&b flava in our music!" So Justin Timberlake and crew slink back into the empty garage next door to practice their moonwalks.  Not only is the 98 Degrees music boring, but an examination of the cd itself reveals more issues.  1. The font which is used to write the words "And Rising" is an unfortunate choice. The components of the "d" in "and" are not joined as tightly as they might be, so the "d" looks like an "al." This changes the name of the album significantly.  2. The boys are standing in front of a wall of fire, which I assume is supposed to be a reference to their name, 98 Degrees, which is a warm temperature. However, any idiot knows that fire is much hotter than 98 Degrees. Human beings are hotter than 98 Degrees, usually by about .6 degrees, and they BURN when put into fire. In fact, 98 Degrees the temperature is not that hot, just like 98 Degrees the performing group.  3. Several of the members appear to have gotten tattoos of the band's name on their arms. How lame is that? Can you imagine if people in all bands did that? I bet Emma Bunton would feel really lame right now, what with the Spice Girls having broken up and become completely irrelevant to pop culture. What's that? 98 Degrees is no more? No one buys their music? Nick Lachey is best known as Mr. Jessica Simpson? Ha ha! Bet you're glad you got that tattoo now, sucker!  I recommend you not buy this cd. Buy anything else instead. I hear Britney Spears is genius+music
Full Metal Jacket+P+Full metal jacket is by far one of the best movies I have ever seen.  Although the language is too strong for many people (not for me), it definately puts the point across about the harsh life of Marines during  training on the Island.  The sniper scene is very well done as well.   Gunnery Sergeant Hartman is portrayed by an excellent actor who is able to  scream obscenities at his troops without even cracking a smile, I would  like to see the bloopers reel from Full Metal Jacket+music
It hurt my ears+N+I have just listened to the samples available online, and being a native spanish speaker, the gramatical errors I have heard hurt my ears. I am also bringing up my baby bilingual english/spanish, and as someone mentioned in a previous review, mixing the two lenguages goes against the expert's advice, as it creates confusion for the baby+music
ocean's 12 soundtrack+N+expected something much better-  the actual music from the movie instead of instrumental+music
A G-Unit Breakdown+N+If you're looking for good Aftermath-produced or G-Unit affiliated music, here's which artists to go to and which to stay far, far away from:   50 Cent-- Go nowhere near The Massacre. You're 5% more likely to suffer a slow, painful death just by touching the case. It is the worst CD you could possibly ever hear. Same thing goes with the movie soundtrack.  Get Rich or Die Tryin (the original) on the other hand, is solid... especially on those bonus tracks (Heaven, Life on the Line, U Not Like Me), Patiently Waiting, 21 Questions, and anything featuring another G-Unit member. PIMP, with its lack of Snoop Dogg (which the music video seemed to promise), High All the Time, Many Men, and Wanksta can kind of get old though.  The thing about 50 Cent these days is that by himself he is no longer any good at all. He needs to be held up by a crutch of some better rapper before he can make good with his own rap. The reason he succeeds so well in his collaborations with The Game in The Documentary and Eminem in The Re-Up is because he has actually GOOD rappers holding him up. He's like the Abbott of the comedians Abbott & Costello now. He has nothing worth contributing without his Costello of some kind to be there for him.   The Game-- As soon as I heard this guy's album and compared it to 50's Massacre, I knew that if G-Unit was going anywhere, this guy would be the one to take it there. And now it turns out he left. Can't blame him when the clique-label's leader is so dumb. Was the most progressive rapper of the crew, and his reason for leaving is probably because of how anti-progressive 50's Massacre was. Has the best, deepest subject matter within his songs, if not the best flow (Although his underground 300 Bars song would automatically crown him king if he did that well all the time on his main albums). As far as the mainstream and not underground CDs go though, I'd give him a 2nd best for flow of the G-Unit crew.  His Documentary album has been called the third Chronic, and has the best of Dre's beats you'll find on any G-Unit CD. Criticisms are that he name-drops Dre & NWA a bit too much, but overall, I think it's not that big of a deal. He's a big hip-hop history fan, and he's still a little starstruck over the chance of being able to work with Dre. Given a very brief profile of the rapper, he fits into an uncomfartable stereotype, (average-looking rapper from Compton who's been shot a few times), but he immediately carves a personality of his own in the Doctor's Advocate and his even better The Documentary.   Young Buck-- I'd say probably the best G-Unit member still in G-Unit. This guy has the best flow, as far as mainstream CDs are concerned. He also seems to be the 2nd-most concerned about the world (a.k.a. 'progressive'), with references to the Illuminati amongst other secret organizations. I like this guy the best of the remaining G-Unit. 2nd best comes sort of close to him, but still doesn't match Buck's raw skills.  Lloyd Banks-- This guy is second best. His flow skills somewhat tie for 2nd place with The Game's, or at least land in that area. He, Buck, and The Game are my top three for G-Unit (even though The Game's not G-Unit anymore). Anybody else you can probably pass up. I'll go over them real quick just to make sure you know who the others are beforehand.    Tony Yayo-- The one male member who is worse than 50 Cent. In the G-Unit CD, they always shouted 'Free Yayo!' and now he is free. The G-Unit had done a terrible thing by campaigning for his release. His is of no benefit whatsoever to them. He might even be responsible for the gradual dumbening of 50's style & outlook on life.   Joe-- The kind of R&B star you'd expect to sing chorus or backup on an Outkast track, mixed with a bit of R. Kelley and a very small splash of Stevie W. He's not bad I guess. I hated him completely on 'Wanna Get to Know You' of the G-Unit CD, but would definitely still listen to his 'Ride Wit U' track off his own solo album.   Olivia-- Pssh, are you dumb? No. She's partially responsible for Candy Shop. That should be reason enough to hate her full-on and never turn back. She kind of can't sing either. Bad move to make an R&B CD without being able to sing, I think.  Lil' Scrappy-- This is the same Lil' Scrappy you heard on Lil' Jon's "What U Gon Do?" track. He's pretty good. Decent at least. Definitely not as decent as 50 Cent's original Get Rich or Die Tryin, but decent. He's got a good enough style though that places him above everyone else still in G-Unit, excluding Lloyd Banks and Young Buck, but including 50 Cent by himself.   I think that's everybody. So... now you know all about G-Unit, and who's good and who's not. If you HAVE to buy G-Unit, now you know who to avoid and who to embrace. If you plan on buying the original Get Rich or Die Tryin, I suggest you don't. Burn it, or have a friend burn it for you. 50 doesn't need the money right now or ever again. If you decide not to buy G-Unit, then more power to you. The Game is actually now sort of the anti-G-Unit since he left, because, you know, the majority of their members still suck.  I'd suggest Mos Def's Black on Both Sides instead of any of this stuff though... even if you were planning on buying G-Unit. That's probably the best hip-hop album I've ever heard, or will hear+music
love it!+P+that's all i have to say. plain and simple.  dr. thompson's cds have a made a postive impact on my life so much so that i have gone out and purchased more and more.   the delta 2 cd has helped me attain sleep quicker and more restful than ever.  i prefer the 2nd theta cd for meditation but will listen to the first for more creative mediation and thinking.  i am now a devoted fan. and can not say enough about the effectiveness of the good doctor's work+music
Derek Trucks-Songlines+N+This CD was very disappointing. The guitar rifs were sloppy and there were maybe two songs that were worthy of the purchase+music
Electric Cafe+P+Electric Cafe was a very much delayed project and was originally called Technopop and should have included the awesome single Tour de France. After years of frustration and innuendo the album was finally released in 1986. It is way of ahead of its time in its use of sampling, loops and the way they use their keyboards. it has 6 awesome tracks on it starting with boing boom tshak and ending with the hypnotic electric cafe, Sex Object is the best track on the entire cd with amazing beats, lyrics and a melody that is quite accomplished. The book-let is typical Kraftwerk with very little information and odd looking photographs. The graphics may look basic today (2005), but back in 1986 this was cutting edge and if one used computers back then, then one knows how advanced these graphics truly were for their time. This is a great album from Kraftwerk. It is just a shame that they record so seldom these days+music
K-ci & JoJo Greatest Fan+P+First of all, a lot of people are wondering where have these guys been?  They were recently in a play entitled Guilty until proven innocent.   This album was great-good for when your making love.  But it should have included at least four new songs on it.   And they are suppose to be coming out with a greatest hit DVD.   I don't think its out yet, have anyone purchased it+music
The Most Overrated Classical Recording of All Time. It's Still Good Though...+P+This ultra famous recording of the the Beethoven Fifth and Seventh is absurdly overpraised. I'm not going to be a Mr. Know-It-All and attack these performances just because people love them, I'm just going to try to be fair and impartial and get at the core of why these recordings shouldn't be deemed so unsurpassable.  Kleiber is an exceptional conductor and he knows exactly what he is doing, his penchant for drama, attack and drive, work well with these two symphonies but they miss quite a bit too. The VPO for instance is a great orchestra but they don't always rise to the challenge here. I want to pay particular attention to the sound of these recordings which is simply not that great. It's servicable, actually typical Deutsche Grammophon sound from the mid-70s. It's cold, at times harsh and stringy. The opening of the last movement of the 5th symphony is shrill, there is no resplendent majesty here like you get in Karajan's 1962 version or Guilini's version from the early 80's with the LAPO.   Kleiber's first movement is fast, intense but lacks the ultimate power I heard in the Karajan and Giulini versions. The second movement is good, Kleiber doesn't rush things, the scherzo is terrific, the transition to the finale doesn't have much mystery, certainly not the heaven storming insanity that Furtwangler brings to it in his war-time recording from the 1940's. Kleiber is also very literal in his observation of repeats in these works. Repeats everywhere you can find them is typically the norm in recent times. The repeat in the first movement is a must, obviously every conductor takes it but the finale repeat is a matter of choice. Kleiber of course takes it and it's to his credit that the movement doesn't drag as it might under someone else. Giulini's last movement does drag because he takes a slower tempo along with the repeat. Karajan on the other hand, never took the finale repeat in any of his versions, from 50s, 60s, 70s and 80s! All the Karajan versions fly to the finish with unbelievable, exhilarating force! So with Giulini or Kleiber, you're more exhausted by the end of the symphony, with Karajan, you're on cloud nine, ecstatic because of the power of the Berlin Philharmonic and because he skips the redundant repeat. Of course Kleiber's version is terrific but I would not give it this high of a status among classical recordings. Here are the best Beethoven 5ths, any Karajan version, especially the '62 and '77, the later 80's digital version is extremely powerful too but not as well played as the earlier versions. They all do pack quite a punch. Giulini with the LAPO is among the best, then Carlos Kleiber is up there in that great company as well, but not the definitive at all. If you want a Furtwangler 5th, of course there is the war-time performance to go to. It has a slow first movement but the rest of the work is majestic beyond words. Unfortunately you have to deal with the mono sound, even though it's not that bad.  The 7th symphony is a tricky one and I've never been completely convinced by any version that I've heard. Kleiber once again takes all the damn repeats! It's ok in the first movement, but he takes one too many in the scherzo and he takes the repeat in the final movement which makes things way too repetitive, many conductors used to skip this repeat but Kleiber is so bloody literal minded! Karajan's versions of the 7th are just too driven for my taste, even though Karajan's finales have always been the best! The fast speed works well in the finale. Kleiber is less driven than Karajan and Carlos is also more humane in the Allegreto. However, all these versions just don't spark me too much. Furtwangler on the other hand is outstanding but of course you have to deal with the old mono sound. You can find his version on the Music and Arts label. In addition, check out the very weighty, traditional approach of Christian Thielemann with the Philharmonia Orchestra on a recent Beethoven record, with great sound that easily surpasses the sound of the Kleiber and Karajan recordings.  What you ultimately have here in Kleiber, is pretty intense, terrific performances but with some catches involved. The sound is not great, the Vienna Philharmonic lacks the unbelievable virtuosity of the Berlin Philharmonic and Kleiber insists on all the repeats just like most recent conductors and that tends to make things drag in the 7th symphony. All reservations aside, they are still great performances but this is surely not the holy grail of classical recordings!+music
Roxy Music is the drug.+P+This collection is older, but it's 20 tracks long, and does include most of the essential Roxy/Ferry songs. Included amongst all these killer songs is "Love Is The Drug", "More Than This", "Avalon", and "Slave To Love". It would truly be impossible to fit everything on one disc, but the only things I really miss is Roxy's "Mother Of Pearl", and Ferry's "Kiss And Tell" and "Limbo". Otherwise it actually does a great job as a "best of". This being currently out of print however, you may have to hit the used stores, or deal with another "hits" album.  +music
One of, if not the best electronic music album ever made+P+My title for this review may sound a bit over the top, but rest assured, it is not an exaggeration. This music was composed using a synth that the Berrons built themselves (this was before you could buy a synth) and composed this music for the sci-fi film. Whether you like the movie or not, this music stands on it's own. Brilliant compositions and beautiful, innovative electronics that interestingly enough, despite all the resources and technology available now, easily surpass most electronic work being done today. For fans of good, serious electronic music (and by good I DON'T mean techno or some crap like that), this is essential music. Do not miss out on this masterpiece+music
the worst of GM+N+This is a very simple review.  Call it a warning.  This album by GM is cheesy, period.  The squeaky vocals and the weak synth lines are far inferior to GM's other album, "From Here to Eternity."  On that cd, the tracks are very trancy, features electro vocals and nice chord changes.  The beat is stronger and harder.  Especially good, besides the title track, is track #6: "First Hand Experience in Second Hand Love."  Excellent techno riff that lacks the cheesey vocals, dated Expose sound effects and stabs.   It just rolls and rolls and rolls.  Nice driving cd.  However, E=MC2 is a cd to pass on.  I was very disappointed.  One more note, this album sounds old and dated.  "Eternity" could still work a dancefloor now.  No one would think it's almost 30 years old+music
best in a long time+P+this is one of the best CDs I have purchased in a long time. Very raw and emotional. A great, great find+music
Birtney Spears has not yet broken out of her shell+N+Sure,this cover can say she looks good and trying to look hot.She's trying so hard to give off an image that's not her.She's being and mostly acts like a tramp.Have you seen her videos?  Brintey can not break out of her shell and between the rebelious and outrageous lyrics,I see a sad girl being consumed by the media.Sure,she laughs and she looks as if she is having a good time on her videos but come on!Briney hides behind her clothes and lyrics and her record deal.It's all tenn pop lyrics penned down on her notepad while she's waiting in line!  I am dissapointed and I hope she writes better songs but from the heart,go Britney!Britney rock on please!+music
Face The Facts People+N+Kool Keith=Nasty Ass, weird Lyrics with a horrible flow, and on this CD they suck even more to craptastic beats... Have Fun+music
George's Sleeping Pill+N+George Harrison had incredible talents that inspired the world. He was not only a member of the Beatles but he was also one of the writers. In his solo career he sang along side of Bob Dylan and other greats in the "Concert for Bangladesh".  . . . So just what happened?   How did this man who soared with the eagles suddenly take a nose dive and swim in the turkey droppings? How could such a winner like George Harrison create such a loser of a solo album?   My guess, maybe, it was his divorce with Patti Boyd at the time. Perhaps it may have been because of his laryngitis, but that had already healed after he made his "Dark Horse" album. But whatever the reason, his other albums take off to the skies while this one crashes into a tree. Harrison plagiarizes his own material with "This Guitar Can't Keep From Crying" which is pitiful excuse for "While My Guitar Gently Weeps". If you have a small child that cannot go to sleep, just play him this song at night and the problem will be solved.   The best song this album is "You" which is horribly mediocre but the only one that is not boring. The song "His Name is Legs" could have been a good hard rock song except that it was too repetitious and you would still get bored after the first half. The rest of the album is a giant sleeping pill.  No need for over the counter insomnia medicine! Play this record before you go to bed and have a great night's sleep!     +music
Beautiful Music+P+Two long time friends together, reminiscing and playing absolutely beautiful blues and ballads.  If &quot;New Orleans Blues&quot; or &quot;Stormy Weather&quot; don't bring a tear to your eye, then you need to  check with a doctor to see if you are still alive.  Why the Amazon sales  rank on this CD is so low is beyond my comprehension.  Wonderful recording  quality.  These recordings along with the other in this series are among  Lonnie Johnson and Elmer Snowden's finest --amazing since both are  considered to have peaked performance wise in the late 20s/early 30s+music
the best+P+This is the Allman Brothers BEST, I don't need to go on. Just own it+music
Supposed Former Alanis Fan+N+Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie is one of the most eccentric albums to have been released in the 90's. Nobody can dismiss it as a complete failure because it genuinely does have its moments. But then of course there are songs like "Front Row" or "One" (to name just a few) that are shamelessly self-indulgent and should never have been released to the commercial public. The problem with Alanis, is that she has never been able to leave some things to a listener's imagination. What helped "Jagged Little Pill" become one of the ten best-selling albums of all time in the United States is that the lyrics were personal, but generic enough to still spark the fascination of listeners. In the case of "Supposed Former," the lyrics are painstakingly overwritten well beyond the point of gratuitousness and rather than follow a coherent format, they meander. This sort of no-holds-barred lyrical approach suits certain songs--"Baba," "Thank U," "The Couch," and "So Pure" at least adhere their obscure lyrics to a structured melody. If all art is valid, then everyone should have a painting hanging up in the Louvre, but the sign of a true artist is one who can temper their artistic integrity in a manner that engages others. "Jagged Little Pill" was a catchy, poignant, emotive masterpiece that struck a nerve with tens of millions of people. "Supposed Former," on the other hand, is far too self-involved and should have remained in the pages of Alanis' diary; where such clumsy, wordy, overreaching attempts at poetry belong. Unfortunately, this killed whatever momentum "Jagged Little Pill" had created and permanently closed the door on Alanis for tens of millions of fans+music
Brava Sarah!+P+This is undoubtedly my favorite CD of the last decade and definitely Sarah Brightman's best effort to date!  Her duets with Andrea Bocelli and Jose Cura are outstanding!  I especially love 'O mio babbino caro', Alleluja', and 'La Wally'. Sarah's uniquely sensual style is evident in the incredibly beautiful 'Bilitis - Generique', 'No One Like You' and 'Just Show Me How To Love You'.  Close your eyes and drift away...  It is highly unusual for me to like every song on a CD, but on 'Time to Say Goodbye', I do.  It has a unique way of making me feel completely relaxed while encouraging me to sing along at the same time.  It's long past time for a sequel to this wonderful album+music
Edited Rhino's specialty+N+2 stars only because Rhino used single version and not the original long version.  Why do they do this?    When I read a book I read all of it not just part of it, the same is true with a song. +music
F*ck the Frog+N+I love jazz, really. But candidly speaking, Bud Powell's frog croaking vocalizations ruin just about every damn piece of music he's ever been involved with! I just want to strangle him whenever he starts that crap in one of his tunes. Why did he feel the need to do that? Didn't he realize he was destroying his music as he recorded it? I'm sorry to offend folks, but an idiot Powell was, a complete idiot. He blew it+music
DEFINITELY A MUST HAVE, MAN!!!!!+P+look here, i knew that there was more to this band than EXPRESS YOURSELF.  this cd more than satisfied that.  everything on here bumps.  i can do without the slow stuff, but overall, mr. wright and company DID THEY THANG!!!!!  UHHHHH!!!!  i love charles' voice; especially on YOUR LOVE (MEANS EVERYTHING TO ME).  that stands out because it sounds like his voice was all shot and he still found something in it to deliver.  if you like true blue funkiness, then get this.  it is cats and bands like this that never get played on the radio, which sucks, that really bring that sausage gravy vibe.  you will understand that latter once you cop this or download it+music
Regarding full-length "Dazz" by Brick+N+I bought "Old School - Vol. 2" specifically to get the full-length version of Dazz by Brick, among other songs.  I was disappointed and angry that it was the 5 min. radio version.  After reading your reviews here, I'm glad I didn't choose to get the Best of Brick.  Though I enjoy other songs by Brick, Dazz is my all-time favorite.  Today I found the long version on the "Disco Super Hits" CD.  Though I'm not crazy about other songs on this CD it's worth the money.  I will be playing my Dazz over and over with my sun-roof open, a smile on my face, and the wind blowing free in my hair!  :-+music
No long version of Dazz here+N+Have you ever heard a song that finds its way into your head, going round and round and round - but you can't place the title of it, or the group ?  So it was with me, and "Dazz", put out by a group called "Brick" in the 70s.   Imagine my delight when I heard a similar track on my XM car radio, which displays the title and group of every song played.   A little research, and, voila, I had found the origin of that song which was playing in my memory.....but, alas, the song in my memory was approximately 15 minutes long, with absolutely tremendous flute and bass solo's.   I ordered the "Best of Brick".....imagine my disappointment when it turned out to be the 3-minute version of the song.   Subsequent research on the web, and Amazon, indicates that there is currently NO cd with the long track of Dazz.  A real shame.  If you're looking for the long version of Dazz, don't waste your money on this CD.  +music
Lame and embarassing+N+Well I am a bit jaded because I live in a city where everybody talks and looks like Larry The Cable guy. If the people here don't resemble him then they resemble Ned Flanders from The Simpsons.  So I get to put up with both extremes in real life. Why would anybody want to pay for this load of nonsense unless you are from a real sophisticated state or city and this to you is hilarious because you are laughing at how lame this obese comedian is. The blue collar TV show was mildly funny. This CD on the other hand is not funny.  It isn't even crude or offensive.  This humor is childish and bad and possibly young kids would think it was funny for a week but most adults wouldn't buy into this stuff for a minute.    +music
Completely disappointed+N+After hearing Ice Box I was very excited to hear the rest of the album. This album was supposed to be somewhat dark and haunting. Exactly what Ice Box contains. A dark and haunting melody. The rest of the album is completely trash. So if you read this. You're best buying the single for Ice Box+music
What a Disappointment+N+Overall, this is nothing more than a bunch of entrance themes for the WWF; if you don't believe me, just ask Edge. In my opinion, there is not one good song on this entire CD, and I have been a huge fan of Rob and White Zombie in the past. Rob, please go back to making good music and refrain from making garbage like this+music
Reality Check+N+I have a fairly extensive collection of comedy albums, and I gatta say this is probably one of the lamest I've ever heard. If you enjoy hearing a one-line joke dragged out to 5-6 minutes (like the worst episodes of SNL), then maybe this is tolerable. maybe ONCE. The people giving this high ratings are either Norm's friends or people too young to have experienced true wit. Trust me, if you listen to this once you will probably never play it agai+music
Disgusting!+N+Thought this CD would be funny after seeing it promoted on John Daily's Show. We tried everywhere to find it and finally found it on Amazon. What a letdown we had after finally receiving it and listening to it. This was a total waste of our money. It wasn't funny at all - would probably call it sick or stupid. Thought this guy was a comedian - he must be on his downhill slide.  He isn't funny at all!  Please don't waste your money on this one. +music
did't play+N+I tried it in a cd player dvd player computer came up blank now i've givin up  this is the first time this has happen+music
out of this world+P+this album would have the 5 stars it deserves if it weren't for Mr. Feng nit-picking about technical stuff.  if you don't want all the extra versions of tunji you can go out to any music store and get the original version for $12.    "out of this world" is the most profoundly beautiful musical statement I have ever heard, from any artist, in any genre.  that track alone makes it worth the price of admission.   +music
not so good+N+I think that this album of Natalie is not so good; there are many songs that in their original versions (Criminal by Fiona Apple, If I ever lose my faith in you by Sting, Day dreaming by Aretha Frankin)were very good songs, while Natalie, in her interpretations, make them much more "pop" than they were before; "pop" in the sense that Natalie's interpretations are more commercial and easy. I don't like this album very much; the only song that I consider good is You gotta be+music
Controversial and Classic!!!!!+P+Wow!  After reading the reviews on Amazon for this cd, I can tell that above anything else, Natalie Cole stirs a lot of emotion in her audience.  It's a rare quality that inspires others to speak out the way everyone has on this controversial cd!  From that hot wailing vocal in the opening song "Criminal" to the searing gospel version of "If I Ever Lose My Faith In You", this collection is a WINNER!!!  Natalie has tackled various genres and made them her definitive version of each song.  She is funky in "Old Man", soulful in "Day Dreaming", and haunting in "The Man With The Child In His Eyes".  I can't help but feel that these song writers would not only give her a nod, but the Grammy award as well!  You can count me in when Natalie comes to town in concert.  I can't wait to see her perform these songs and more!  Thank you Natalie!  I can't say that you're "back", because you simply never went away+music
splendid+P+I've never heard such delicate and beautiful playing of Bach's Well Tempered Clavier such as this.  Schiff coaxes the most incredibly sweet sounds out of his piano and gives these works a new dimension.  Some of the  tempi in the fugues are slower than those of Gould's survey, as indicated  by the reviewer below, but his phrasing is so flowing and smooth that it  becomes more hypnotic and the listener becomes entranced by it.  Add to the  fact that the sound is remarkably full with just the right amount of  resonance without compromising clarity (compared to Gould's discs which  offer impressive crispness but is rather dry in tone) this set is  satisfying in every way+music
I wish I could rate zero stars+N+I bought this CD last Friday and knew I had made a mistake within 30 seconds of the 1st song. I only made it through the 4th track before removing it from my CD player and returning to the store to exchange it. I can respect complex time changes, but being good at math does not make for good music. I heard nothing that could be considered a melody and also nothing that sounded like actual instrumental talent. They may know how to play their instruments, but they do not know HOW to play. Also, the production is terrible. The praise of this album strikes me as some kind of joke. It's that bad. If you want to listen to instrumental rock/metal made by talented muscians who know how to play and write music that is not painfull to listen to, check out Gordian Knot "Emergent."+music
UB40 The Best of+N+I ordered this CD specifically for Red, Red Wine and the whole song isn't even on there!  I was VERY disappointed.  Best song they ever recorded and I wasted my money trying to get it.  Don't get this CD if you like that song+music
5 Star Music...But This Can't Be Rudy's Best Remastering+P+Overall, this remaster is very good.  But I have a 1983 Japanese LP issue of A NIGHT AT BIRDLAND that blows Rudy's away.  Check out the alternate of "Wee Dot" on this CD--for the love of Clifford, Art Blakey's cymbal rips our ear drums, and ruins Clifford's solo, which is actually the better solo of the two takes.  You know something?  I question wrether this really is the great Rudy's remastering, especially when you consider this:  when asked, in a 1986 interview on NPR, what his regrets are, without hesitation he replied, "Not having the technology back then to accurately reproduce Clifford Brown's trumpet sound" (wow, as great as Clifford sounds on record, we will never really hear him).  Anyone with such love for Clifford could not have done such lousy remastering on the "Wee-Dot" alternate (I think producer Michael Cuscuna just puts Rudy's name on many of these).  I do want to note, the absolutely essential "Once in a While," Clifford's greatest ballad next to "Ghost of a Chance," sounds much better than on previous domestic issues, and alone is worth many times the price of these volumes.    I think these RVG issues are little more than another of Michael Cuscuna's re-marketing strategies.  Geeze, how many times does he expect us to buy these same titles?  But we do!  We get suckered in, thinking these will be the best-sounding yet--just because they were remastered by Rudy Van Gelder himself.  How many issues, how many years, does it take to get it right?  For the Japanese, it takes just once.  They had it right as far back as 1985, when they issued the Prestige Jazz Masterpieces series--gorgeous sound!  (Compare those 1985 CDs, if you're lucky enough to own any, to the currently available harsh and brittle sounding domestic OJC CDs of the same sessions.)  Japanese Blue Notes always sound magnificent--perfect.  Very simply put, they are the best documentation of the masters on earth.  I know the jazz CD market is nothing like the trillion dollar pop CD market; Blue Note and Mosaic are probably barely keeping above water. Thus repackaging the same music every few years is probably necessary to keep the Blue Note catalog in existence (remember the days, just before CDs, when Blue Note LPs were simply no longer available...except from Japan?). And from reading Cuscuna's liner notes, I do believe he has a passion for this music. But remastering the domestic Blue Notes to, by design, make them sound inferior to, or at least very different from, the pristine Japanese Blue Notes is taking marketing strategy too far.    I have this strong suspicion that Rudy did not actually remaster all of these in the RVG series.  If you ask me, many of these RVGs are nothing more than previously shelved, unscheduled reissues and/or repackaged Connoisseur series issues--compare sometime to Connoisseus you may already own and you'll hear what I mean.  All in all, there is some sort of racket going on between Cuscuna and the Japanese.  Think about it:  Why, after all these years, after all those issues--Blue Note, Connoisseur, Ultimate, Gold, 16-Bit, RVG--why do the Japanese CDs still sound superior?  (By the way, they're not always priced at $35--you now can find Japanese Blue Notes as low as $14.29.)  And, while I'm at it, how many times have you purchased "The Complete," only to discover a new issue with additional material?  The answer to both those questions is simple:  Michael Cuscuna knows what he's doing.  I've not yet heard a Japanese RVG, but I'd bet if you compared one to a domestic RVG of the SAME title, you'd like the Japanese audio better.  If I'm right, that would prove, this RVG marketing ploy is a crock.  What, Rudy would master it differently for the Japanese?   IMPORTANT NOTE: if you buy any of these RVGs, be sure to grab the two volumes of Thelonious Monk. These include the 1951, pre-RVG Blue Notes recorded by Doug Hawkins at WOR studios on lacquer discs, not tape. In remastering these sessions, Rudy applied a process by which the disc surface noise is now just about eliminated, and he brought out much detail and nuance--these Monk RVGs are really so incredible that previous issues are now simply obsolete. By the way, as the notes indicate, the sessions are complete, and "Four in One" and its alternate take are included even though the tray card track sequence is all out of whack and does not show the alternate of "Four in One." GET THESE--can't emphasize it enough. On the other hand, on PERFECT TAKES, the sample cut from Hank Mobley's SOUL STATION is in mono--why ever would Rudy remaster his originally stereo recording in mono!?+music
HOw about a band has to actually be good to havea hits cd?+N+How can you even have a hits cd considering they had no decent music or hits to begin with?  I listened to the entire cd and couldnt find a single song worth listening to for more than 8 seconds.   This CD is full of horrible songs and now i have to have surgery to stop my ears from bleeding+music
Under da Sea+P+We actually own the CD that was originally released when the movie was first released.  It is one of our favorites.  I'm not sure what several others are talking about when they say this one has the origninal score.  The CD's have the same exact music, with the exception of the 2nd CD.  As for the songs on the 2nd CD, we have heard several on Radio Disney.  They are okay once you get passed the whole remake issue.  I actually enjoy the Jonas Brothers version of Poor Unfortunate Souls. +music
First DGG album--very promising+P+Anna Netrebko has rapidly become a first tier star in opera.  This album, her first at DGG, illustrates why some rate her so highly; it also illustrates some of the questions that some have raised about her.  All in all, though, a very nice CD.  A few selections illustrate:  Mozart, Idomeneo, "Quando avran fine omai."  She displays a rich and clean voice.  There is a very attractive quality to her voice manifest in this work.  Mozart, Don Giovanni, "Crudele? Ah no, mio bene!...Non mi dir."  This is Donna Anna's poignant aria, given her circumstances.  Netrebko displays rich tones.  This is a well sung cut.  "Non mi dir" shows off some agility in her voice.  Donizetti, Lucia di Lammermoor.  "Ancor non giunse!. . .Regnava nel silenzio. . .Quando rapito in estasi"  Something of a disappointment.  Coloratura is not her forte (and see her "Sempre Libera" CD for further confirmation).  She clearly shows off a rich and lush voice.  I think that she displays some characterization here that is compelling.  She hits high notes cleanly.  But her ornamentation is indifferent, and she appears unable to trill.  I know, some say that that is irrelevant. But compare Beverly Sills' version of this work, with almost too many trills extraordinarily well sung and her florid technique, and this version simply pales.  Bellini, La Sonnambula.  "Care compagna. . .Come per me sereno."  Again, Netrebko displays a rich voice.  She displays an agile voice and the ability to hit the high notes.  Her rendition of "come per sereno" is spirited.  Gounod, Faust. "The Jewel Song." Very smooth singing; animated singing.  But the technique does not measure up to Anna Moffo's version--let alone Joan Sutherland's.  Puccini, La Boheme.  "Musetta's Waltz."  Yikes!  What a version.  Brava Netrebko.  Her darker voice is very well suited to this.  The characterization of Musetta seems on the mark.  A wonderful cut.  All in all, this shows the promise of Netrebko.  It also indicates where her strengths are and where she does not do so well (coloratura work).  However, this is a very nice introduction to her work and her art.+music

Like Jon Mayer? You'll LOVE JAK+P+Wow. I have both of Jak's CDs. Each is awesome. Extremely well done - lyrics, music, tone...wow. I can't wait until a third album. I can't get enough. He's my new favorite singer-songwriter. You WILL NOT be disappointed with this purchase.+music
Typically Bacharach...+P+... loved this record all my life. I'm in my mid-30's now but fondly remember this from the early Seventies, when my Mum used to play it at my Grandparents house. It evokes some very warm memories... vaguely remember watching the film on TV too but it must have been a very long time ago.  Bacharach's trademark orchestration runs throughout the album, the sudden burst of trumpet on the opening track followed by a crescendo as the strings come in made me fill up with tears... I hadn't heard this album since I was about ten and it seemed as fresh as yesterday!   The instrumental break in 'Share the Joy' as the strings rise to a real high point never fail to make the hairs stand up on my arms, what a lovely lovely piece of music.  The vocal performances too... flawed as they are, are perfect for the songs... they seem more natural and 'human' than some perfect operatic performance. Sally Kellerman's vocal is a great example of this.   I'd always assumed that Peter Finch, Liv Ullmann, Olivia Hussey et al had actually performed the songs but now thanks to the superb sleeve notes I now know better... it shattered my illusions a little but hey... it still SOUNDS as if it's a stage actor trying his best to sing on 'It Might Frighten Her Away' and I LOVE IT!!!  I was slightly worried that listening to this soundtrack again after SO long might be a let down...  I needn't have worried... a superb bit of 'Bacharach & David' for old romantics everywhere.  Here's to us all finding our own Shangri-La out there somewhere. +music
Brilliant+P+Best moments here rival the best in pop history.  Essential album from the 90's.  Shimmering waves of silver light wash across a pitch-black canvas.  Ethereal and haunting like the most beautiful of dreams.  Like visiting heaven with your ears.  Highest recommendation possible+music
A Spanish Lily+P+The lovely shot of Gloria you're looking at is not misleading. The music inside is just as beautiful as the artist. Gloria has long used Spanish music to let her artistic soul flourish and this is her  masterpiece. This album is filled with beauty. If you love music and you want to hear the best of what it has to offer from around the world, then this is a perfect place to start.  Once the beautiful "With the Years That I Have Left" starts we are transported to an elegant and exotic club somewhere in South America. The sun has faded and a tropical moon has taken its place. The glossy hardwood counters are polished to perfection and the cherry finish complements a scattering of sego palms and Spanish lilies as wine glasses are filled with only the finest vintage.  Gloria's rich and emotional vocals surround the room and are backed by a lush orchestra and breezy spanish guitars. So rich is the atmosphere we can almost feel her moving around the room and smiling as she passes by our small table. The songs move from love of one's homeland to romantic love lost or waiting, and everything in-between.  Gloria fills this room with her magical phrasing of a beautiful language. We hear so many wonderful songs we dare not leave and miss a moment. There are songs of forgiveness and hope, and songs of true love and hanging on 'till the one lost to you returns. One song, the light and playful "Si Senor!" conjurs up images of the Andrew Sisters and another time.   One of the prettier songs we hear before our time in this moonlit paradise is over is "Volveras" (You'll Be Back). Gloria knows the man leaving her for another and taking her heart with him will be back, because he can't erase her memory. But we know it's only a song. No one could be foolish enough to leave this Cuban flower.  And all at once, it is over, and like all vacations, it has ended much too quickly. But what we've seen and heard has enriched and expanded our world. We want to come back once in awhile to feel like this again. Lucky for us we own this little keepsake of our time with Gloria in tropical paradise.+music
boy on fire+P+FIRST OF ALL THE BOY IS STR8 FROM BATON ROUGE JUST LIKE LIL BOOSIE, MAXMINELLI, LIL WEBBIE,C-LOC AND J-VON. ALL THESE BOYS ARE GANGSTA'S IN THIS GAME AND BEEN DOIN IT FOR A MIN+music
No staying power+N+A very lackluster effort.  Sophomoric lyrics and for the most part had nothing to distinguish itself.  I liked the title track a lot, and a couple of other ballad type songs, but the rest was poorly done and little imagination+music
Idea vs. Execution+N+2 1/2 stars   Attempting another soundscape masterpiece, Stratosphere has not aged so well. The music - simple, the production- dated, the performances- uninspired. There are attempts at greatness, hints of interesting fusions try to breathe a different life into the hollow art of looping. Mostly though this is more akin to like acts such as Jarre or Kraftwerk then their more inspired material. Whereas on an album like Phaedra, the mechanics of their repetition somehow liberated, on Stratosphere the mechanics enslave entire compositions into tight neat little boxes to look at, rather then truly feel. The self conscious songwriting further keeps the experience at bay, but if you concentrate more on the spaces in between the generically frustrating  fast synth-bass-cheese, you might feel a few conceptual ideas worth the investment.+music
Merengue Music for Christians!+P+Juan Luis Guerra crea nuevamente canciones apasionantes, esta vez demostrando su "vida nueva". El ritmo sin embargo es el mismo "sabroso pa' bailar" de siempre+music
20/20... The Forgotten Gem+P+The only reason I gave this four stars is because it's combined with Friends, which with the exception of  Meant For You & the title song is just OK, in my opinion. 20/20, however is loaded with phenomenal songs. Do It Again,I Can Hear Music,Be With Me, Time To Get Alone,Our Prayer(a capella at it's best), etc. For some reason, critics never even gave this album a chance and I don't know why. Maybe it didn't fit the late 60's groove that was going on, but still the lyrics are strong and the harmonies are fantastic. Yes, there is that one song, "Never Learn not to Love", whose lyrics were written by Charles Manson, but the way the song is done by The Beach Boys is just too good to pass off just because of who wrote it. This 2 CD set also includes Break Away and We're Together Again, which are also excellent songs that never received any airplay. The only 2 songs that did were Do It Again and I Can Hear Music. My advice is to buy this while you can. You won't be disappointed!+music
Pure Genius+P+Longesome Crowded West just somehow works. Everyone should have a listen! Polar Opposites is my favorite song of all time.+music
Long Awaited Black & Blue and Tobacco Road+P+It's very hard for me to be objective about these two recordings by Lou Rawls and Onzy Matthews.  I wore out my vinyl long, long ago and have been waiting for the CD issue of these records for 20 years.  FINALLY!  Great and creative big band writing by Onzy Matthews....The arrangements never get in Lou's way and such mature singing for a young guy.  Lou's in great voice, the selection of material is first rate and the writing and playing top notch.  Enough with the cliches........buy it..at two for the price of one+music
Don't Bother+N+There's a reason that there are over 200,000 albums ranked before this  one.  Even if I was a big fan of rap, I would be a fan of bad rap.  If you  enjoy droning, monotone vocals with no real music to back it up then maybe  this is for you, but even then I wouldn't recommend it.  Maybe try Grits or  something (try anything else... please!!)+music
Mass Hypnosis+N+The only thing that can account for the acclaim that some have lavished on this album is mass hypnosis.  Signor Bocelli's publicists have declared that he has 'the most beautiful voice in the world' and people believe it.  I agree with the reviewer who described listening to this cd as painful.  Everything sounds the same---like sandpaper.  If he were not adorable and blind, this fellow would not have a career even as a pop artist, never mind opera singer.  If you want to hear what opera sounds like at its best and most real today, check out Ramon Vargas, Juan Diego Florez, Rolando Villazon, Marcello Giordani and discover the difference between creme brulee and instant pudding+music
Those Great Bond Songs...+P+75% of the tracks on this CD are great. Takes you back to all the first times you saw the new bond film. Great insert, nice CD+music
magnificient !+P+Despite the few bad reviews I've read, I decided to buy the CD and decide by myself. And I don't regret it. The songs may not be easy to listen, but like any good book or great piece of art are hard to read and understand, if you are willing to get delighted by real music, you'll get it . There's lots of talent on this CD. It made my imagination and philosophies fly, made me cheerful, made me sad. My favorite songs: it;s hard to decide between so many. It brightenly opens with " No more a-roving" which, regardless of not containing  Leonard's lyrics, he makes of this poem such a song !!!  I love to listen to it while in my deck on a clear full moon night. "Nightingale" lifts up my mood so much and makes me feel so much at home (specially because I live in the mountains/woods) and am a nature/wildlife lover. "The Faith", just soothes my soul and relaxes me so much that takes me floating to the highest cloud, while listening to it watching the sun set on a cold afternoon....But right away I get up and start dancing to the tunes of "Tennessee Waltz, which  IS NOT OUT OF TUNE like some reviewer mentioned. Here, Leonard is singing as imitating a "country/folk " singer due to the roots of the song. I love that song too ! In summary: I have to clean my CD, because i had played it over and over, and over and over...and I think it's dirty now...Like they said: "In the repetition you'll find the taste" Leonard's voice and Anjani's vocals make an amazing contrast. I give this CD a "FIVE" . Some may say because it fits my personality. I love contrast . I like being sad and then happy right after. I like to sooth my soul. I like Leonard Cohen+music
The James Dean of Jazz+P+This, ladies and gentlemen, may be the best vocal Jazz album I have ever heard (I say have heard because I've only listened to maybe fifteen albums in the genre). By just destroying any credentials I had in the previous statement, lets move on to the review. This is a West Coast Jazz classic, truly one of the most overlooked outputs of the Cool School of Jazz. While not as technically competant as "Kind of Blue", I manage to listen to it just as much, if not more. Every song included on this disc is a classic standard, and Baker's version of "My Funny Valentine" is the greatest version of the song, beating out Sinatra's rendition by a mile. The instrumentation itself is flawless, as Mr. Baker's trumpet playing guides the band. He was as adept at the trumpet as he was at singing. The low-key and minimalist style of the band is perfect for the songs, and is one of the best bands in Jazz history. Influential and flawless, this is a must-have for any fan of post-war Jazz+music
